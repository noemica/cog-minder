Small ideas:
- Enforce proper headings (heading 1 -> 2 -> 3) and no skips (heading 1 -> 3) in wiki
- Add support for broad categories in wiki part groups so I don't have to keep updating for every new part

Medium ideas:
- Add ignore obsolete parts in search
    - Hard to know what an "obsolete" part is
- Add proper followups for build page
- Add overloads to build page
- Add drag/drop to spreadsheet view
    - https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/intelligent-tereshkova-sqo7wj?embed=1&file=%2Fsrc%2Fmain.tsx%3A50%2C4&theme=light
- Show relevant stat when sorting parts page
- Add custom bot/part info to wiki

Big ideas:
- Add graph of part stats, allow any 2 axes to be selected

- Combat log ideas
    - Add support for filtering damage entries, e.g. specific bot target/damage type
