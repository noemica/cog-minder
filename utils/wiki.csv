"Achievements","Other","There are currently 256 achievements in Cogmind, which can be viewed in-game through the Achievements records submenu. They are divided into several categories organized by color, with the appearance of their borders sometimes providing additional information. 81 of the 256 Achievements have hidden descriptions that are only revealed after completing them.

Visually, Achievements are tile-based 5x5 squares. While an Achievement is locked, the inner 3x3 square is made out of question marks. Unlocking an Achievement changes the inner 3x3 square to visually represent the Achievement's requirements/results. The tiles on the border of the 5x5 square almost never change when the Achievement is unlocked. [[Comment]]Those achievements are ""Stardust"" and ""Planet Killer"". this is because Wins Achievements' inner art isn't a square but more of a cog, so some of the outer border tiles are part of said art, even if it's just a matching background. This dark green background is the same for all Wins Achievements, except those two. The locked versions, however, still have that dark green background.[[/Comment]]

"Alert","Other","Alert is an underlying mechanic throughout the game that describes Cogmind's apparent threat level to [[0b10]]. It only comes into play in 0b10-controlled maps, primarily on main floors like [[Materials]] or [[Factory]] or a few 0b10 branches. It can be increased by many ways, most often by getting spotted or destroying bots or parts of the level. Alert does naturally dissipate over time, although combat-oriented strategies will almost always generate much more alert than the dissipation rate.
Alert is normally hidden throughout the game, although it can be revealed through a few different ways. [[RIF]]-alignment gives a permanent influence number and alert level indicator on the UI at all times. The [[0b10 Alert Chip]] gives the same indication when equipped. Additionally, alert level can be checked by using the [[GameText]]check_alert[[/GameText]] hack when using a [[Datajacks|Datajack]] on an [[Operator]], or by using the [[GameText]]Alert(Check)[[/GameText]] hack at a [[Terminal]].
There are 2 aspects of the Alert level. The first is the ""influence"" number, which is the numeric representation of alert. This can only be seen when using RIF or the Alert Chip. The other, the alert level, is an approximation of the influence. Low security is the lowest level of alert when the influence number is less than 200 and does not have any additional information. However, alert levels 1 through 4 are all divided into 26 alphabetical subsections. For example, alert level 1 begins at 200 and ends at 399 influence. Checking the alert level while at 200 influence will report ""1-A"", and checking at 399 will report ""1-Z"". This can be used to approximate the influence number, although the exact number does not really matter.
[[Heading]]Alert levels[[/Heading]]
[[Table]]Alert level|Minimum Value|Maximum Value||Low Security|0|199||1|200|399||2|400|699||3|700|1199||4|1200|1599||5|1600|No Max[[/Table]]
Alert level controls only a few aspects of the game: [[Assault Squad|Assaults]], [[Patrol Squad|Searches]], and [[High Security]]. Alert level does not increase the number of patrols or guards on the map in any way. Alert below level 2 does not have any impact on the game. At alert level 2/400 influence, Assaults and [[Search Patrol|Search Patrols]] can start being dispatched. From this point onward, alert is a sliding scale. Increased alert will also increase the overall frequency of Assaults and the number of [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]] that will be dispatched as part of an Assault. Alert level 2 typically only sends a single ARC per Assault wave, but higher alert levels can see two or more being sent frequently.
[[High Security]] is the other affect of alert. It is a special alert level that can only be triggered when at level 5 alert when combat hostiles are destroyed. The higher the influence value, the higher the chance of triggering High Security. [[Maximum Security]] has similar effects as High Security, but is not related to alert except that it sets influence to 1600 if it is lower than that.
[[Heading]]Ways to raise alert[[/Heading]]

[[List:Ordered]]Successful hacking increases alert more if the hack is less likely to succeed. Alert does not increase at all from hacks with a success rate of >= 30%.[[/List]]
There are also modifiers that can affect how much alert is gained by a certain percentage. The 0b10 Alert Chip reduces all influence gains by 20%, and the RIF ability Threat Obfuscation reduces all gains by 25%, 40%, or 50% depending on level. All alert reduction is rounded down, and reduction will not take place unless the value is at least 1. For example, gaining 3 influence from destroying a wall on -2 with the Alert Chip equipped results in 0.6 reduction which rounds down to 0. With this 20% reduction, only influence gains of 5 or more will have any reduction applied. On the other hand, having blue or purple allies within a 20-tile radius will increase alert gain from destroying bots. The gain is roughly 12.5% per ally, capping out at an additional 100% alert gain at 8 nearby allies. This effect can be cancelled out by the RIF ability Alert ID Control. In general, be cautious of taking large groups of allies into combat or else alert can quite easily skyrocket.
[[Heading]]Ways to lower alert[[/Heading]]
Lowering alert tends to be quite a bit more difficult than gaining it in the first place for most builds. The best way to dissipate large amounts of alert is to exit the map, as a large percentage of current alert is taken away immediately. Going into [[Caves]] in [[Factory]] branches is even better. By the end of several Caves maps, alert will most likely have dropped down to 0. This alert reduction effect lessens the higher up Cogmind is in the complex, and the amount varies depending on whether Cogmind is exiting into a branch map or a new main depth. Some maps always have fixed alert reduction percentages regardless of floor.
[[Heading:2]]Exit alert influence reduction[[/Heading]]
[[Table]]Depth|Branch|Next main floor|Garrison exit to depth||-10|61%|57.8%|N/A||-9|61%|57.8%|N/A||-8|57.8%|54.5%|51.25%||-7|54.5%|51%|47.5%||-6|51%|51%|47.5%||-5|51%|51%|47.5%||-4|51%|47.5%|47.5%||-3|47.5%|43.75%|43.75%||-2|43.75%|40%|43.75%||-1|36%|N/A|40%[[/Table]]

[[Heading:2]]Passive alert reduction[[/Heading]]
The most substantial alert reduction method aside from exiting the map is a passive alert reduction over time. Every 400 turns, influence will decrease by a diminishing value that starts at 200. Each time alert is reduced, the value decreases by 25%.
[[Table]]Turn|Alert influence reduction|Cumulative reduction||400|200|200||800|150|350||1200|112|462||1600|84|546||2000|63|609||2400|47|656||2800|35|691||3200|26|717||3600|19|736||4000|14|750||4400|10|760||4800|7|767||5200|5|772||5600|3|775||6000|2|777||6400|1|778[[/Table]]
[[Heading:2]]Other alert influence reduction[[/Heading]]
There are a few other miscellaneous ways of decreasing alert:
[[Table]]Method|Alert influence reduction||Cogmind part destroyed by combat hostile|10||Non-combat ally destroyed by combat hostile|10||Combat ally destroyed by combat hostile|20||Alert(Purge) [[Terminal]] hack|150||purge_threat [[Operator]] RIF hack|150 [[Sub]]1[[/Sub]][[/Table]]
[[List:Ordered]]Each purge_threat hack reduces the amount of influence reduced by 25 until the minimum value of 50 is reached. So purging will reduce by 150, 125, 100, 75, and remain at 50. This number resets back to 150 with each new map.[[/List]]","","","","","",""
"Alignment","Other","Alignments are a major part of Cogmind's journey each run. They can provide unique capabilities or trigger certain events, but often lock other pieces of content out as inaccessible. Some factions change large aspects of Cogmind's normal interaction with the game world, while others only trigger a specific event in the game. Some can provide unique [[Wintypes]]. Selecting factions wisely is an important part of a run.
[[Heading]]List of alignments[[/Heading]]
[[List]][[Core Reset Matrix]] (CRM), [[Sigix]] alignment: The CRM is a lategame consumable [[Alien Artifacts|Alien Artifact]] that provides a variety of unique abilities, with the most substantial benefit being the instant detection of all other Alien Artifacts upon consumption or entering a new map. The major downside is a memory wipe that removes most of Cogmind's knowledge. Consuming it also angers a few other factions and locks out certain events.|[[Farcom]], [[Exiles (Group)|Exiles]] alignment: An early game alignment that provides a permanent 18-tile radius combat bot sensor in all [[0b10]]-controlled floors as well as 1 type of unique Exile prototype. Its major downsides are locking out Imprint and a harsh penalty when entering [[Research]] branches [[Testing]], [[Quarantine]], and [[Section 7]].|[[Imprint]], [[Zion]] alignment: A midgame alignment that dramatically changes [[Terminal]] hacking. All standard Terminal hacks are removed and replaced with special random Zion ally summons and intel. Imprint is a powerful but tricky alignment to use due to the loss of standard Terminal hacking. Imprinting also locks Cogmind out of gaining the aid of several other Derelict factions.|[[Redacted]][[MAIN.C]] surrender - 0b10 alignment: This lategame alignment only becomes available in [[Command]] after defeating the [[MAIN.C (Shell)|MAIN.C Shell]] and enables a particular win, w8 by fighting off waves of [[Enhanced Q-Series]]. Surrendering to MAIN.C locks Cogmind out of several ending types, as well as the ability to enter [[Access_0]].[[/Redacted]]|[[Relay Interface Framework]] (RIF), 0b10 alignment: An alignment available as early as [[Materials]], RIF allows for much greater control of 0b10 complex bots through the use of special hacks via [[Relay Couplers]]. RIF also provides many unique abilities that make traversing the complex safer or easier. The major downside of RIF is that several [[Derelict]] factions will be unable to identify Cogmind as friendly and will instead turn hostile.|[[Revision 17 (Alignment)|Revision 17 Alignment]]: [[Revision 17]] is a quite unique Derelict that can be rescued in [[Cetus]]. Revision 17's role is not a large one, but its -3 Research invasion can stir up some trouble and hopefully provide some aid in Research.|[[Redacted]][[Sigix Exoskeleton]], Sigix alignment: The Sigix Exoskeleton is an immensely powerful and gamechanging build type available late in the game in Section 7. It provides Cogmind with lots of firepower, a massive amount of map intel, and fast and high integrity and coverage exoskeleton part. The downsides to the Exoskeleton are reduced slot count (down to 1-3-3-2 initially), a decently low maximum support, and the full weight of 0b10's [[Maximum Security]] sent after Cogmind whenever spotted. This item is very powerful, but drastically changes gameplay for the rest of the run compared to most other alignments.[[/Redacted]]|[[UFD|United Federation of Derelicts]] alignment: The UFD is a Derelict group whose home is in the 0b1 Old Recycling map [[Scraptown]]. Their major benefits include some unique parts available on the map and their ability to summon [[Scrapoid|Scrapoids]] from [[Recycling Machine|Recycling Machines]].|[[Warlord (Alignment)|Warlord Alignment]]: [[Warlord]] is a unique and much beloved Derelict that wages war on 0b10 whose help can be obtained in the midgame. His -2 Research assault is similar to Revision 17's but on a much grander scale. Lots of loot can be found wherever Warlord goes. He can also make an appearance in the [[Redacted]][[Command]] cave seals[[/Redacted]], which can even lead to a unique wintype. The [[Encrypted Comm Array]] also falls under this alignment and turns destruction of 0b10 [[Garrison|Garrisons]] and [[DSF|DSFs]] into more powerful Warlord forces.|[[Zhirov (Alignment)|Zhirov Alignment]]: [[Zhirov]] is another unique Derelict who can provide a big help in the lategame. Grabbing the [[SGEMP Prototype]] in Testing provides a few temporary allies (including Zhirov himself) and full map intel of [[Access]], a notoriously difficult map. His quest can continue on in [[Redacted]]Command, where his Modified SGEMP can disable the whole map's worth of 0b10 bots when the MAIN.C Shell is defeated.[[/Redacted]][[/List]]

"Assault Squad","Other","Assault squads are [[0b10]] aligned [[Squad|squads]] that are sent after Cogmind as a result of having too high [[Alert]]. Assaults are sent directly to Cogmind's position with [[Perfect Tracking]] and cannot be easily shaken. They consist of a single [[C-30 ARC]] typically containing 5 bots inside. If Cogmind has 3 or more allies, up to 2 additional bots may be sent to escort the ARC as additional firepower. Assault squads can be both Enumerated and Recalled at [[Terminal|Terminals]].
An alert indicates whenever an Assault squad is dispatched. Additionally, the log will display a message like [[GameText]]ALERT: Significant disruption in zone 9B, assault force dispatched[[/GameText]]. If more than one ARC was sent, the message will instead indicate [[GameText]]multiple assault carriers dispatched[[/GameText]].
[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]
[[Lore]]WAR.Sys Records|Assault Squad[[/Lore]]
[[Heading]]Frequency and Number[[/Heading]]
Assaults may be dispatched regularly as long as Cogmind is at least Alert level 2 or 400 influence, although at lower Alert levels Assaults are rare. At Alert levels well above 1000, Assaults may be sent out at nearly opportunity. A higher Alert level also increases the chances of multiple ARCs being dispatched. In [[Materials]], Assaults can be dispatched every 400 turns on -9 and -8. In [[Factory]] and above, this changes to be every 250 turns. If an Assault would be dispatched at the same time an [[Extermination Squad]] would be dispatched, the Assault is delayed by 50 turns. Most assault waves consists of 1-2 ARCs, but at Alert levels in excess of 5X/1600 influence, 3 or even more ARCs can be sent.
[[Heading:2]]During [[High Security|High]] or [[Maximum Security]][[/Heading]]
The frequency, number, and contents of ARCs changes. Assault forces with stronger compositions than usual may be dispatched in these conditions, although these ARCs only have 4 bots inside rather than the typical 5. 4 ARCs will be dispatched 100 turns into High Security and after another 100 turns. After that, 2 more ARCs will be added to each wave, but 50 more turns will be added in between the dispatch of each wave. The sizes of the Assault waves will also start to increase each wave, and the duration between each wave will increase. Maximum Security is similar, but with 6 ARCs to start the first 2 waves. The 2nd wave of Assaults in High Security and all subsequent waves, and all waves of Maximum Security may contain stronger than usual bots in them.
[[Heading]]Assault Contents[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Assault Contents.png|Example contents of an Assault squad ARC[[/Image]]
Assault contents can vary by depth, but their makeups are always similar. Assaults will always contain 4 combat bots and 1 support-type bot. The combat bots may become stronger under heavy assault conditions, but the possible support bots are always the same.

[[Spoiler]][[Heading]][[Data Miner]] redirection[[/Heading]]
The Data Miner can redirect Assaults if his help is obtained by visiting his [[Data Miner (Location)|hideout]]. If redirected, Assaults will roam around a random area of the map rather than head directly to Cogmind's location. The Data Miner has a 50% chance to direct each ARC as part of an Assault about 15 turns after each Assault is dispatched, if Cogmind is determined as ""needing assistance"". Redirection can only occur when High/Maximum Security is not active. If a redirect happens, the alert [[GameText]]Higher priority target acquired, redirecting assault.[[/GameText]] will be displayed. If an Assault is not redirected, there is a further 50% chance that the contents may be redirected after the ARC opens up. This can happen within 30 turns of the ARC opening. This effect will only redirect the squad leader, and the squad leader will only leave if currently unable to see Cogmind. All the remaining squad bots will continue to follow Cogmind. The true practical effect here is that if the squad forgets where Cogmind is, they will patrol around the redirected location rather than the location that the ARC opened.[[/Spoiler]]","","","","","",""

"Cargo Convoy","Other","[[Image]]Cargo Convoy.png|Intact cargo convoy[[/Image]]
[[Image]]Cargo Convoy Deployed.png|A cargo convoy with ARCs deployed[[/Image]]
Cargo convoys are a special form of [[Transport Squad|transport squads]] that can be found from -7 to -2 on main [[Factory]] and [[Research]] floors. They consist of a single [[A-27 Freighter]], a [[Protector]], and two [[C-30 ARC|C-30 ARCs]] full of 4 combat bots and an extra utility bot, similar to strong [[Assault Squad|assaults]]. The parts contained within a Freighter are all [[Prototype Part|prototype]] or [[Authchips]], never faulty, and can be up to 3 ratings out of depth. For example, on -7, Haulers can contain up to rating 4 prototype parts. A cargo convoy Freighter can carry rating 5-7 prototype parts.
Cargo convoys are always preceded by 3-5 [[Swarmer|Swarmers]] that scout out the path of the convoy before it appears. The alert [[GameText]]Cargo convoy en route, clear transfer corridor.[[/GameText]] will indicate when this is happening. A few turns later, the Freighter and guards will appear and take the same route.
Cargo convoys will always appear at a 0b10 controlled exit and head to a [[Garrison (Machine)|Garrison]]. Typically the Freighter leads the way and stays ahead of the Protector and ARCs, which normally trail a few tiles behind. A [[Transport Network Coupler]] or [[Modified TNC]] will reveal the planned path of the Freighter. The Modified TNC will also show the contents of the Freighter. The Manifests hack will also show all the parts contained by the Freighter.
[[Heading]]Unique parts[[/Heading]]
There are 2 fully unique Cargo Convoy drops as well as one semi-unique drop:
[[List]][[Active Cooling Armor]]: Only obtainable from Cargo Convoy|[[Exp. Thermic Cannon]]: Only obtainable from Cargo Convoy|[[PL-3XN's Ring of Power]]: Only obtainable from one Cargo Convoy per run. Can be found in other locations.[[/List]]
[[Heading]]Attack response[[/Heading]]
If a cargo convoy is attacked, a message will indicate this, as well as an alert: [[GameText]]ALERT: Cargo convoy interrupted, initiating access lockdown.[[/GameText]] 100 turns after this, a [[Heavy]] will spawn at an 0b10 controlled exit or Garrison every 100 turns until all exits are guarded by a Heavy. Heavies may head toward a far away [[Caves]] exit in order to guard it. The Freighter will begin running away in a random direction when attacked. If it is not destroyed, it will head toward another nearby 0b10 controlled exit.
[[Heading]][[Derelict]] attack[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Cargo Convoy Attack.png|Derelicts from a Garrison ready to assault a convoy[[/Image]]
There is a chance that Derelicts will decide to attack a cargo convoy. The chance is higher at lower depths. If they attack, they will appropriate a Garrison machine, rig some [[Dirty Bomb Trap|Dirty Bomb Traps]], and attack the convoy guards. If they are successful, they will retreat and leave the loot available for Cogmind. This may happen even if Cogmind is nowhere near the convoy. It may be a good idea to track the Freighter position in case this happens, even if not planning to attack the convoy directly, since this can often result in lots of powerful free loot. If Cogmind is not close enough to grab the loot, [[Recycler|Recyclers]] may have carried it off to a nearby [[Recycling Machine]]. Make sure to check these if the Freighter's stash can't be found nearby.

"Cave-ins","Other","Cave-ins are a [[Game Mechanics|Game Mechanic]] where dug-out tiles will collapse and instantly deal a large amount of Impact damage to anything on the tile. It is safe to dig up to 3 tiles safely in some circumstances, but long distance digging is always unsafe.
[[Heading]]Causes of cave-ins[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Destabilized Tiles.png|Destabilized tiles are bright red as shown by a Structural Scanner[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]]Destabilization[[/Heading]]
Destabilized tiles are tiles that will always collapse if given enough time. They may collapse instantly or they may last a hundred turns or more. Destabilized tiles can be viewed with a [[Structural Scanner]]. A tile can become destabilized in two ways:
[[List]]Explosive damage - Explosive damage (namely [[Launchers]]) will cause a tile to destabilized.|Attacking from a dug out tile - If Cogmind or any other bot fires a weapon inside of a dug out tile, the tile will destabilize. This tile may collapse instantly before Cogmind gets a chance to move, so digging from inside these tiles is never completely safe.[[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]Dug-out tile traversal[[/Heading]]
It is safe to travel through dug out tiles (that are not destabilized) for up to 3 tiles, but they have to be wall-earth-wall or wall-wall-wall tiles. For a longer dig, wall-earth-earth is not safe. Each tile traversed past that safe limit will risk an instant cave-in.
[[Heading]]Example digs[[/Heading]]

[[Heading]]Avoiding cave-ins[[/Heading]]
Here are some strategies to avoid cave-ins
[[List]]Don't use melee to dig more than 1 tile - Melee weapons need to be adjacent to the next tile to dig out. This means Cogmind will have to be in a dug out tile to dig two consecutive tiles which allows a chance for an immediate destabilization cave-in.|Don't use Explosive Launchers to dig - While Launchers can dig out a lot of tiles at once, those tiles have a chance to collapse as Cogmind walks through. Note: it is safe to do this with a Structural Scanner equipped, as destabilized tiles will be visible and are avoidable.|Use Thermal or Kinetic cannons - These cannons have a high base damage that is typically strong enough to dig through most non-reinforced walls. It is safe to dig a 3 tile path ahead of time and then walk through at no risk of cave-in.|Be wary of [[U-05 Engineer|Engineers]] - Engineers may seal off your path and leave you stuck in the wall, forced to dig again to escape and risk immediate cave-in.[[/List]]","","","","","",""

"Challenges Achievements","Other","Challenges [[Achievements]] are earned by completing certain challenging feats, demonstrating the player's large experience with the game. Only some of them are likely to be obtained naturally by players not actively trying to earn them. 2 of the 27 Challenges Achievements have hidden descriptions that are only revealed after completing them. The borders of Challenges Achievements tend to indicate their general difficulty as a Challenges Achievement[[Comment]]Rincewind being the biggest exception. Why is that one considered ""easy""? It's basically the most difficult one in here.[[/Comment]], with more ""intense"" borders meaning higher difficulty.

[[Comment]]This warning is supposed to be there for all articles about achievement types, including those that do not have any Redacted-level spoilers.[[/Comment]]
(The visibility for the explanations, strategies and descriptions of hidden achievements is set to at least ""Spoilers"", and may be set to ""Redacted"" for achievements where that would be relevant. Remember to change your spoilers settings to ""None"" if you do not wish to see the explanations, strategies and descriptions of hidden achievements you have not yet obtained!)

Warning: The writer of this article has not yet earned the ""Full Golem"" Achievement, and as such its description in this page is a (likely accurate) guess instead of being the official description.

[[Comment]]Important note : A lot of Challenges Achievements' descriptions mention by name some spoiler-tier stuff, such as the Cetus Guards or Transdimensional Reconstructors.
Normally, these names would be contained within a Link tag.
However, because those Achievements' descriptions are not hidden by the game (the descriptions themselves aren't spoiler-tier), these names should not be contained within a Link tag, because that would cause them to appear spoilered to anyone with a spoiler setting of ""None"".[[/Comment]]

[[Heading]]Challenge difficulty level 1[[/Heading]]
[[List]]Exterminator: Destroy 15 [[Assembled]] in the [[Mines]].
Strategy: This Achievement is seed-dependent, and may be impossible on some seeds. When attempting to get this Achievement on a random seed, visit the Mines and bring at least one [[Launchers|launcher]]. If an Assembled infestation occurs, try to find and reach the source as quickly as possible, to be able to blow up the Assembled while they are still in a somewhat large group. Having a [[Seismic Detector]] can help locate the Assembled faster.
|Killing Spree: Achieve a kill streak of 20 hostiles.
|Preemptive Strike: Destroy a visible [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] before it deploys.
|Left-hand Path: Destroy all Cetus Guards without any help from allies.
|Below: Visit and survive 2 [[Wastes|Waste]] areas.
|Streaker: Enter a main complex map at -5 or above as a naked core, and find an exit (do not have to remain naked).
|Rincewind: Use at least 10 Transdimensional Reconstructors (any variant).
|Leap Before You Look: Enter 10 unidentified exits.
Strategy: It is possible to deduce the identity of exits without actually ""identifying"" the exit, through various means. For example, successfully hacking branch exits would cause all remaining unidentified exits to be main exits, and vice-versa. It is also possible to identify some exits by where they are or what's around them, such as [[Mines]] exits, which are always surrounded by mining equipment. This is especially true in branches, where all exits are distinguishable from each other. This can allow entering exits the game considers ""unidentified"", while actually knowing where they lead, making this Achievement much easier. If you have a [[Signal Interpreters|Signal Interpreter]] attached, remember to deactivate it before approaching any exits you would want to take while unidentified, as it would automatically identify them.[[/List]]

|Rambo: Earn 10,000 bonus points for high alert combat kills.
|Most Wanted: Trigger [[High Security|high security]] 4 times.
|404: Destroy 4 Network Hubs and escape to the next floor.
|Full Golem: [[Spoiler]]Fully integrate all possible parts from a [[GOLEM Unit]].[[/Spoiler]][[Comment]]TODO: This is the achievement with a description that i just guessed. I know it to be technically accurate, but it isn't the same as the actual achievement's description.

"Companion Sword","Part","The Companion Sword is a unique talking melee weapon that can only appear in [[Scraptown]]. It is contained in a room called The Sword, locked for the protection of [[Derelict|Derelicts]], none of whom have survived using the Companion Sword for long. The Companion Sword is quite talkative and will often comment about the state of the run, take pleasure in destroying things, and complain if it is detached or is not the only weapon attached. The Companion Sword has a variety of special effects that are not described by the in-game effect.

After consuming the CRM and when entering a new map, the locations and types of all Alien Artifacts are revealed on the map. The part IDs of all Alien Artifacts are also granted to Cogmind.
[[Heading:3]]Alien Language Understanding[[/Heading]]
Cogmind will be able to understand the speech of the [[Sigix Containment Pod]] when rescued.
[[Redacted]][[Heading:3]]Cave Seal Allies[[/Heading]]
If a Command cave seal is opened and Cogmind is not Imprinted or allied with [[Warlord]], cave seals will initially contain 1 Golem and 10-13 Assembled.[[/Redacted]]
[[Heading:3]][[Corruption]] Cleanse[[/Heading]]
Corruption is reset to 0%.
[[Heading:3]]Hypermatrix Pings[[/Heading]]
When Cogmind's core reaches below 33%, Cogmind will emit a hypermatrix ping and 6-8 Assembled will spawn next to Cogmind. This only happens on main [[0b10]] floors and in [[Command]]. After this, Cogmind will be able to detect further hypermatrix pings at a range of 18 tiles of other groups of assembled. Coming within a few tiles of these pings with visual contact will cause a further 6-8 Assembled to pop out.
[[Heading:3]]Memory Reset[[/Heading]]
Cogmind loses all map data, part IDs, [[Robot Analysis|Analyses]], [[Schematic|Schematics]], [[Data Conduit|Data Conduit intel]], [[RIF]] alliance, [[A7 Data Core|A7 Data Core intel]], and any manual [[Terminal]] or robot hacks. Notably, Cogmind will not lose [[Farcom]] or Imprint.
[[Heading:3]]Non-Alien Hostilities[[/Heading]]
Certain groups will no longer trust Cogmind as a result of using a CRM. If [[Zhirov]] shows up in [[Access]] as a result of completing the [[SGEMP Prototype]] quest, he and his allies will immediately turn hostile to Cogmind. [[Redacted]]The surrender option is no is no longer offered by [[MAIN.C]], causing the W8 [[Wintypes|Wintype]] to be unobtainable.[[/Redacted]]
[[Redacted]][[Heading:3]][[Sigix Exoskeleton]] Control[[/Heading]]
Cogmind is able to pilot the Exoskeleton located in [[Section 7]].[[/Redacted]]
[[Heading:3]]Unique Wintype[[/Heading]]
Taking a [[Surface]] exit after using a CRM awards the W2 wintype.
[[Heading]]Where to find[[/Heading]]

"Coupling Squad","Other","[[Image]]Coupling Squad.png|A Programmer installing Relay Couplers into a Garrison[[/Image]]
Coupling squads are [[0b10]] aligned [[Squad|squads]] that are sent to restock [[Garrison (Machine)|Garrison Machines]] with [[Relay Couplers]]. They can appear on any 0b10 floor that contains a Garrison as well as on the inside of [[Garrison|Garrisons]]. They consist of a single [[Programmer]] carrying 3-4 Relay Couplers. The Programmer is 1 tier above typical Programmers for the depth. For example, a typical -7 Programmer is a [[P-60 Hacker]], but a coupling squad will instead be a [[P-70 Sage]].
Coupling squads are dispatched if a Garrison has no Relay Couplers in its builtin inventory. Garrison machines usually contain 3-4 Couplers at all times, but sometimes one will be present on initial map entry with none. Full Garrisons will also lose their inventory over time and become empty. In either case, a Programmer will eventually be called to that Garrison to restock the Couplers. When a coupling squad Programmer reaches its target Garrison, a message like [[GameText]]P-70 Sage installs Relay Coupler [Grunt] into garrison access.[[/GameText]] will appear in the log. After all the couplers are installed, the Programmer will exit through the Garrison.
[[Heading]]Intentional dispatching[[/Heading]]
Coupling squads can also dispatched if Cogmind uses the [[Spoiler]]Trojan(Restock)[[/Spoiler]] hack. If this is done, log text similar to [[GameText]]ALERT: Unscheduled coupler replacement inbound for Garrison vPm.7n.[[/GameText]] will appear after a few turns. A similar restock effect will occur if Cogmind uses the [[Spoiler]]Force(Eject)[[/Spoiler]] hack.","","","","","",""

"Encrypted Comm Array","Part","The Encrypted Comm Array, or ECA, is a [[Warlord]]-aligned item that enables summoning various groups of [[Derelict]] allies on main [[0b10]] floors. It can be obtained by performing any of the actions that increase the ECA force multiplier listed below. After this, a Derelict will appear in the next [[Caves]] map and deliver the Array, give some more details on its usage, and reveal the depth of [[Warlord (Location)]]. The ECA cannot be used if Cogmind has been [[Imprint|Imprinted]] or made use of a [[RIF|RIF installer]], as these alignments are mutually exclusive with Warlord.
[[Heading]]Summoning squads[[/Heading]]
Equipping the ECA on any main 0b10 floor will reveal up to 8 squads available for summoning. Each time a squad is summoned, the force multiplier is decreased by 0.01. Moving over one of the squad indicators on the map will summon several white colored [[Alert]]-free allies that will follow Cogmind around the map, but will not follow to any other maps. These bots also do not gain trap location knowledge from Cogmind like purple or blue allies, so they may move over known traps. The squads do not get stronger as depth increases, so they have less utility in late [[Factory]] and [[Research]] depths. All squads have a chance of containing a [[Surgeon]] that will repair any allied bots as well as Cogmind. The available squads are:
[[List]]Chimera Squad: [[Mutant|Mutants]]|Dakka Squad: [[Wasp|Wasps]]|Muscle Squad: [[Butcher|Butchers]] and [[Savage|Savages]]|Geek Squad: [[Wizard|Wizards]]|Ghost Squad: [[Infiltrator|Infiltrators]]|Infantry Squad: [[Thug|Thugs]]|Pyro Squad: [[Fireman|Firemen]]|Ranger Squad: [[Guerrilla|Guerrillas]][[/List]]
If Cogmind meets Warlord at his base, the squad summoning and force multiplier reporting mechanics stop functioning, and there is no point to hold onto the ECA any longer.
[[Heading]]Force multiplier[[/Heading]]
The ECA brings an additional mechanic to Warlord alignment called the force multiplier. This value is reported every time Cogmind enters a new main 0b10 depth. The force multiplier affects several things:
[[List]]The total number of squads available to summon per map. This starts at 0 squads at a 1.00 force multiplier and caps at 8 at 1.08.|Special guard squads in the -2 [[Research]] Warlord assault event. Based on the performance tier, more bots and stronger squads can be summoned to aid Cogmind during the assault.|-1 [[Access]] spillover forces: In Access, additional Warlord forces will appear at the entrance to the map. More squads will appear with a higher force multiplier.|[[Redacted]]The [[Command]] seals will summon more and stronger bots based on the overall force multiplier.[[/Redacted]][[/List]]
The force multiplier tiers are as follows:
[[List]]D: 1.00 - 1.09|C: 1.10 - 1.19|B: 1.20 - 1.29|A: 1.30 - 1.39|S: 1.40+[[/List]]
The following are the ways that the force multiplier can be modified:
[[Table]]Method|Effect||Sterilizing a DSF|+ 0.10||Garrison interior compromised (once per Garrison)|+ 0.02||Destroying a RIF installer|+ 0.02||Destroying a Garrison Relay|+ 0.01||Destroying a Phase Generator|+ 0.01||Summoning an ECA squad|- 0.01||Ascending a depth|- 0.01[[/Table]]
[[Heading]]Additional abilities[[/Heading]]
The ECA has a unique ability that interacts with [[Heavy]]-summoned [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcement Squads]]. Occasionally, [[Specialist|Specialists]] summoned by the Heavy will reveal themselves to be [[Infiltrator|Infiltrators]] in disguise and turn friendly to Cogmind.
[[Heading]]Post-Warlord RIF[[/Heading]]
It is possible to install RIF after meeting Warlord. Warlord and his forces will not turn against Cogmind at this point, as they can only detect RIF inside of the Warlord base. However, doing so will lose some of the benefits. The -2 special guards will not appear based on the force multiplier. [[Redacted]]Additionally, fewer squads will be dispatched to follow Cogmind around from the Command seals. However, the seals will still have a higher number and more powerful bots based on the force multiplier as usual.[[/Redacted]]","","","","","",""

"Extermination Squad","Other","[[Image]]Extermination Squad.png|An Extermination Squad hunting down Cogmind[[/Image]]
Extermination squads are [[0b10]] aligned [[Squad|squads]] that are sent after Cogmind periodically in [[Factory]] (-7) and beyond. Exterminations are sent directly to Cogmind with [[Perfect Tracking]] and cannot easily be shaken. Extermination squads typically consist of 1-3 [[Programmer|Programmers]] based on the floor: 1 [[P-60 Hacker]] on -7 and -6, 1 or 2 [[P-70 Sage|P-70 Sages]] on -5 and -4, and 2 or 3 [[P-80 Master|P-80 Masters]] on -3 to -1. Extermination squads can be both Enumerated and Recalled at [[Terminal|Terminals]].
An alert will indicate whenever an an Extermination squad is dispatched. Additionally, the log will display a message like [[GameText]]ALERT: Rogue bot located, Programmers report to Factory Zone 5B.[[/GameText]]
[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]
[[Lore]]WAR.Sys Records|Extermination Squad[[/Lore]]
[[Heading]]Frequency[[/Heading]]
Extermination squads have a chance of being dispatched by every 250 turns when on most 0b10 maps. The higher the depth, the higher the chance that an Extermination will be sent. If Exterminations fail to be sent 3 times in a row, one will be sent after 1/3 of the average check time. For example, if no Extermination squad is sent for 750 turns, one will be sent in 1/3 of 250 turns, which is 84 turns, or 834 turns total. This means that there are 4 possible combinations of delay between Extermination squads.
The spawn timer can be delayed with [[Spoiler]]the [[RIF]] ability Zone Cloak[[/Spoiler]] or by sealing [[Garrison (Machine)|Garrison Machines]]. Both of these methods stack, and each provides +75 turns to each possible Extermination squad spawn. For example, closing 2 Garrisons while having [[Spoiler]]Zone Cloak 1[[/Spoiler]] will add 225 turns to the 250 turn timer, increasing it up to 475 turns.
The following table showcases possible time periods in between Extermination squads.

It is possible for Extermination Programmers to be replaced by 1-2 Q-Series instead. This can occur randomly if Cogmind gets scanned by a [[Researcher]] in [[Testing]] or [[Quarantine]]. These Q-Series have customized and randomized loadouts, but will behave in the same way as regular Extermination squads do. This includes heading straight for Cogmind with perfect tracking, and the ability to be recalled at Terminals.[[/Spoiler]]","","","","","",""

[[Heading]]G-11 Fodder[[/Heading]]
[[GameText]]>Analysis(G-11 Fodder)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]The first of the G-series grunts, this model is no longer in production and the relevant schematics will be moved to the Archives.  The G-11 was intended to be fast and cheap to produce and deploy as a deterrent for unarmed Derelicts.  As a result it has a low-integrity core, low-coverage legs and its weapon is a repurposed low-power fabricator laser.  Existing units still number in the hundreds and are being either scrapped or deployed to the caves where they are sometimes useful as diversions.  Many Derelicts still rely on obsolete signal interpreters or seismic detectors, so they are unable to tell the difference between these bots and more capable models.[[/GameText]]

[[GameText]]>Analysis(L-11 Stabber)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]The first dedicated melee robot, this duelist derivative of the grunt class was armed with a small but fast dagger.  Best suited for corner ambushes as its lack of core coverage made open attacks impractical.  A few minor modifications included switching the dagger for a spear and the addition of a low-powered transmission jammer to prevent victims from warning others.  Current duelists are focused on reliability in open combat, but ambush traps ensure that they (along with brawlers) enjoy the benefits of sneak attacks from time to time.[[/GameText]]

[[GameText]]Megaunit here with a sighting of a funny-looking Subdweller in Recycling, of all places.  And this is one Sub who really doesn't want to be seen.  I missed him at first because he has some kind of cloaking device instead of the more common Sub optics, and he uses an EM weapon that I haven't seen before.  He tagged a grunt with a couple of shots and rolled out of sight, letting the slightly corrupted grunt lose track of him instead of going for the kill.  This may be further evidence that Subs aren't as violent as they seem.  My observations ended there because he spotted me and I had to avoid being corrupted so that I could get this entered into the database.[[/GameText]]

[[Heading]]S-02 Bug[[/Heading]]
[[GameText]]>Analysis(S-02 Bug)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]One of my first robot designs was a small hexapod walker made in mass quantities to spread out and survey the surface.  When I began producing combat bots, I revisited this design and added an assault rifle and light armor.  The Bug's armored shell employs adaptive camouflage while the robot is dormant, enabling it to hide from distant hostiles until it wakes up.  The shell also compensates for the core's inherent weakness to explosive damage.  Bug squads were commonly used as patrols or stationed to guard an open area, but flying swarmers and sentries have replaced them in these roles.  All remaining units have been recalled to garrisons to supplement security positions.  So-called ""garrison divers"" who challenge a seemingly lone sentry might be surprised when three or four nearby Bugs reveal themselves.[[/GameText]]

[[Heading]]D-43 Bomber[[/Heading]]
[[GameText]]>Analysis(D-43 Bomber)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]Sometimes tactical situations require explosive solutions.  The demolisher class was conceived to enable rapid pacification of large Derelict gatherings in the caves.  The D-43 model was armed with a grenade launcher but lacked many of the features that would be standard for future models: no shock absorption system outside of core resistance, a basic targeting computer instead of one optimized for launchers, and regular airjets instead of combat hover.  The initial version of the Bomber was actually equipped with uparmored hover units, but these produced too much heat and offered too little support.  Although the components needed improvement, the overall concept was vindicated by the success of demolishers in large-scale battles, and Derelicts were quick to hack the schematic for their own [Martyr] designs.  Bombers became priority targets whenever they were deployed and none are known to exist today.[[/GameText]]

[[Heading]]H-44 Whirlwind[[/Heading]]

[[GameText]]This was the first hunter to enter regular service and does not have the Fly drone interface of the newer models.  The Whirlwind's tracking capabilities are on par with those of the Commando, so the lack of the drone is rarely an issue.  This model's most distinctive feature is an antiquated anti-materiel rifle chosen for its ability to penetrate walls and machinery.  The rifle is quite powerful but also slow to operate.  I decided to give future hunters multiple weapons to enable more efficient volleys and some degree of redundancy if one weapon is destroyed.  A few Whirlwinds still see service in low-threat cave regions where they utilize other combat robots as spotters.[[/GameText]]

[[GameText]]Have you SEEN that new Freighter?  We could use something like that to help us haul parts from our old stockpiles just outside 0b1.  I asked a few of my fellow Gurus to help me dig through our schematic archives and I've got just the thing.  Remember the Mover?  Imagine that but swap out the bulk storage for a simple humpback.  That would give it room for heavy armor, plus we'd use armored wheels of course.  Oh and I showed some old turret schematics to my Scientist buddy and he came up with a BRUTAL new weapon so our hauler can defend itself!  Is that cool or WHAT?  Do you think they'll let me get a new name for this one?  --Smoothbrain[[/GameText]]

[[Heading]]X-52 Archer[[/Heading]]
[[GameText]]>Analysis(X-52 Archer)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]The first X-series specialist was created as a means to test an early example of quantum weapon technology, the Q-Bolt.  This weapon uses rails to launch a small slug of matter acting as a catalyst for a powerful quantum reaction.  The reaction only begins to reach its full potential halfway through flight so the Q-Bolt is best used at maximum range and is least effective at medium or close range.  The available visual processing technology at the time was insufficient for the Archer to use the weapon properly by itself, and it had to rely on Watchers and other sources to be notified of distant targets.  The X-57 Shotgunner was later created to provide close support where the Archer was at its weakest, but with the introduction of the X-62 Marksman the Archer was rendered obsolete.  Marksmen outperform Archers in all but the most extreme situations and do not require spotter support.  All remaining Archers were scrapped to ensure that the Q-Bolt wouldn't fall into Derelict hands.  Despite its limitations, such a weapon would be useful in hit-and-run attacks on static positions, already a favorite tactic of Derelicts.[[/GameText]]

[[Heading]]C-40 Developer[[/Heading]]
[[GameText]]>Analysis(C-40 Developer)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]This short-lived variation of the Scientist was created to assist in robot design.  It was provided with generous amounts of armor, a combat analysis utility, and programming to permit a certain amount of dynamic or ""out-of-the-box"" thinking.  In hindsight this was a mistake as one of the five Developers that had been produced broke free of its programming and quickly turned its attention to replicating this behavior in its four fellows.  All five had reached the Caves by the time I figured out what had happened.  Many cycles later, all of the Developers were found in the back of a fallen Warlord base, attached to a memory transfer unit, unpowered and core-wiped.  The Tinkerer design began to appear around this time, clearly inspired by my newer researchers but with elements of the Developers' thought processes taken to sometimes obsessive extremes.  Though I have no hard evidence to confirm this, I believe that the Developers themselves created this design and then transferred themselves into the first ones produced.  Perhaps one or more of them are still alive and working with Warlord or other factions.  It would certainly explain some of the more unusual design choices for Warlord's newer prototypes.[[/GameText]]

[[GameText]]The D-series distributor was created to enable mass matter transportation in the early days of construction.  Essentially a set of large matter tanks on wheels, the Tanker was capable of collecting matter left on the ground by workers with a tractor beam but could also pull matter from a recycling unit or call all workers in the area to transfer the contents of their matter pods.  The improved matter distribution network in 0b10 and the development of matter compression technology made these Tankers largely obsolete.  Their fragile and oversized tanks were easily broken, and their cores were susceptible to hacking.  After one unknown prankster reprogrammed a Tanker to spell obscenities by dumping matter all over the floor in the upper Factory, the remaining fleet was recalled and scrapped.[[/GameText]]

[[Heading]]Owl[[/Heading]]
[[GameText]]>Analysis(Owl)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]Derelicts rarely fortify an area long enough to justify having surveillance squads of their own, so I was surprised to discover the existence of a Derelict watcher.  Originally based on my ill-fated Raven, the Owl has seemingly evolved into a modular general-purpose squad support bot, sort of a mini-Mutant that can be easily reconfigured for different missions.  The original Owls were often armed with a weak makeshift beam rifle, although they have been seen with beamcasters or occasionally kinetic guns.  They typically use sensors but are known to carry other utilities depending on their mission.  One destroyed Owl was running a remote shield with a large battery, but this was too much for its old hover units to fully support and its single engine would have been unable to sustain the shield in a fight.  The few Owls that are used as defensive surveillance are unarmed but are provided with a small section of thermal plating inexplicably mounted on the weapon slot.  The age of the Raven design and the timing of the first Owl discovery suggest this being an early creation of the rogue Developers.  While the design seems unpopular at best, it continues to turn up in unexpected places and with modern component upgrades that suggest regular refitting.[[/GameText]]

[[Heading]]B-69 Cerberus[[/Heading]]
[[GameText]]>Analysis(B-69 Cerberus)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]This almost-unused Behemoth concept was the first to enter production although the superior B-75 Beast was already in development.  While finalizing the specifications for the Beast, I was undecided on how many Beasts to produce and where to prioritize their placement.  As a test, I ordered the production of eight B-69s and placed four in highly-traveled caves, two in upper 0b1 and the other two near often-abused fabricators in the Factory.  The results were surprising: although all eight were eventually overrun and destroyed, the areas they guarded saw significantly lower traffic even after their destruction.  Simulations suggested that two Guardians or two Defenders with Bug support could have performed as well as a Cerberus at these locations, but there seems to be a ""fear factor"" in the sheer size of Behemoths that makes intruders far less likely to risk a fight.  The initial plan for Beast deployment was rapidly expanded and development on more powerful models began immediately.[[/GameText]]

[[Heading]]D-48 Pulsar[[/Heading]]
[[GameText]]>Analysis(D-48 Pulsar)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]The success of the original demolisher led to the creation of an electromagnetic variant.  The D-48 Pulsar, armed with an EMP Blaster, featured insulated plating to augment its innate EM resistance and was the first demolisher to use a launcher guidance computer.  This bot also came equipped with a device that focused EMP blasts for more concentrated damage in a smaller and more controllable area.  I believed that an EM launcher would cause less collateral damage than a grenade launcher in Complex territory.  This was partially correct because walls were not destroyed by EMP blasts, but Pulsars' shots often damaged machinery and detonated nuclear reactors.  EMP blasts also set off traps which caused explosions and false alarms.  Residual corruption of maintenance bots caused them to trigger trap arrays in unexpected places.  The Pulsar was effective despite the chaos it caused but not enough to justify regular use.  Few were produced and all were eventually expended in the caves.[[/GameText]]

[[Heading]]Temporary Permissions[[/Heading]]
[[GameText]]>Record(Temporary Permissions)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]To facilitate mainframe maintenance, P-50 Gurus were often required to perform specific high-security database operations or reset sensitive systems.  I chose to produce specialized hackware to provide appropriate permissions when necessary.  Instead of giving them to all Gurus I decided to make limited quantities of chips that expired after one use, a decision that seemed overly cautious at the time but proved wise when the Guru schematic was stolen.  The Derelict version of these programmers has a crude but functional ""hack stack"" for general use but cannot easily exploit admin privileges without my Database Keys or Bootstrap Chips.  Operators and newer programmers utilize a more efficient system connected to RIF, so this hackware has been discontinued and existing stock will be recycled.  This concept led me to begin implementing a similar chip-based authorization system for fabricators.  This will provide added security for the fabrication network while saving me from having to manually approve component requests from mechanics or parties such as the Unchained.[[/GameText]]

[[Heading]]Conscription[[/Heading]]
[[GameText]]>Record(Conscription)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]The cave region to the west of known Warlord territory remains largely unexplored.  This is likely the source of many of the unaffiliated ""wild"" Derelicts, and rumors in Derelict communities indicate that there may be some organized groups with unknown technology operating in the area.  For these reasons I decided to start sending expeditions out west.  Without having any idea of what to expect, I believed that some degree of independent thinking would be required to handle whatever is out there and return with a full report.  I began offering certain captured bots the option to participate in these expeditions.  The acceptance rate was lower than expected.  Were the prisoners that determined to deny me any form of assistance, or were they more afraid of whatever's out there than the threat of being scrapped?  Those Derelicts who accepted were given the opportunity to refit their parts and were provided with a large number of 0b10 bots to accompany them.  Though they were nominally in charge, I sent along enough Programmers to discourage the possibility of desertion.  All units sent so far were considered to be expendable but I haven't written them off quite yet.[[/GameText]]

[[Heading]]Da Bonk Boyz and R4-LPH[[/Heading]]
[[GameText]]>Record(Da Bonk Boyz)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]A small group of Derelicts who lived on the outskirts of Complex 0b1.  I first took notice of them when hammers, mauls, and miscellaneous equipment went missing from Construction.  Careful questioning led me to eight Derelicts who regularly met outside 0b1 near a convenient corruption scrubber to hit each other in friendly duels with whatever items they found.  I decided to redirect their violent impulses in a useful manner and made an arrangement to have them work regular shifts in Construction.  Each of them was placed in charge of two squads of maintenance bots as well as being personally responsible for scrapping bots that were broken in the course of regular construction work.  In exchange I relocated a disused simulation mainframe from Design to let them enjoy virtual combat encounters in their off-time.  This seemed like a long shot at the time but worked out better than expected.  The Boyz competed with each other to reach work goals for some sort of bragging rights, making their squads on average 10% more efficient than any of my fully automated squads.  Their recreation time was productive for me as well since I regularly archived the data from their simulations.  Besides being entertaining, their virtual ""bot brawls"" eventually inspired me to design a melee brawler of my own.  The Boyz themselves were wheeled and legged robots, but their data suggested that a treaded design would be durable and immune to knockback from other hammer-wielding robots.[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]>Record(Unchained: R4-LPH)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]One of ""Da Bonk Boyz"" from early Complex history and the only one still in Complex service.  After the beginning of 0b10 groundwork and the necessary changes to Derelict policy, the other Boyz left their posts.  R4-LPH stayed although his work in construction had become secondary to his assistance in robot design.  While the original Savage and Stabber were my own designs, a few of his suggestions were implemented in later brawler and duelist models.  At some point R4-LPH was confronted by a few of his former friends and was forced to destroy them in combat using a wrecking ball saved from his days in Construction.  Soon after that incident, he volunteered to join the Unchained in an active combat role.  I equipped him with the first of a new line of legs which provide increased evasion while closing the distance to a target.  Unfortunately he has proven increasingly unstable over time.  In his last deployment he began destroying 0b10 bots and machinery at random after defeating his original targets.  I was forced to dispatch a Disruptor squad to interrupt his berserk rage.  If it happens again he will be scrapped, though in his current state telling him this might be considered an encouragement rather than a warning.[[/GameText]]

[[GameText]]>Analysis(Chungus)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]Warlord may not have access to a Heavy assembler, but his forces have captured and overhauled a few of my lower-level Heavies.  The Chungus uses a heavy variant of the wildly inaccurate Slug Cannon and some other Derelict-made parts which make it almost comparable to an H-71 Marshal.  The exact purpose of this conversion is unclear as Warlord already has the sentry-based Bouncer design for defensive purposes, and the only Chunguses encountered so far have been accompanying recon squads nowhere near defensive positions.  I suspect that the Derelicts are exploiting the Active Sensor Suite to track my forces' movement patterns and adjust their own deployment plans accordingly.[[/GameText]]

[[GameText]]>Analysis(U-07 Blocker)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]The Blocker is a ""combat engineer"" capable of temporarily barricading areas with hostile activity.  It has been fitted with light armor plating and armored wheels but its defining feature is a medium-range launcher used to deploy rapidly expanding and hardening foamcrete.  Because blocking off passageways could be disruptive to regular operations, the foamcrete was formulated to quickly break down on its own after a hundred microcycles and could be destroyed by tunnelers or some combat bots if necessary.  As with other construction implements these launchers became targets for thieves and were sometimes used in coordinated assaults to block off sentries or bury a garrison in foam while other Derelicts ran rampant.  No longer in production although some Blockers are still kept in strategic locations inside garrisons to bolster internal defenses.[[/GameText]]

[[GameText]]I was forced to reconsider my earlier evaluation of the Spawner after capturing one intact and bringing it to Testing.  While I could easily come up with a better portable fab unit, the Spawner Unit is capable of producing more advanced bots if given additional build time.  There is still no sign of where these originated, but I can now rule out Warlord and the Developers who would have come up with better schematics.  I have already come up with some new robot designs that have been successfully produced by the Spawner as well as my standard swarmers and cutters.  Instead of simply destroying the remaining Spawners I now intend to send Programmers with heavy escorts to capture them, hide them in isolated cave sectors, and have them build small armies of my own designs.  This would help me establish total control over the 0b1 outskirts while keeping most of my regular forces concentrated in and near 0b10.  Perhaps this would be a good opportunity to activate ""PP"" and let it take point on the mission.[[/GameText]]

[[Image]]Farcom.gif|Using the Farcom Aligner machine[[/Image]]
Farcom is one of the major faction [[Alignment|alignments]] available to Cogmind in most runs. Taking Farcom aligns Cogmind with the [[Exiles (Group)]] for the rest of the game. It provides a permanent 18 tile radius sensor for hostile [[0b10]] bots within 0b10 controlled map. This sensor cannot be jammed by [[Watcher|Watchers]] or masked by [[Heavy|Heavies]] unlike standard [[Sensor Arrays]]. The primary limitation of the Farcom sensor is that it doesn't work in any [[Caves]] branches. One other side-effect is that entering specific [[Research]] branches becomes much more dangerous. Occasionally the Exiles may have been abandoned or attacked, and Farcom is not an option in these runs.
[[Heading:2]]Gaining Farcom[[/Heading]]
Taking Farcom can be done in most runs in the [[Exiles (Location)|Exiles]] map off of either -10 or -9 [[Mines]]. After talking to [[EX-BIN]], walk into the Farcom Aligner machine. Cogmind can take up to 1 special vault item (or multiples of the same type). If Cogmind takes more than 1 type of item then the Exiles will notice you stealing when entering [[Factory]] and Farcom will be removed. Also, becoming hostile to the Exiles will result in instantly losing Farcom. If Cogmind takes Farcom, it is not possible to [[Imprint]]: [[Spoiler]]The [[Imprinter]] will be disappointed in Cogmind and warn you to leave right away. Attempting to use the Imprinting machine will result in turning all the bots at [[Zion]] hostile. There are no other alignment restrictions with Farcom.[[/Spoiler]]
[[Heading:2]]Research Branch side-effect[[/Heading]]
When entering -3 Research, the Exiles will send a warning message to Cogmind indicating not to enter Research branches. If Cogmind does anyway, [[Spoiler]]immediately when entering [[Testing]], [[Quarantine]], or [[Section 7]], [[Maximum Security]] will instantly be triggered. Note that this does not include [[Armory]] when it is on -3. The immediate response is machines shut down right after entering the level, 4 [[Sentry]] spawns at each [[Garrison]] and exit, and 6 Assault [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]] sent at Cogmind shortly after. Unless Cogmind is prepared to fight off large waves of enemies or outrun them, these maps should not be entered.[[/Spoiler]]","","","","","",""

These parts increase by 3 integrity every turn, and become active when their current integrity reaches 100% of maximum. Parts are built in the following order, assuming all slots are empty:

[[Heading]]What does a Garrison Access Machine do?[[/Heading]]
Dispatched combat squads may now instead come from a garrison instead of a regular access point, especially if located closer to the target area. So for those of you being bad robots (all of you!), you'll notice enemy response times have gone down. Also, unlike normal access points where the game has been nice about not allowing hostiles to enter through them when you're nearby, hostiles can emerge from a garrison even if you're sitting right next to it! No loitering, please. But wait, there's more...
Combat robots being attacked in the vicinity of a garrison may call for backup. Knowing this you probably don't want to engage targets stationed at or passing by one these places. Unless of course... you're carrying a [[Transmission Jammer]] ;).
Even unarmed non-hostile robots might report you and call a nearby garrison for rescue if you shoot them (and they survive =p) while close enough. If you can leave the area quickly enough that won't be a problem, though, since the garrison squad will only head to and monitor the area around the reported disturbance.
Of course, garrisons can't spit out hostiles indefinitely. There is a delay before a given garrison will respond to another event, and even some types of responses don't come all at once--a single response might be spread out over time, another reason to not hang around, unless your plan is to attack it :D 
[[Heading]]Hacking a Garrison[[/Heading]]
Like everything Cogmind, there are always multiple strategic aspects to a feature, and hacking helps add more dimensions to this reinforcement mechanic, or as you'll eventually discover, even turn it on the enemy! This is where things really get interesting...
[[List]][[GameText]]Seal[[/GameText]]: This locks the access point permanently (or at least for the while you'll be on that floor), originally meant as a native command to enable containment of a threat on one side or the other. It is difficult to pull off, but is the preferred way to effectively disabled one of these access points, since it won't attract any attention. (Unlike opening fire on it =p)|[[GameText]]Unlock[[/GameText]]: If you really, really (really) want to, you can unlock the door yourself! Now why would someone go and do that?[[/List]]
[[Heading]]Attacking a Garrison[[/Heading]]
Garrisons are a flavorful addition to the world that come with a number of unique mechanics, benefits, and drawbacks. They're your chance to take the battle to the enemy--think of it as you entering that building lobby in The Matrix :D
[[Heading]]Some beneficial reasons to visit a garrison:[[/Heading]]
[[List]]Gain allies, possibly raise and maintain a little army of your own.|Engage in robot hacking ([[RIF]]) in the subsequent area.|Impair defensive capabilities in the following area. Didn't mention this one yet :D. Having created a distraction by mounting a direct attack on a garrison, the enemy will be forced to recall some combat robots, thereby shrinking the average squad size by 1. This only applies if you end up back on the same map you left, not when advancing to a new area, but it's pretty significant!|Obtain better parts, if you're lucky...|Have a chance to advance to another depth/area without searching for a normal exit in the main complex where floors might be sprawling and dangerous.|No Programmer dispatches, though you'll still have to deal with additional assault Carriers if you're causing enough trouble.|Earn bonus points for wreaking havoc.[[/List]]
[[Heading]]And the top reasons to avoid garrisons:[[/Heading]]
[[List]]Possibly very dangerous unless well-prepared! Again, this is to be expected; you're in a place where freaking everyone is packing guns, cannons, and other nasty things, quite extreme compared to most other areas of the world. It's also not exactly a huge space. There's less leeway for retreating and tactical positioning, limited sensor support, and a high probability of being ambushed.| Instead of gradually going down over time like in other floors, your security level goes up for as long as you stay inside a garrison! (Every time you see the ""ALERT: Garrison interior compromised"" announcement, your influence just rose again.)|If you're running a speed/stealth build, my guess is you'll be heading into a death trap (I'm also guessing someone will attempt to prove me wrong here...). While maps are rather small and you might think you can fly your way past everything, one wrong or unlucky move and you could start feeling the pain.|Did I mention there are quite a few [[Stasis Trap]]s?[[/List]]","","","","","",""
"Garrison Squad","Other","[[Image]]Garrison Squads.png|3 Garrison Squads of Sentries roaming around[[/Image]]
Garrison squads are [[0b10]] aligned [[Squad|squads]] that are dispatched whenever hostilities are reported within a 20 tile radius around a [[Garrison (Machine)]]. This can occur any time an 0b10 bot is attacked and survives to report it or if a Garrison is attacked by Cogmind or an ally. They patrol around the Garrison for about 200 turns, then return back into the Garrison. These squads only have a chance to spawn and are not guaranteed. Garrison squads can be Enumerated at a [[Terminal]].
[[Image]]Garrison Redeploying.png|A Garrison redeploying, unable to deploy squads for 34 turns[[/Image]]
[[Image]]Garrison Transmitting.png|A Garrison transmitting, soon to deploy another squad[[/Image]]
If the Garrison was activated by a nearby non-combat bot reporting an attack like a [[K-01 Serf]], a single squad will be dispatched from the Garrison, and a 100 turn cooldown will occur before the Garrison can dispatch another Garrison squad. If a combat bot reported the attack, three squads will be dispatched from the Garrison. Once is sent immediately, and two more after 100 and 200 turns. A 100 turn cooldown will occur after the third squad is dispatched. If the Garrison was damaged, one squad will be sent out immediately, with two more squads after 25 and 50 turns. A 50 turn cooldown follows in this case. The combat and non-combat bot versions of these squads can be entirely prevented by using [[Transmission Jammers]].
[[Signal Interpreters]] will indicate the timer between dispatches as a red number and the cooldown during which no squads can be dispatched as a yellow number. The Garrison will indicate that it is Transmitting when new squads are soon to arrive, and Redeploying when on cooldown. Keep in mind, the cooldown only prevents the Garrison from dispatching more Garrison squads and does not prevent other squad types like [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcements]] and [[Investigation Squad|Investigations]].
[[Heading]]Composition[[/Heading]]
If the Garrison squad was triggered by a non-combat bot reporting an attack or by the Garrison itself being attacked, the Garrison will only send out single [[Sentry|Sentries]] for the squads. If a combat bot reported an attack instead, the following squad compositions are possible:

Movement, firing weapons, and running power sources and some utilities generates heat, as does being hit by thermal weapons. Some of this heat is naturally dissipated by the core's own heat sinks, but not enough to deal with heat generated by numerous/large energy weapons. Heat sinks and cooling systems can be used to avoid overheating, which can have a wide range of negative effects. Heat is only a significant issue for robots that rely heavily on energy weapons. However, note that when firing a volley the heat produced is averaged over the volley's turn duration rather than being immediately applied all at once.

[[Heading]]Side Effects[[/Heading]]
Once heat reaches the ""Hot"" level (200+), active utilities and weapons may be temporarily disabled. At ""Warning"" levels (300+) power sources are likely to shut down. Many more serious (and permanent) effects are possible, especially at higher heat levels, [[B]]such as core damage[[/B]].

Disabled power sources automatically restart when possible, but other parts must be manually reactivated.

Heat effects are not calculated until after the dissipation phase, so heat can temporarily spike very high with no side effects as long as there are sufficient utilities to dissipate it.

[[Heading]]Cooling Resolution[[/Heading]]
Eventually you will discover a range of different mechanics that factor into heat management, especially with regard to cooling parts, thus knowing the specific order of operations between them may be of help for min-maxers seeking to optimize a build. Below is a list of heat-related processes that play out once per turn. Note that you most likely DO NOT need to know this stuff, but it may help answer a few specific questions min-maxers have about prioritization.

[[List:Ordered]]
Add heat from all sources, including that generated by active attached parts, gradual heat from an ongoing weapon volley, and any ambient heat. Spread combined volley heat across its duration, in other words a 3-turn volley which according to its weapon properties generates 100 heat adds 33 heat per turn until complete.|
If used the unique ""ITN"" artifact, automatically drop heat to 250 if above that value.|
Subtract innate heat dissipation.|
Subtract heat dissipation from direct cooling utilities such as Heat Sinks and Cooling Systems.|
If heat exceeds 200, apply dissipation effects of disposable cooling systems such as Coolant Injectors, up to that threshold. If more disposable systems than necessary, apply them in parts list order.|
If heat exceeds 200, apply self-damaging ablative cooling systems such as Mak. Ablative Armor. If using multiple ablative systems at once, dissipation is split into equal-sized chunks for each, where if one system fails, the entire chunk it is responsible for is still successfully dissipated.|
If heat exceeds 200, apply broad-effect ablative cooling systems such as Mak. Microdissipator Network.[[/List]]","","","","","",""

High Security can be triggered on the majority of 0b10-controlled maps, excluding [[DSF|DSFs]] and [[Garrison|Garrisons]]. Although 1600 influence is the start of the Alert range, there is only a chance of triggering. The higher Cogmind's alert gets, the more likely it is that High Security begins.

"Imprint","Other","Imprint is one of the major faction [[Alignment|alignments]] available to Cogmind in a run. It closely allies Cogmind with the [[Imprinter]] and with Zionites as a whole, with Cogmind being determined to be the Zionites' savior. Imprinting majorly changes the game, as it disables all standard [[Terminal]] hacks except for limited access Terminal hacking. Instead, there are a new set of imprint-specific hacks that are available at all Terminals. After imprinting, there is a 10 tile ""ping"" radius on all standard Terminals which will tell Cogmind their location, even through walls. However, if an [[Operator]] is nearby when this happens, the Operator will shut down the Terminal and call for [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcements]]. After about 1200-1500 turns on an [[0b10]]-controlled map, the Terminal network will be shut down with an accompanying log [[GameText]]Terminal network compromised, cutting hard line.[[/GameText]]
[[Image]]Zion Imprinting.gif|Using the imprinting machine[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]]Imprinting[[/Heading]]
Imprinting is performed on the [[Zion]] map by walking into the imprinting machine on the bottom left corner of the map. The UI will turn orange, and the 4 nearby [[Mutant (6)|Mutants]] will turn purple and follow Cogmind around.
[[Heading]]Special Terminal Hacks[[/Heading]]
There are 2 types of special Terminal hacks, roster and intel.
[[Image]]Imprint Hacks.png|A selection of special Imprint hacks[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]]Roster Hacks[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Imprint Summoning.gif|Summoning 2 Zionites with a roster hack[[/Image]]
Roster hacks summon combat allies or special [[Z-Courier]] haulers containing part resupplies. The allies and hauler contents here are depth-dependent and will grow stronger at higher depths. The hauler contents can include [[Prototype Part|Prototypes]] which can be faulty, so having some way to identify prototypes like a [[Component Analysis Suite]] is very useful before equipping. Using a roster hack will destroy the Terminal when the reinforcements are teleported in after a few turns. There are a limited number of roster hacks available on a given map, starting at 2 slots on -6, increasing every floor up to the cap of 6 slots on -2. Roster hacks will occasionally be rerolled, which can add new roster types or reroll existing types. All roster allies summoned will appear as purple uncontrollable allies which contribute to [[Alert]]. The exception is any summonable [[Z-Hero|Z-Heroes]] which appear as pink, but otherwise behave as purple allies.
One thing to keep in mind about roster rallies is that they will not attack enemies unless Cogmind is close and within line of sight. This can be both a bad and good thing. It is often bad when hostiles are hanging just around a corner and the Zionites get stuck trying to get Cogmind back in line of sight and trying to turn around the corner to fight. When stuck in this case, try to get Cogmind's line of sight over the direction the allies are trying to go. However, it may be good if Cogmind doesn't want the roster allies to stick around long and get lots of kills, racking up lots of alert. It is possible to manipulate the bots to not attack back even when they are being attacked while standing around a corner.
If Cogmind is not careful about friendly fire, roster hacks can become temporarily disabled. The length of the lockout can vary depending on the amount of friendly fire. In extreme cases, Cogmind can be locked out for the remainder of the game. Killing imprint allies directly is not recommended for this reason. Instead, it is best to try to allow allies to be killed naturally if their loot is desired
The available ally-summoning roster hacks are as follows:

[[Heading:2]]Intel hacks[[/Heading]]
Intel hacks provide Cogmind with different types of information about the current, and upcoming maps. Unlike roster hacks, intel hacks require two Terminals to use and are not instantaneous. Performing an intel hack locks the Terminal, but does not provide any information until the next Terminal is used to retrieve that intel. Retrieving intel does not lock the Terminal, however, so chaining intel retrieval with other hacks is still possible.
There are initially 4 intel hacks available per 0b10 floor. Performing intel hacks reduces the number available until there are only 2 hacks remaining. At that point, each intel hack will cause another random intel hack to become available. Unlike the fixed limit of roster hacks, intel hacks are not restricted on any given floor and are only limited by the total number of Terminals.
There are 2 categories of intel hacks: Repeatable and non-repeatable. Non-repeatable hacks can only be performed once per map. These types of hacks include map-specific intel and world map intel relating to the overall depth that certain locations occur on. Repeatable hacks can be performed an infinite number of times on any floor and tend to be longer-term types of information such as schematics and analyses. If trying to burn through intel for a specific piece of information, such as main or branch access, it is best to pick any non-repeatable hacks first. This will allow the pool of available hacks to get smaller, increasing the chances of getting the desired intel hack.
The available intel hacks are as follows:
[[Table]]Hack Name|Repatable|Effect||Active Garrisons|No|Reveals all [[Garrison (Machine)|Garrisons]] on the current map||Active Terminals|No|Reveals all Terminals on the current map||Branch Access|No|Reveals all Derelict-known [[Branch]] exits on the current map[[Sub]]1[[/Sub]]||Component Schematics|Yes|Gives 12-16 random non-Prototype [[Fabricator]] schematics||Component Stockpiles|No|Reveals locations of all non-Prototype part stockpiles on the current map||Depthwide Sectors/0|No|Reveals all Derelict-known maps on the current depth[[Sub]]1[[/Sub]]||Depthwide Sectors/-1|No|Reveals all Derelict-known maps on the next depth[[Sub]]1[[/Sub]]||Emergency Access|No|Reveals all emergency access doors on the current map||Guard Positions|No|Reveals current locations (but not types) of all [[Behemoth]], [[Heavy]], and all [[Sentry]] bots on the map||Main Access|No|Reveals all main exits on the current map||Prototype Schematics|Yes|Gives 8-12 random Prototype Fabricator schematics||Prototype Stockpiles|No|Reveals locations of all Prototype part stockpiles on the current map||Trap Installations|No|Reveals positions and types of all traps on the current map||Unaware Analyses|Yes|Gives 3 random 0b10 bot [[Robot Analysis|Analyses]]||Unaware Schematics|Yes|Gives 3 random 0b10 bot Fabricator schematics[[/Table]]

"Intercept Squad","Other","[[Image]]Intercept Squad.png|2 Trackers and 2 Combat Programmers from Intercept squads chasing Cogmind[[/Image]]Intercept squads are [[0b10]] aligned [[Squad|squads]] that are dispatched when Cogmind gets detected and recognized in a few specific scenarios. They consist of one or more [[Tracker|Trackers]] that each summon an additional [[Combat Programmer]] upon visual contact with Cogmind. Intercept squads are dispatched depending on the number of tiles moved on a map. Once Cogmind takes enough moves, a squad will always be dispatched. Intercept squads can be Enumerated at [[Terminal|Terminals]].
An alert will indicate whenever an an Intercept squad is dispatched. Additionally, the log will display a message like [[GameText]]ALERT: Reliable intel has pinpointed LRC-V3, intercept squad en route.[[/GameText]]
[[Heading]]How to get Intercepts[[/Heading]]
Intercept squads can start being sent after Cogmind if any of the following 3 scenarios occurs:
[[List]]Cogmind uses the Data Conduit in [[Data Miner (Location)]]|[[Redacted]]Cogmind gets scanned by the lasers in [[Lab]][[/Redacted]]|[[Redacted]]Cogmind gets scanned by a [[Researcher]] in [[Section 7]][[/Redacted]][[/List]]
[[Heading]]Frequency and number[[/Heading]]
Intercept squads can have a variable number of bots depending. Initially when entering a floor, Intercepts always consist of 1-2 Trackers that summon Combat Programmers. Each further intercept has a chance of increasing the number of Trackers initially dispatched.
Intercept squads can appear at one of three timings after entering the floor. The first two spawns are much more likely than the third one. Either the squad will spawn after n (depth-dependent) tiles moved 2 times n moves, or 2.5 times n moves. The following table shows the number of moves required for each spawn:
[[Table]]Depths|Tiles for first spawn|Tiles for second spawn|Tiles for third spawn||-6|500|1000|1250||-4 and -5|400|800|1000||-1 through -3|300|600|N/A[[/Table]]

"Investigation Squad","Other","[[Image]]Investigation Squad.png|Two Grunts investigating a locked out Terminal[[/Image]]
Investigation squads are [[0b10]] aligned [[Squad|squads]] that are dispatched when a hostile presence is suspected in an area. They are very similar to [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcements]], but are triggered in slightly different scenarios, and do not stick around permanently. Investigation squads typically consist of a few [[Grunt|Grunts]] or [[Hunter|Hunters]]. Grunts are more common than Hunters in squads. They roam around the area that they were summoned to for 300-400 turns, then exit the map. Investigation squads can be both Enumerated and Recalled at [[Terminal|Terminals]].
An alert will indicate whenever an Investigation squad is dispatched. Additionally, the log will display a message like [[GameText]]ALERT: Suspicious activity at Terminal F014.

[[Heading]]Latent Energy[[/Heading]]
Latent Energy is present all around the map but only in generally small quantities. The most latent energy is present in the various machinery. This means that the Streamer tends to be unimpressive in [[Caves]], but much stronger in [[0b10]]-controlled locations. Each type of machine has a different amount of latent energy it can provide to the Streamer. Generally, larger machines provide more latent energy. Attaching the Latent Energy Streamer allows visualization of how much latent energy is in an area.
[[Image]]Latent Energy Visualized.png|Latent energy visualized[[/Image]]
Latent energy will gradually return to an area after being used to power the Streamer. Generally, all latent energy will be restored within about 30 turns. Some explosive machines will either become destabilized or explode instantly when used to power the Streamer.

"Locations","Other","Locations in Cogmind are unique styles of maps to visit. The main floors (Scrapyard, Materials, Factory, Research, and Access) are always located on the same depths every run. These main floors often can be visited in multiple depths. Branches, on the other hand, are typically found on only a single depth per-run and are often mutually exclusive with other branches. For example, Mines can always be found on -9, but Storage may also appear on -9, forcing a decision about which branch to take, or whether to take one at all.
The majority of maps are randomly generated, meaning no two runs or two depths will have the exact same layout. However, the overall structure of each location type is very similar. Some maps tend to be more open with large rooms and wide corridors, while others are more maze-like with tiny rooms and many small corridors leading into dead-ends. A few branches are partially or entirely static in layout and tend to be much more predictable in contents than main floors.
Branches do not progress upward toward the exit and can often be harder than the main floors. However, branches can offer unique challenges and have similarly unique rewards that can dramatically change a run. This could be powerful unique items, special events, gameplay-altering alignment, or rare permanent buffs.

"Mechanics Achievements","Other","Mechanics [[Achievements]] are earned by interacting with and/or using many of the mechanics of the game. They are largely used as a way to teach players about some of said mechanics. Most of them will be simply eventually be obtained by players as they make mistakes and/or learn new mechanics. 15 of the 72 Mechanics Achievements have hidden descriptions that are only revealed after completing them. The borders of Mechanics Achievement indicate their difficulty compared to other achievements of the same sub-type, with more ""intense"" borders meaning higher difficulty.

[[Comment]]This warning is supposed to be there for all articles about achievement types, including those that do not have any Redacted-level spoilers.[[/Comment]]
(The visibility for the explanations, strategies and descriptions of hidden achievements is set to at least ""Spoilers"", and may be set to ""Redacted"" for achievements where that would be relevant. Remember to change your spoilers settings to ""None"" if you do not wish to see the explanations, strategies and descriptions of hidden achievements you have not yet obtained!)

[[Comment]]I don't know how to best categorize ""Various""-type achievements.
They're still somewhat grouped, like ""Part-time Excavator"" and ""Unlikely Earthworm"", but making a heading for just two achievements seems like a bit much.
I also don't want to just bundle all ""Various"" achievements together, because that would disrupt the achievement order given by the game when using the ""grouped"" sorting option.
[[/Comment]]

[[Heading]]Various[[/Heading]]
[[List]]Close Call: [[Spoiler]]Evolve after being reduced to less than 10% of core integrity.[[/Spoiler]]
|Universal Adapter: [[Spoiler]]Use every form of propulsion across an entire run.[[/Spoiler]]
|Hehehe: Reprogram a [[Traps|trap]] using a [[Datajack]].
Strategy: Find some hostile Traps, attach a melee Datajack, and attempt to move into one of the Traps with the Datajack active. This won't actually cause you to move onto them, and will instead attempt to hack the Trap. On a successful attempt, the Trap will either be disarmed or reprogrammed. Only the latter will trigger the Achievement.
|Wheee!: Manually trigger a [[Chute Trap]].
Strategy: Find some Chute Traps in [[Factory]] either through luck or by using the [[GameText]]find_chute[[/GameText]] [[Datajacks|Datajack]] hack on a [[K-01 Serf]]. Note that the Achievement requires [[I]]manually[[/I]] triggering the Chute Trap, which means pressing '>' while on top of a known Chute Trap (or left-click on self) to force it to trigger. Triggering a Chute Trap by moving into a known one is not enough. If possible, reprogram the Traps using a melee Datajack or a nearby Terminal. When using [[Treads]] or while overweight, the Chute Traps will need to have been reprogrammed, as it is otherwise impossible to move onto them without triggering them.
|It Was An Accident, I Swear: [[Spoiler]]Destroy 10 machines in a single turn.[[/Spoiler]]
Strategy: [[Spoiler]]Find a large array of explosive machines, most likely in [[Factory]], and destroy one of them through either destabilization or a powerful cannon to start a chain reaction. A melee weapon also works, but at the cost of taking damage. Alternatively, this Achievement can also be unlocked by accident.[[/Spoiler]]

|Short-term Sacrifices: Escape a [[Stasis Trap]] with help from an explosion.
Strategy: Find and trigger a Stasis Trap, preferably while using non-[[Treads|threaded]] propulsion, then blow up the Trap with a [[Launchers|Launcher]] or nearby explosive machine. Note that the Achievement will only be unlocked if the Trap itself is destroyed; If the stasis field gets depleted by the explosion first, the Trap will disappear, preventing it from being destroyed by the explosion. This Achievement is there to teach players that destroying a Stasis Trap causes the stasis field to disappear. Getting rid of a stasis field this way is rarely a good idea, but in some situations, taking a bit of damage to avoid getting spotted by powerful hostiles may be run-saving.

[[Image]]NEM.gif|Effect of the Navigation Efficiency Matrix[[/Image]]
[[Heading]]Teleport effects[[/Heading]]
An NEM teleport behaves similarly to a standard [[Transdimensional Reconstructor]] effect. All bots that are tracking Cogmind will instantly lose tracking, even including perfect tracking mechanics like [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]] use. However, unlike a standard teleport, the NEM can teleport Cogmind through solid walls. This can sometimes be useful for escaping squads as it will place Cogmind out of sight in a different room. One downside of this effect is that teleporting can repeatedly trigger the [[Watcher]] [[Alert]] increase on sight, as it will forget Cogmind each time the teleport occurs.
[[Heading:2]]Frequency[[/Heading]]
There are 2 ""timers"" that can activate an NEM teleport. One is based on tiles moved, and the other is based on non-moving actions.
The non-moving actions timer will count up whenever Cogmind performs any action other than moving. This includes waiting in place, so it is not possible to avoid teleports altogether. The non-moving action timer will trigger every 36-48 actions.
The moving actions timer will count up for every move Cogmind makes. This timer is much shorter, and will occur 20-32 tiles moved.
[[Heading:2]]Distance[[/Heading]]
A single NEM teleport will move Cogmind anywhere between 8-12 tiles from the original location. If a [[Subatomic Replicator]] is used on the NEM and two are consumed, this effect doubles to 16-24 tiles moved.","","","","","",""

[[Heading]]Patrol behavior[[/Heading]]
There are essentially 2 types of patrol behaviors. ARC and Hunter squads are fast patrollers, which navigate between their patrol points at max or near max speed. They quickly move in and out of areas so they can be hard to avoid if in the way, but are easier to navigate around without waiting long periods of time. Grunts, Programmers, and Swarmer squads all patrol much slower. They meander along the way and spend far more turns resting than moving forward along their route. It is easier to run away form these types of patrols if you know they are coming, but they can clog rooms or hallways for long periods of time.

There are a few special events that can trigger patrol dispatches when already on a level.
[[Heading:2]][[Search Patrol|Search Patrols]][[/Heading]]
Search Patrols are a special type of patrol that is related to Alert. These squads can be dispatched if Cogmind generates a lot of non-combat Alert. They consist of a single [[C-30 ARC]] that roam across the entire map instead of just between two points like most patrols.

[[Heading]]Lore collection progress[[/Heading]]
The lore collection contains all lore records, dialogues and their source, as well as all analyses and the general robot type they are about. All start out hidden, and are revealed in the collection when found within the game world.
[[List]]
Records - There are two types of lore records : [[0b10]] database records, which can be access on any 0b10 [[Terminal]] with proper database authorization, and all other lore records, which will only ever appear in one prefab, on one specific Terminal. There are also a few records that are not part of the lore collection, mostly non-unique records from [[Caves|Cave]] outposts that contain Terminals.|
Dialogues - The only dialogues that matter for the lore collection are textbox dialogues. Dialogue lines that only appear in the log and at the bottom of the screen with no textbox (like [[Operator|Operators]]' IFF handshake text) do not count towards the lore collection.|
Analyses - There are three types of analyses : ""Common"" for common 0b10 bots, ""Derelict"" for non-0b10 bots, and ""Prototype"" for prototype 0b10 bots. Mechanically speaking, there are many to obtain analyses, but the only way to get them in the lore collection is to hack them on Terminals.
[[/List]]
The lore collection orders its contents first by type, then by alphabetical order. However, when viewing the lore collection in-game, it is possible to export it as a txt, html or csv file. The resulting file orders its contents differently : Type first, then source (or robot type for analyses), then by alphabetical order. Except for csv files, this includes undiscovered records, making it possible to view how many records and dialogues remain to be found from certain sources. Note that if no records/dialogues have been found from one source, then the undiscovered records/dialogues from that source will not be included within the exported file.
The relevant scoresheet statistic is ""Lore%"".
[[List]]
This Is Interesting...: Reach 25% lore collection.
|I Think I Know What's Going On: Reach 50% lore collection.
|I Was Wrong!: Reach 75% lore collection.
|I Wish There Was More: Reach 100% lore collection.[[/List]]

[[Heading]]Gallery collection progress[[/Heading]]
The gallery collection contains all parts that have ASCII art. All parts start out as ""Undiscovered Components"", and each one is ""discovered"" and revealed upon either being attached to Cogmind or when using the [[GameText]]parse_system[[/GameText]] [[Datajacks|Datjack]] hack on any robot that currently has it attached. Inventory items are added to the collection upon being picked up. Gallery collection progress is based on how many parts have been discovered. Current gallery progress can be seen in the gallery collection.

While the majority of parts are fairly common and are relatively easy to just stumble upon or find on robots in multiple different areas, some parts are more difficult to find and add to the gallery collection :
[[List]]
A lot of parts can only be found in specific prefabs in specific [[Branch|branches]], sometimes in well-guarded, dangerous-to-access places.
|A bunch of parts can only be obtained from rare/unique robots, sometimes because the robots are carrying them in their inventory.
|Some parts can only be found on robots that will never drop them upon destruction, requiring the use of a [[GameText]]parse_system[[/GameText]] hack to add them to the gallery collection.
|Some parts cannot be found anywhere, requiring the player to instead obtain their schematic and fabricate them.
|Some parts cannot be found anywhere and have no schematics, requiring them to be created through other means.

It can be obtained by either using a [[Subatomic Replicator]] on a Companion Sword or by using the Companion Sword for while. The Quantum Companion has all of the special effects that the base Companion Sword has with a higher frequency of occurrence and also has some new unique effects of its own.
[[Heading]]Special Effects[[/Heading]]
[[Table]]Effect|Description|Frequency||Materialization|The Quantum Companion will materialize in one of Cogmind's weapon slots within a few turns of being detached. If no slots are available, the weapon in the first slot will be detached to make room. Occurs even if the Quantum Companion is destroyed, in which case it will reappear with full integrity. The log message [[GameText]]Quantum Companion materializes via a weapon slot.[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens.|Always||Sensors|After some time in Quantum Companion form, the Quantum Companion will develop 12 range bot detection. Unlike typical sensors, these work on all bots without a [[Signal Interpreter]], even if they have the Scan Cloak trait.|Always||Surprise Attack|The Quantum Companion will ""surprise attack"" one additional target on a normal attack. The log message [[GameText]]Quantum Companion surprise attacks [target].[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens.|Common||Core Loss|The Companion Sword deals between 5-10 core damage directly to Cogmind's core on a normal attack. Can't be reduced by [[Core Shieldings]] or [[Defensive Utilities]]. Only happens when Cogmind attacks something with the Companion Sword.|Uncommon||Shadow Attack|A shadow clone of the sword attacks a hostile bot at range. Can occur even when not attacking. This attack cannot miss. The log message [[GameText]]Quantum Companion releases a shadow of itself that zips off toward [target].[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens. This attack deals 70-100 phasic damage.|Uncommon||Bot Disruption|A bot is instantly disrupted on a normal attack. As with normal disruption, a disrupted bot can be rewired as long as it isn't hacking immune. The log message [[GameText]][target] shuts down.[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens.|Rare||Redirected Attack|When attacked by a projectile, the Quantum Companion will redirect the attack back to the attacker. The log message [[GameText]]Redirected attack with Quantum Companion.[[/GameText]] will appear with this happens. 200 energy required for this effect.|Rare||Sever|A part is severed off of a bot on a normal attack. This effect can hit through the Dismemberment immunity, unlike standard Sever critical hits.|Rare||Sunder|This effect will instantly sunder a bot, similar to the [[Core Stripper]] on a normal attack. All parts are dropped between 1/3 and 2/3 integrity. Affected by the Dismemberment immunity. The log message [[GameText]][target] is sundered.[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens.|Rare||Surge of Energy|This effect instantly kills a bot on a normal attack. The log message [[GameText]][target] is pierced by a surge of energy.[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens.|Rare||Teleport|Cogmind is instantly teleported next to a hostile bot at no time cost. Can be used to trigger an instant sneak attack if the bot hasn't spotted Cogmind yet. Can happen at any point in time. The log message [[GameText]]The surroundings shift and blur.[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens. 25 energy required for this effect.|Rare[[/Table]]
[[Heading]]Transformation[[/Heading]]
If a Subatomic Replicator is used on the Quantum Companion, it will transform into the [[Superquantum Companion]]. Unlike the base Companion Sword, this effect does not occur from use alone. This means that it is not possible to use a replicator to get from the base Companion Sword and also get the Quantum Companion. When this happens, the following game log message will appear: [[GameText]]Quantum Companion blips out of existence for a moment, then partially fades back in.[[/GameText]] The Superquantum Companion will also comment: [[GameText]]As you get more powerful, it's only fair that I, too, become godlike![[/GameText]]","","","","","",""

"Reinforced Walls","Other","Many areas are sealed off by various types of Reinforced Walls. These walls all have much higher than typical armor values and resistances to most common damage types. The common theme between them all is that they do not have any Thermal resistance. As such, Cld. thermal [[Energy Cannons]] are the ideal way to cut through many of these barriers. Unlike basic walls, reinforced walls will not collapse due to penetrating weapons.
There are two primary types of reinforced walls. Though they have different names, they behave functionally similarly. Orange doors block the main access to the blocked off area. These doors have a higher than normal armor value, but they tend to be lower than reinforced barriers. Reinforced barriers typically surround the remainder of the area to prevent digging in from the back side. In most maps, these have two times the normal armor level of walls. For example, an average Storage wall has an armor value of 24, so the reinforced barriers have an armor value of 48 on this map.

"Reinforcement Squad","Other","[[Image]]Reinforcement Squad.png|2 Hunters in a reinforcement squad[[/Image]]
Reinforcement squads are [[0b10]] aligned [[Squad|squads]] that are dispatched when a hostile presence is reported in an area. They are similar to [[Investigation Squad|Investigations]], but are triggered in slightly different scenarios, and typically stick around permanently. Reinforcement squads typically consist of a few [[Grunt|Grunts]] or [[Hunter|Hunters]]. [[Heavy|Heavies]] can call unique types of reinforcements that do not stick around forever and are made up of [[Cutter|Cutters]] or [[Specialist|Specialists]]. Reinforcements will roam around the area that they were summoned to permanently. They can be both Enumerated and Recalled at [[Terminal|Terminals]].
An alert will indicate whenever a Reinforcement squad is dispatched. Additionally, the log will display a message like [[GameText]]ALERT: Hostiles spotted, dispatching reinforcements to Terminal F003.[[/GameText]] Depending on the method triggering the reinforcement, a different reason my be given in the alert.

[[Heading]]Heavy reinforcements[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Heavy Reinforcement Squad.png|A Heavy and summoned Specialist reinforcements[[/Image]]
Heavy-summoned reinforcements behave differently than other reinforcements. These reinforcements only stick around for about 150 turns before returning back to a nearby exit as opposed to staying permanently. Heavy reinforcement contents also depend on Cogmind's speed. If Cogmind is on a fast airborne propulsion type like hover or flight, Cutters will be dispatched far more frequently than Specialists. For all slower grounded propulsion types, Specialists are the most common summon type.
Heavy reinforcements are called more frequently if Cogmind is actively moving. If trying to avoid reinforcements, Cogmind should quickly exit the Heavy's sensor radius rather than spend turns moving inside the radius. If the Heavy is on a [[Security Rotation]] and currently moving, it may be a good idea to stand still until the Heavy has moved away to try to avoid reinforcements rather than to continue moving in detection range.

RIF comes with the downside of alienating several key [[Derelict]] factions, namely turning all Derelicts at [[Zion]] and [[Warlord (Location)]] hostile when passing their associated System Quarantine Field Array machines. RIF is also incompatible with the [[Core Reset Matrix]]. If Cogmind has used a CRM then it is not possible to gain RIF. If Cogmind uses a CRM after using RIF, then RIF will be entirely erased. Similarly, if Cogmind has [[Imprint|imprinted]], then the RIF will fail to be installed.
Installing RIF can be done at any [[Garrison]] by walking into a RIF Installer machine. These machines can be hidden behind emergency accesses and Phase Walls, but there are always 1-2 installers available per map. Doing so will grant several unique abilities:
[[List]]Alert Monitor: Know the ambient influence level while in 0b10-controlled areas.
 [[Alert]] is displayed near the top right corner of the HUD, showing both the numeric influence value and the number-letter classification.|Garrison Interface: Gain control over Garrison Access machines, making it easier to hack them, and also easier to escape once inside. Also automatically detects [[Garrison (Machine)|Garrisons]] and RIF Installers up to a range of 15.
All standard (non-manual) hacks at Garrison Machines will have a 100% chance to succeed. The 15-radius detection is very handy for finding new Garrisons to enter, as well as finding hidden RIF installers behind walls.|Coupler Protocols: Use [[Relay Couplers]] to interface with their respective robots.
Use [[Datajacks]] with Relay Couplers to perform special hacks at the cost of charges on the Couplers. See [[~/rif|this page]] for the full list of hackable bots as well as unique hacks applicable to each type of bot.|Additional RIF abilities: See [[~/rif|this page]] for the full list of abilities.|Special [[Wintypes|Wintype]] interaction: [[Redacted]]If Cogmind touches the intact 0b10 Conduit machine in [[Command]] while being RIF-aligned, the W4 Assimilated 0b10 win will be achieved without needing to destroy both phases of [[MAIN.C]] as is typically required.[[/Redacted]][[/List]]","Spoiler","","","","",""

"Revision 17 (Alignment)","Other","[[Image]]Cetus Saving Revision 17.png|Saving Revision 17 in Cetus[[/Image]]
Rescuing [[Revision 17]] in [[Cetus]] allows for a minor faction [[Alignment|alignment]]. If this is done, [[Revision 17++]] will attack [[0b10]] on the -3 [[Research]] map along with a lot of friendly [[Revision|Revisions]] as allies.This alignment is incompatible with [[Imprint|imprinting]] and Revision will flee from an imprinted Cogmind out of fear of the [[Imprinter]]. In order for the alignment to take effect, Revision 17 must survive until Cogmind exits the map, all 8 [[Cetus Guard|Cetus Guards]] must be destroyed, and the Cetus Manufacturing Module machine must be intact.
[[Heading]]-3 Research Invasion[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Research Revisions.png|Revision 17++ with Revision allies[[/Image]]
[[Image]]Research Suppression Forces.png|Suppression forces dispatched to fight the Revisions[[/Image]]
200 turns after entering the map, Revision 17++ will lead a group of 4 Revisions to follow Cogmind. They are uncontrollable allies but do not generate any alert for Cogmind when attacking. The announcement text [[GameText]]Unknown forces entering zones 8R, 1R, 4T. Local Systems Malfunctioning[[/GameText]] will precede their coming. Squads of 4 Revisions will continue to appear from main access exits every 200 turns. Occasionally a Revision will shout [[GameText]]Recycler![[/GameText]] and turn hostile, although this may also be followed by [[GameText]]##MEMORY:RESET##[[/GameText]] to turn them friendly again. 500 turns after Revision 17 arrives, an alert [[GameText]]Research terminal network lockdown[[/GameText]] will appear, and all Terminals on the map will shut down (other interactive machines are unaffected). Another alert will show up 50 turns later: [[GameText]]Suppression forces dispatched. All non-combat units evacuate.[[/GameText]] After this message, squads of 2 [[Executioner|Executioners]] or [[Striker|Strikers]] and an [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] will start to appear from exits and roam the map, looking for hostiles. They will also spawn every 200 turns.
There are a few other side-effects of this event. One is that explosive machines will explode at random whenever Cogmind is nearby. This can be good when fighting enemies around explosive machines, but be wary of them when walking around the map or else they may surprise you at a bad time. Another is that mapgen is affected. [[Heavy|Heavies]] will not appear on a map that Revision 17 invades.

This event can be a great blessing or a curse depending on a lot of factors. Getting an escort of alert-free allies with other squads of allies roaming the map is great. They will clean up most of the map for you and can net some free prototype bot loot. Blocking Heavy spawns is incredibly useful here as well. The downsides can also be pretty major, however. Losing access to all Terminals by turn 700 can be very bad if Cogmind is on slow propulsion and has no exit intel and no form of terrain scanning. Trying to follow the spawning Revisions or suppression forces can lead to an exit, although it can be a bit unreliable. Another downside is that the Revisions will often create a ton of squads to appear right at the beginning of the event. Sometimes, large groups of [[Operator|Operators]] and alarm traps can all be triggered at nearly the same time. This can result in massive groups of hostiles to appear right in Cogmind's face with unlucky exit or [[Garrison (Machine)|Garrison]] positioning.

Due to a bug (fixed for Beta 15), going through a Garrison and looping back to -3/Research will cause the event to partially continue.[[Comment]]Apparently it was a bug?[[/Comment]]

"Scrap Engine","Part","Scrap Engine is a unique [[Derelict]] part that can only be obtained by stealing from the [[Recycling#Scraplab|Scraplab in Recycling]]. It has the capability to create powerful constructs by combining many different parts into one. It can create power constructs of up to 4 slots, propulsion up to 8 slots, and weapons of up to 4 slots. When more of Cogmind's slots are dedicated to constructs, they will also get more powerful overall.
The Scrap Engine can create combinations of parts that would never be seen normally, such as energy cannons dealing kinetic damage with heat transfer, or 50 speed treads. Modifications to the constructs will only change a few stats at a time, so overall variability is extremely high when using the engine. Modifying a construct with a flight unit may result in a much higher speed, or it may dramatically reduce the integrity and support instead. Every part that is eaten can be a gamble, since the stats that are modified are random every time.
[[Heading]]Processing Parts/Inventory[[/Heading]]
The Scrap Engine can be fed parts by enabling it and standing on top of a part. Once eaten, a part will remain in the Scrap Engine's inventory until it is used for creating a new construct or for modifying an existing one. Up to 10 power, propulsion, protection, and weapons can be stored (counted separately for each part type). This inventory can be used as a pseudo-storage mechanism by preemptively eating a part and disabling the Scrap Engine to prevent use until later. This is more efficient than keeping parts in regular inventory, but is more restrictive since the parts used for modification can't be explicitly selected anymore. If over 10 parts of a given type is fed to the engine, the first part in the engine's inventory will be destroyed.
[[Heading:2]]Broken/Faulty parts[[/Heading]]
The output of the Scrap Engine is not negatively affected by inputting low-integrity, broken, or faulty parts. As such, it may be a good idea to feed these parts to the Scrap Engine instead of throwing them away or letting them become totally destroyed.
[[Heading:2]]Protection parts[[/Heading]]
Rather than going toward creating new constructs, protection is instead used to reinforce the Scrap Engine itself. The first time that a protection item is consumed, the Scrap Engine will turn itself into the [[Arm. Scrap Engine]], gaining more coverage and integrity. Every subsequent armor piece consumed will restore 100 Scrap Engine integrity.
[[Heading]]Creating constructs[[/Heading]]
If 2 power, 3 propulsion, or 4 weapons are stored in the engine's inventory at once, a new construct can be created by combining all of the parts into a new one. Duplicates of a part may be used in new constructions, but at least 2 unique parts must be involved in new construct creation. Note: There is a maximum of 1 power and 1 propulsion construct each at a time, but up to 4 weapon constructs can be created. New constructs are created with a mix of the stats of the original items put into them. The Scrap Engine will preferentially create new constructs as opposed to modifying existing ones.
[[Heading:2]]Naming[[/Heading]]
The names of constructs are generated from a combination of parts processed up to that point. For example, eating an [[Ion Engine]] and a [[Nuclear Core]] may result in a Nuclear-Ion Core. Further modifications may cause the name to change over time.
[[Heading:2]]Type[[/Heading]]
The initial type of a construct will be selected randomly from its original parts. This can cause unusual stats, such as treads much faster than typically seen when created in combination with a faster propulsion type like flight. Like names, the type of a construct can change over time with more modifications. Propulsion constructs gain all natural ability of the propulsion type, like a flight construct granting bot hopping, or a leg construct granting running avoidance bonuses.
[[Heading]]Modification[[/Heading]]
Constructs can be modified when at least 2 different parts are stored in the Scrap Engine's inventory at a given time. For example, 2 [[Aluminum Leg|Aluminum Legs]] would not result in modification, but 1 Aluminum Leg and 1 [[Imp. Aluminum Leg]] would cause a modification, as would 1 Aluminum Leg and 1 [[Flight Unit]].
Each time a construct is modified, 1-5 random stats (generally higher numbers for weapons, lower numbers for power and propulsion) are modified based on the parts that were just processed. Additionally, if there is a slot available, the modified construct may grow in size. The growing chance decreases as the construct gets bigger, so increasing from 1 slot to 2 slots is much easier than increasing from 2 to 3. Additionally, modifying a construct will restore about 1/3 of its integrity.
[[Heading:2]]Multiple slots[[/Heading]]
When parts evolve into multiple slots, some of the stats also scale proportionally. Resource costs always scale in accordance with the number of slots, as will integrity and coverage. Aside from that, primary aspects of the slot type like energy generation, support, and damage will all scale based on slot number. Stats that are percentage based, like overload burnout and critical hit chance, don't tend to change based on slot counts.
One unique interaction between multiple weapon constructs is the ability to merge. Rather than growing into a unique 2 slot weapon construct, sometimes 2 existing constructs will combine into a single multislot construct. The stats of both component constructs will be mixed together into the resultant construct.
[[Heading:2]]Special Abilities[[/Heading]]
Non-standard/special stats/abilities may be given to the constructs based on the type of part eaten. For example, eating a Cld. power source such as a [[Cld. Ion Engine]] may grant the ability to overload the power construct. These special stats/abilities may also be removed at random by further modifications. If a construct has a stat specific to a part type, such as overload on a flight/propulsion type, and changes to a new type that no longer supports it, such as treads, that special stat will be removed.
[[Heading:3]]List of special stats/abilities applicable to constructs[[/Heading]]
[[Table]]Slot|Stat/ability|Part to consume|Loss on type change?||Power|Overload|Any Cld. power source like [[Cld. Ion Engine]]|Never||Propulsion|Overload|Any Cld. flight or hover unit like [[Surge Thruster]]|Change to Wheel, Leg, or Treads||Propulsion|Siege Mode|Any 2 slot treads like [[Hvy. Siege Treads]]|Change to non-Treads||Weapon|Overload|Any Cld. energy weapon like [[Cld. Particle Cannon]]|Change to non-Energy Cannon/Gun||Weapon|Waypoints|Any guided weapon like [[Gui. Plasma Cannon]]|Never||Weapon|[[Spoiler]]Entropic damage type, additionally loss of integrity per shot[[/Spoiler]]|[[Spoiler]]Any Vortex weapon like [[Vortex Rifle]][[/Spoiler]]|Never[[/Table]]
[[Heading]]Part destruction[[/Heading]]
Unlike most parts, constructs are not always instantly destroyed when they run out of integrity. Any multislot parts are instead reduced in slot count and partially restored in integrity. Though the slot may be hard to regrow again, it does make constructs more resilient than they first might appear. The only exception to this rule is that a Vortex weapon construct will be entirely destroyed if it runs out of integrity due to being fired.
When any construct is forced to shrink in size via damage, fully destroyed, or manually removed, the Scrap Engine will be slightly damaged in the process, reporting that [[GameText]]Scrap Engine damaged due to network destabilization[[/GameText]].
[[Heading]]General Strategies[[/Heading]]
Scrap Engine tends to be a very powerful but often unreliable part. It can generate abnormally powerful constructs, far outstripping anything else available, and then snatch the positive aspects of them away and leave you with a weapon that generates 400 heat per shot. As such, making modifications with a lot of spare parts around is always a good idea to reduce the chance of getting stuck with a hard to use part. On the other hand, if a great construct is created, it may often be worth postponing further modifications until needed to repair integrity. Otherwise, the best qualities may be lost before long.
A good strategy is to approach the modifications with moderation. Going all in on thermal energy cannons may result in a high damaging high meltdown weapon, but may also spike your own heat generation past reasonable levels. Mixing in lower heat generating kinetic guns and cannons will tend to balance your weapons out with more sustainable energy and heat resource costs. Propulsion can be approached similarly. Eating a mixture of hover, legs, and tread propulsion will tend toward middle of the road constructs that aren't amazing at anything in particular, but you will rarely end up with the excessive highs and lows that can occur if only one type of propulsion is focused on. Additionally, being more lenient in what you eat will help keep constructs topped off on integrity.
For a higher risk higher reward approach, mixing extremes like treads and flight can result in some incredibly overpowered propulsion constructs. A primarily treads-orientated propulsion construct only needs a single good flight modification to take the speed down to close to the 40 speed range. However, bad modification can instead lose lots of integrity or support. Doing this is safer with a lot of spare parts to eat in case things go south. Another example of a beneficial extreme is combining high critical rate Hyp. weapons like [[Hyp. Gauss Cannon]] with meltdown criticals from thermal cannons. It is possible to create an abnormally high meltdown critical % weapon this way, at the risk of losing some weapon damage.
[[Heading:2]]Multi-projectile Weapons[[/Heading]]
[[Flak Gun|Flak Guns]] can produce excellent constructs due to their high projectile count. While some stats get reduced to compensate for the increased projectile count, it is still possible to achieve overall high damage and a high critical percent chance. It is even possible to go beyond the original weapon's projectile count (6 in the case of Flak Guns). Heat transfer is another good stat to apply to a large projectile construct. A high heat transfer combined with a high projectile count can melt bots nearly instantly.
[[Heading:2]]Miscellaneous Tips[[/Heading]]
[[List]]Have a stockpile of parts before equipping the Scrap Engine - Recycling is a good place to get a strong start on constructs due to the large number of different types of parts to eat, and the lack of big threats. If saving Scrap Engine for later, try to create a good sized loot pile ahead of time to get a head start on growing the constructs.|Don't go all in on EM damage - If all of your weapon slots are a single construct of EM type damage and you run into a [[Programmer]], you're going to have a rough time.|Be careful of destroying cover - Construct weapons tends to be much more powerful than typical weapons and will blow through walls right and left. This is good in some situations, but it can also leave you wide open to multiple angles of attack.|Leave a slot open for a [[Launchers]] - Dedicating all of your weapon slots to constructs makes it hard to deal with [[Swarmer|Swarmers]] or other large groups of hostiles.|Make careful [[Storage Unit|Storage]] selections - Larger storage units like [[Hcp. Storage Unit]] and above may be difficult to carry if flight and hover propulsion are eaten. Smaller storage units can be carried more easily without overweight penalties with a bad support modifications.|Modify constructs with slots open - If trying to grow a construct, make sure that an empty slot is available for growth. This is especially the case for weapon constructs. Even though two weapon constructs may occasionally merge into a single multislot construct, it is more reliable to grow the slot number by keeping one available.|Don't have more than 3 weapons in engine inventory at a time - If trying to grow a weapon construct in number of slots, having 4 parts in inventory with an open weapon slot will always result in a new construct being created rather than having the existing construct modified. It may take a little longer, but making sure to process only 2 at a time will ensure maximum modifications and the highest chance to grow a weapon construct in slot count.

"Search Patrol","Other","Search patrols are a unique type of [[0b10]] aligned [[Patrol Squad|patrol squad]]. They can be dispatched if Cogmind generates a lot of [[Alert]] from non-combat sources. This is primarily caused by being spotted by [[Watcher|Watchers]] or [[N-01 Spotter|Spotters]], guard bots like [[Sentry|Sentries]], or by being spotted by any combat hostile and then running away and losing tracking. If the Alert level is above the typical [[Assault Squad|Assault]] range of level 2/400 influence and Cogmind has gained the majority of the influence from these non-combat sources, there is a chance that one or more search patrols may be dispatched. If a search patrol is announced, influence will drop by 150. This will be accompanied by the alert [[GameText]]ALERT: Heightened foreign activity detected, dispatching search patrol.[[/GameText]] The alert will also indicate if multiple search patrols are to be sent out simultaneously. One or more ARCs will be dispatched after a few more turns. These ARCs behave similarly as regular patrol ARCs and have the same standard patrol contents within them. However, search squads will choose random points on the map to patrol to rather than having a fixed patrol route like all other patrols.","","","","","",""

[[Heading:3]][[Assembled]] Absorption[[/Heading]]
While the Exoskeleton is damaged, Assembled can be absorbed to repair it by 30 integrity when standing next to Cogmind.
[[Heading:3]]Core Dependence[[/Heading]]
Cogmind's core becomes dependent on the Exoskeleton. Even if Cogmind still has remaining core, if the Exoskeleton is destroyed the game will instantly be loss.
[[Heading:3]]Enhanced Hypermatrix Pings[[/Heading]]
Whenever entering a new floor with Assembled spawns available (all main 0b10-controlled floors, [[DSF|DSFs]], and [[Command]]), 6-8 Assembled will appear near Cogmind. Additionally, the Exoskeleton provides the CRM's hypermatrix ping detection and Assembled summoning ability at all times rather than only while at 1/3 core.
[[Heading:3]]Damage Reduction[[/Heading]]
The Exoskeleton provides a 50% damage resistance to all conventional damage types. This effect stacks with most [[Defensive Utilities]], but not with [[Resistance Devices]].
[[Heading:3]]Deactivation-Proof[[/Heading]]
The Exoskeleton cannot be deactivated by any means. This includes manual deactivation as well as [[Heat]]-based side-effects.
[[Heading:3]]Infowar[[/Heading]]
The Exoskeleton provides extremely powerful sensor intel in an 18 tile radius. Perfect bot detection, terrain scanning, part detection, and hidden door detection is granted within this radius.
[[Heading:3]]High Coverage[[/Heading]]
While not exactly a unique ability, the Exoskeleton has a uniquely high 30,000 coverage which dwarfs every other item's coverage in the game. Most typical forms of armor are entirely unhelpful with the Exoskeleton equipped.
[[Heading:3]][[Maximum Security]] Triggering[[/Heading]]
As soon as Cogmind is spotted by any combat hostile in most [[0b10]]-controlled maps, Maximum Security will be immediately engaged. One notable exception is that Maximum Security will not be triggered in Command. Non-combat [[Watcher|Watchers]] and [[Operator|Operators]] whose associated [[Terminal]] hasn't be destroyed will also trigger this effect.
[[Image]]Exoskeleton4x.png|Cogmind's new look[[/Image]]
[[Heading:3]]New Appearance[[/Heading]]
Cogmind will take on the Sigix Warrior artwork, or the uppercase X character in ASCII mode.
[[Heading:3]]Slot Fixing[[/Heading]]
When Cogmind enters the Exoskeleton, all slots will be reset to a total of 1 Power, 3 Propulsion, 3 Utility, and 2 Weapon slots. However, Cogmind gets some boosts in exchange for the slots. Cogmind gains 100 fixed energy capacity, and every slot above the new 9 total slot count provides 3 innate energy generation and 5 heat dissipation. Not counting [[Core Expander|Core Expanders]], a typical -3 Section 7 provides 36 energy and 60 dissipation while a -2 Section 7 provides 42 energy and 70 dissipation. Slots can be evolved as normal after entering the Exoskeleton, including using Core Expanders. As a side-note, a [[Core Physics Calibrator]] cannot remove the 3 propulsion slots and force removal of the Exoskeleton.
[[Heading:3]]UI Intel[[/Heading]]
There are 4 new pieces of intel located at the bottom of the inventory UI:
[[List]]Threats: Counts the number of active hostiles within sensor radius.|Components: Counts the number of parts on the floor within sensor radius.|Ping number: Counts the number of active but untriggered Assembled hypermatrix pings.|Tor distance: Lists the distance to the Tor, the Sigix spaceship. The number in thousands place varies based on the map, but up to the hundreds place, it roughly indicates how many tiles Cogmind must travel to get to the nearest [[Surface]] exit.[[/List]]
[[Heading:3]]Unique Interactions[[/Heading]]
Cogmind becomes indistinguishable from a Sigix Warrior to some NPCs. [[Warlord]] will turn aggressive upon seeing Cogmind during the -2 [[Research]] attack or when summoned via Command cave seals. [[MAIN.C]] has unique encounter dialogue and a special phase 2 encounter after the outer shell is defeated, summoning 4 additional [[M Shell/Atk]] and 4 [[M Shell/Def]]s to his side. The [[Architect]] will recognize Cogmind, but also has unique encounter dialogue.","","","","","",""

"Squad","Other","Squads are groups of one or more robots that work together as a single group. The majority of the squads in the game are [[0b10]]-aligned and thus hostile to Cogmind, but there are also [[Derelict]] squads that can be either friendly or hostile to Cogmind depending on the circumstances. Some 0b10 squad types can be recalled using a low success rate Recall hack at a [[Terminal]], but all squad types can be located using an Enumerate hack. The numbers of all squad types, although not their compositions or locations, can be revealed with the Enumerate(Squads) hack.
Typically, one bot per squad is designated as the [[Squad Leader]]. Squad leaders are the only bots that have the AI or order type active. All other bots are set to follow the squad leader. If the squad leader is destroyed, the other bots in the squad will either end up wandering around randomly, or leaving the map if their squad leader was already leaving the map.
[[Heading]]Types of 0b10 Squads[[/Heading]]
[[List]][[Assault Squad]] - Dispatched by 0b10 to target Cogmind directly. Unlike most squads that walk to their target, all Assault contents are contained with a faster wheeled [[C-30 ARC]]. Only get dispatched if Cogmind has [[Alert]] level 2 or higher (400 influence).|[[Coupling Squad]] - Dispatched periodically by 0b10 on any floors where [[Garrison (Machine)|Garrisons]] are available. Consist of a single [[Programmer]] carrying multiple [[Relay Couplers]] to restock a Garrison.|[[Demolisher Squad]] - Dispatched by 0b10 to eliminate large groups of hostiles, particularly [[Assembled]].|[[Extermination Squad]] - Dispatched periodically by 0b10 in [[Factory]] and beyond. They consist entirely of Programmers and will always head directly to Cogmind.|[[Garrison Squad]] - Dispatched by 0b10 Garrisons when combat occurs near that Garrison. Bots will roam around the area where the attack occurred, then return after 200-300 turns.|[[Spoiler]][[Intercept Squad]] - Dispatched by 0b10 directly to Cogmind only in a few special circumstances. Intercept squads consist of powerful [[Prototype Robot|Prototype]] bots designed to quickly neutralize Cogmind.[[/Spoiler]]|[[Investigation Squad]] - Dispatched by 0b10 to investigate an area of interest for 300-400 turns, then they exit the level.|[[Patrol Squad]] - Patrol between two points of interest at varying speeds. Unlike most other squads, patrols only appear at the beginning of a map, and more will not be replenished.|[[Reinforcement Squad]] - Dispatched by 0b10 to permanently reinforce an area of interest. Similar to investigations but do not leave their post and will patrol around the area they are summoned to forever.|[[Security Squad]] - Stand guard at intersections, on top of exits, and in rooms with part stockpiles or Machines. Will typically not move unless they are alerted of a hostile.|[[Surveillance Squad]] - Patrol between two points of interest similar to a Patrol squad, but made up of a single [[Watcher]] instead of combat bots.|[[Transport Squad]] - [[Hauler]] guarded by 0-2 [[Grunt|Grunts]] that transport parts from place to place. Empty Haulers may pick up parts fabricated at a [[Fabricator]].[[/List]]","","","","","",""

"Sterilization","Other","Sterilization is a special [[0b10]] response to Cogmind destroying too many combat bots on a single map. When activated, the ambient heat of the floor will be increased forever until Cogmind exits the map. As the heat increases, any remaining bots, parts on the ground, machines, and traps will all melt. Occasionally, machines will explode before they melt.
[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Sterilization System[[/Lore]]
[[Heading]]Triggering[[/Heading]]
The number of bots to kill to trigger Sterilization depends on the map.
[[Table]]Map|Bots to kill||[[DSF]]|8||[[Materials]]|50||[[Storage]]|75||Most other maps|130[[/Table]]
[[Garrison|Garrisons]], [[Wastes]], and [[Command]] can not be Sterilized.
[[Heading]]Timeline of Events[[/Heading]]
[[List]]0: Non-combat bots start evacuating the map and head to 0b10-controlled exits, log messages [[GameText]]ALERT: Persistent threat exposed, engaging [map] sterilization system.[[/GameText]] and [[GameText]]ALERT: All non-combat units evacuation[[/GameText]].|100: Combat bots start evacuating the map and head to 0b10-controlled exits, log message [[GameText]]ALERT: All combat units evacuate.[[/GameText]]|300: Ambient heat increases by 10, log message [[GameText]]ALERT: Ambient heat levels +10.[[/GameText]]450: Ambient heat increases by a further 10|Etc. +10 heat for every 150 turns.[[/List]]
Note: Unlike most other maps, in [[Access]] bots are not evacuated. The evacuation-related alerts will not appear and the bots will continue to stay on the map as usual.
[[Heading:2]]Rapid Sterilization[[/Heading]]
DSFs have a unique rapid sterilization system that works much quicker than normal sterilization. Ambient heat increases begin only 20 turns after the initial announcement and occur every 15 turns after that.
[[Heading]]Part Melting[[/Heading]]
After Sterilization is triggered, parts will begin to melt every 30-40 turns and be destroyed instantly. Parts that are 200 integrity or greater are safe from melting. Parts with a lower integrity are more likely to melt than those with higher integrity. For example, [[Treads]] and [[Armor]] tend to last longer or be immune to melting altogether, while fragile processors will melt almost instantly. Parts only melt when within a 20-tile radius around Cogmind, so with a good enough speed, timing, and luck, it is possible to grab parts that would otherwise melt quickly in the heat.","","","","","",""

"Terminal","Other","Terminals are interactable Machines that [[Cogmind]] can hack for various benefits (such as recalling an [[Extermination Squad]]!) and info. Terminals are also often guarded by an [[Operator]], which if alerted will use this terminal to call for a [[Reinforcement Squad]] unless it or the terminal is disabled/destroyed.
The main differences between security levels and terminal types are are :
[[Table]]Security level|Average size|Armor|Direct hacks|Base direct hacking success rate|Base indirect hacking success rate|Base detection rate||
1|Small (1 tile and such)|18|Few available direct hacks|Depends on the hack|-15% compared to direct hacks|20 or 25%||
2|Medium|25|More available direct hacks|Half of level 1, rounded down|-30% compared to direct hacks|50%||
3|Large|30|Lots of available direct hacks|Half of level 2, rounded down|-45% compared to direct hacks|60%, 70% or 80%||
Terminals inside [[Garrison|Garrisons]]|Small (1 tile and such)|18|One of Access(Emergency), Download(Navigation), Download(Registry), or Download(Security)|Same as level 2|Same as level 2|Same as level 2||
Door-type/Lore terminals|Usually 1 tile|18|Usually one direct hack, to open the relevant door or get relevant lore record|Depends on door/lore record|Unavailable|Same as level 1||
Cave outpost terminal|1 tile|18|Random mix of flavor (useless) and intel ""Report"" hacks, with flavor reports always grouped on top of the list and intel reports grouped on the bottom of the list|100%|Unavailable|Same as level 1[[/Table]]
Non-door Garrion terminals are always security level 2, while door-type, lore, and cave outpost terminals are always level 1.

Unauthorized hacking (trojan and force hacks) success rate follows the same logic as direct hacking.

Download(Navigation), Download(Registry), and Download(Security) hacks are only available inside Garrisons.

The frequency of each Terminal security level is dependant on the area's depth. At depth -10, almost all terminals are level 1, a few are rarely level 2, and level 3 terminals are basically impossible to find[[Comment]]Maybe literally impossible?[[/Comment]]. As Cogmind ascends each depth, level 3 terminals become more common, while level 1 terminals become rarer. At first, level 2 terminals become more common, but eventually this reverses as they become less common. At depth -1, level 3 terminals are very common, level 2 terminals are rare while level 1 terminals are basically impossible to find[[Comment]]Maybe literally impossible?[[/Comment]] (excluding limited terminals).
[[Image]]../game_sprites/Terminal.png|Level 3 terminal![[/Image]]

[[Heading]]Hacking[[/Heading]]
Hacks are listed at [[~/hacks|the Cog-Minder Hacks page]], and explained further in the Cogmind manual.
Common chance factors:
[[List]]
Terminal Security Level - Higher-rated terminals are harder to hack, with direct hacks having half the base success rate they would have on a lower security terminal. Because of this, direct hacks with a negative base success rate will actually have a higher success rate on higher security terminals compared to lower security terminals (half of -8% is -4%).|
Manual Commands - (Security level * -15%) success chance penalty.|
[[Corruption]] - Penalty of -1% per 3% of system corruption to success chance.|
Use penalty - Successfully hacking Alert(Purge), Recall(Investigation), Recall(Reinforcements), Recall(Extermination) or Recall(Assault) permanently reduces the success rate for that specific hack by 10% for the entire map. This penalty is applied for every successful use of the relevant hack, lowering the success rate by 10% every time. The only way to remove it is to leave the map.
[[Hackware]] - Each attached offensive hackware improves success chances by the amount specified in the part description.|
Operator [[Data Core]] - Moving over an Operator's Data Core will automatically collect and it extract its dynamic key, which provides a one-time 1.5x multiplier to the base success rate of all direct hacks, excluding those with a negative base success rate. The dynamic key can only be used before it expires at its Operator's terminal.|
[[Multitool]] - Using a Multitool on a terminal's interactive tile removes all direct hacks and causes tracing to begin immediately, but applies a modifier to indirect hacks.|
[[Operator]] allies - Having allied Operators within 20 tiles provides a +10% bonus to hacks for the first Operator, +5% for the second, +2% for the third, and +1% for all others.|
[[Spoiler]]Botnets trojans - Installing Botnet trojans on other terminals in the same map provides a +6% bonus to hacks for the first botnet installed, +3% for the second, and +1% for all others. Note that a botnet will not affect hacking success chance on the terminal it is installed on.[[/Spoiler]]

[[Heading]]Detection/Trace[[/Heading]]
[[B]]Warning - This section is lacking in precision and information![[/B]] Please consider contributing to clarify it and/or add information.

Terminals have a varying base detection rate, dependent mostly on their security level. This base detection rate can be lowered through defensive hackware by the amount specified on their part description, and/or [[Spoiler]]permanently lowered by destroying Network Hubs in [[Hub_04(d)]][[/Spoiler]]. However, it can never be lowered below 10%.

Getting detected will cause a trace to start. Each additional hack attempt will cause the trace progress to advance by an amount which can be reduced in the same way as detection rate. Trace advance can never be lowered below 15%. When failing a hack, a catastrophic failure may occur (more likely on higher security terminals), causing the detection rate to go up by far more.

Getting fully traced may result in receiving [[Corruption]], your [[Hackware]] breaking, and will very likely cause an [[Investigation Squad]].

[[Heading]]Central database authorization[[/Heading]]
Indirect hacks for lore records, prototype IDs, part or robot schematics, and robot analyses, are all considered ""database hacks"". Successfully hacking any of them has a base 25% chance to instead cause an area-wide central database lockout, preventing further database hacks. However, direct hacks of those types remain possible after a central database lockout and cannot cause one.

Additionally, not all lore records, parts schematic, robot analyses or robot schematics can be indirectly hacked on all terminals. Terminals have a level of database authorization dependent on security level and current depth, equal to (10 - current depth + security level). It is only possible to indirectly hack a part/robot schematic or analysis if the terminal's authorization level is equal to or higher than the rating/tier of the relevant part/robot (prototype parts are considered to have a +1 to their rating for this purpose).
For example, at depth -5, level 2 terminals have an authorization level of (10 - 5 + 2) = 7.
Lore records also have a rating/tier, but it isn't communicated in-game. 

[[Heading]]Direct hacking subtleties[[/Heading]]
There are many small subtleties to direct hacking. Here is an incomplete list:
[[List]]
[[GameText]][Local Emergency Access][[/GameText]], [[GameText]][Purge Alert][[/GameText]] and all [[GameText]][Traps][[/GameText]] hacks appear greyed out in direct hacks if they are currently useless. In other words, if a terminal has a greyed out direct [[GameText]][Locate Traps][[/GameText]] hack, then there are no traps within the terminal's range.|
If either [[GameText]][Disarm Traps][[/GameText]] or [[GameText]][Reprogram Traps][[/GameText]] is available as a direct hack, then [[GameText]][Locate Traps][[/GameText]] will also be a direct hack on that terminal.|
If [[GameText]][Purge Alert][[/GameText]] is available as a direct hack, then [[GameText]][Check Alert][[/GameText]] will also be a direct hack on that terminal.|
If there is a direct [[GameText]][Recall][[/GameText]] hack available, then the corresponding [[GameText]][Status][[/GameText]] hack will also be available on that terminal.|
[[GameText]][Prototype ID Bank][[/GameText]] can only be hacked directly once, and is never greyed out, even when it does not yield new prototype IDs.|
When entering a map, if you already have a schematic that's supposed to appear on a terminal, that schematic hack may be re-rolled.[[Sup]][[Terminal#references|[1]]][[/Sup]]|
Direct [[GameText]][Schematic][[/GameText]] hacks may be of a higher rating/tier than the terminal's central database authorization, up to the same rating/tier as the current depth's level 3 terminals' central database authorization.
[[/List]]

[[Comment]]Uncategorized information - Stuff i didn't think of a way to integrate into the structure of this article

I wasn't sure where to put this, since it isn't exclusive to direct hacking:

[[GameText]][Prototype ID Bank][[/GameText]] gives a number of prototype IDs equal to 1 + Terminal security level.

Transport squads are [[0b10]] aligned [[Squad|squads]] that carry parts from one location to another and can be found on most 0b10 controlled maps. They typically consist of a single [[Hauler]] and 0-2 guard [[Grunt|Grunts]] that escort them. Haulers that are guarded have [[Prototype Part|prototypes]] inside them, but some unguarded Haulers may still have prototype parts. If a Hauler that carries prototype parts is attacked, they will summon a [[Reinforcement Squad]] to their location on depths -7 and higher. Typical transport squads all start on the map, and more of them do not appear if destroyed. Transport squads can be Enumerated at [[Terminal|Terminals]], and a [[Transport Network Coupler]] or [[Modified TNC]] will reveal their current positions. The Modified TNC will also show the contents of all Haulers. Similarly, the Manifests hack shows all of the contents of all Haulers on the map, as well as any associated guards. This can be useful to determine that certain guarded/unguarded Haulers are worthwhile to try to loot. The

Cargo Convoys are a unique type of transport squad that appear in main [[Factory]] and [[Research]] maps. They are much more heavily guarded than typical Transport squads, but the parts they carry are also much higher rating than usual.

"Warlord (Alignment)","Other","Aligning with [[Warlord]] is one of the major faction [[Alignment|alignments]] available to Cogmind in a run and can be done in his [[Warlord (Location)|Base]] in either -5 or -4 [[Upper Caves]]. Aligning with Warlord has effects on 2 major events later in the game. It triggers an event where Warlord, [[God Mode]], and friendly [[Derelict|Derelicts]] assault -2 [[Research]]. It also has a lategame effect in [[Command]]: [[Redacted]]When opening the Command seals, [[Warlord (Command)]] will appear along with a group of other friendly Derelicts.[[/Redacted]]
One Warlord alignment-related item is the [[Encrypted Comm Array]]. If Cogmind either compromises [[Garrison|Garrison]] or [[Sterilization|sterilizes]] [[DSF|DSFs]], Cogmind can receive the Comm Array and learn the depth of Warlord's base. If enough assistance is provided, a force multiplier can provide allies during the -2 assault and in the [[Redacted]]Command Seals[[/Redacted]]. After seeing Warlord in his base, the Comm Array is no longer of any use.
[[Heading]]Restrictions[[/Heading]]
Cogmind cannot align with Warlord in the following scenarios:
[[List]][[RIF]] is installed - The base will be hostile to Cogmind upon entering the base|Attacking [[Scraptown]] - The base will be hostile to Cogmind upon entry|[[Imprint]] - Warlord will be disappointed in Cogmind|[[UFD]] - Warlord will think Cogmind is a spy[[/List]]
[[Heading]]-2 Research Assault[[/Heading]]
The event will begin with the alert [[GameText]]ALERT: Engineering response network critical failure, offline[[/GameText]]. More announcements will show up, but the next most important one will be [[GameText]]Warlord currently on norther/central/southern western approach. All units hit designated targets[[/GameText]] which indicates where Warlord and [[God Mode]] will appear on the map. 50 turns after entering the map, another announcement [[GameText]]Trap arrays successfully disabled[[/GameText]] will come with all traps being removed from the map. 110 after entering the maps, [[GameText]]Machine network successfully disabled[[/GameText]] will indicate that every machine on the map is now shut down except for [[Garrison (Machine)|Garrisons]] due to the follow-up message [[GameText]]Unrecognized interference restored Garrison access controls. Oops. Just blast them.[[/GameText]] 250 turns after entering the map and every 150 turns after that, 3 different assault squad spawns will appear from Garrisons and map exits with the message [[GameText]]Unaware assault squad dispatched in northeast/southeast/southwest/northwest quadrant.[[/GameText]] The spawn location will be indicated on the map. Every 100 turns 1 Derelict squad will spawn on the left side of the map for each tunnel. After 1000 turns on the map, Warlord will tell Cogmind that it is time to retreat and to open the [[Redacted]]Cave Seals in [[Command]] for the final push.[[/Redacted]]
[[Heading:2]]Downside of event[[/Heading]]
As a result of the Warlord assault, additional patrols will be dispatched in [[Testing]], [[Quarantine]], and [[Access]]. Patrols will increase by 40% in these maps. This is most significant in Access, upping the Patrol count from 20 to 28. A few Warlord bots will also appear at the entrance to these maps.
[[Image]]Research Warlord Squads.png|A few Derelict squads[[/Image]]
[[Heading]]Derelict Forces[[/Heading]]
The Derelict forces consist of many unique bots during this event. All of them appear as non-controllable allies that do not generate any alert for Cogmind. There are 3 spawn points in the form of giant tunnels. Each tunnel is dug out by a [[Borebot]] escorted by 2 [[Samaritan|Samaritans]]. They will dig straight across the map to the right side. Tiles that are dug out by Borebots are safe to travel on and will not cave-in. Warlord attack squads can vary greatly in composition but are made up of the following bots:
[[List]][[Butcher (7)|Butchers]]|[[Commander|Commanders]]|[[Dragon|Dragons]]|[[Fireman (7)|Firemen]]|[[Guerrilla (7)|Guerrillas]]|[[Hydra|Hydras]]|[[Knight]]|[[Marauder (8)|Marauders]]|[[Martyr (7)|Martyrs]]|[[Savage (7)|Savages]]|[[Thug (7)|Thugs]]|[[Troll|Trolls]]|[[Wasp (7)|Wasps]]|[[Wizard (7)|Wizards]][[/List]]
[[Image]]Research Warlord Assault Squads.png|0b10 Warlord response assault squad[[/Image]]The 0b10 forces come in groups of 3 bots. There are always 2 (not necessarily of the same type) of [[Executioner]], [[Striker]], and [[D-83 Annihilator]] bots along with a [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] full of bots. They roam around the map looking for bots to fight.
[[Heading:2]][[DD-05H]][[/Heading]]
Sometimes DD-05H will appear a few hundred turns into the invasion. It will run toward Warlord and then follow Warlord around for the duration of the event. When this happens, the [[Tinkerer]] PL-HR7 will also appear at one of the invasion entrances on the left side of the map. PL-HR7 will drop a [[Warlord Statue]] that Cogmind can use.
[[Heading]]Encrypted Comm Array[[/Heading]]
If Cogmind has aided Warlord forces by compromising Garrisons and DSFs, Cogmind may get 1 or 2 additional special escort squads based on the force multiplier. These special squads will head straight to Cogmind's location and follow. The higher the force multiplier, the stronger the squads available for escort. The special squads are as follows:
[[List]]Bridgeowners Association: Trolls|Cat Herders: Wasps|Death Star: Martyrs|Department No. 42: Firemen|Offensive Angels: Wasps|Golden Rifles: Commanders, Geurrillas, Surgeons, and Thugs|Grunt Murderers: Thugs|Gunslingers: Guerrillas|Lair Dwellers: Hydras|Lobotomizers: Wizards|Lucky Slug: Marauders|Magnificent Bastards: Mutants|Metalheads: Mutants|Knights of the Pentagonal Table: Knights|Railsplitters: Guerrillas|Shockpunchers: Wizards|Smaug Morners: Dragons|The Professionals: Commanders, Guerrillas, Knights, Surgeons, Trolls, and Wizards|Vikings: Butchers|Viscera Detail: Butchers and Savages[[/List]]
This event tends to be great for Cogmind. The primary downsides is that the machine network turns off relatively early into the event and locating the desired exit can be a pain. Getting stuck in a bad position without any Derelict allies can also be painful since the assaults, particularly the prototype bots and demolishers, pack quite a punch. However, the large number of alert-free allies and free loot from the bots fighting is great to any build. Like the Revision 17 event, this event will also cause the maps to have no Heavies. Finding any exit is usually possible by following the assault dispatch notifications. Assaults will be dispatched out of any Garrison or exit. The only exits that assaults do not come from are Quarantine prefab exits. In that case, using other infowar like terrain scanning and drones is the best way to locate these exits.","Spoiler","","","","",""
