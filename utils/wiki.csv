"Access","Location","Access is the last [[0b10]]-controlled main floor that only appears on -1. Access is the most challenging main map with increased patrol density, number of bots per patrol, map size, and level and difficulty in hackable machines compared to [[Research]]. These maps have a 150x300 tile size, either being a tall vertical level or a wide horizontal level. Access maps tend to be fairly well connected across corridors and rooms, and have fewer large rooms and larger hallways more similar to [[Factory]] than the cramped maze-like layout of Research. There are only 2 exits in Access, and locating and taking the desired exit can be especially challenging.
In contrast with the small number of exits, Access has the highest number of [[Garrison (Machine)|Garrisons]] with 6 machines spread throughout the level. Shutting or destroying Garrisons is always a good idea, but there is a special interaction in Access: [[Spoiler]]If all 6 Garrisons are shut down or disabled, [[Maximum Security]] will be triggered, sending huge waves of hostiles directly to Cogmind. Either be prepared to fight your way out, or have an escape route planned for a fast airborne build to avoid engaging in combat.[[/Spoiler]]
The biggest bot upgrade in Access is the [[Behemoth]] change. All Behemoths will become [[B-99 Colossus|Colossi]], extremely dangerous and hard to kill threats. They have some incredibly good loot, but trying to kill them with conventional methods is difficult due to their high damage output, high integrity, and [[Adv. Force Field]] reducing damage they take. Avoiding them or running if spotted is usually the best plan.
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
There is one special machine in Access. The Energy Cycler is a large explosive machine that appears in rooms with a 2 tile wide doorway. When it is destroyed, several [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]] will spawn from Garrisons and start roaming around the map. Additionally, all of the sealed heavy doors on the map will retract, allowing access to exits.

[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There are 2 types of exits on Access floors. Both exits can be identified by long 2 tile wide corridors leading to the [[Terminal]]-locked side of the exits. They are both identifiable by look alone:
[[List]][[Surface]] exit: There are 2 sides to this Surface exit. One side is locked behind an 80 armor Sealed Barrier locked by a [[Terminal]] with a base 7% open chance. The other side has Sealed Heavy Doors that are much easier to break through, but is guarded by 2 Colossi. Blowing up the Energy Cyclers will open only the side with the Sealed Barrier. Trying to rush head-on past the Behemoths is usually not recommended due to their extreme damage output and heavy knockback.|[[Redacted]][[Command]] exit: There are 2 sides to this Command exit. One side has a 2 tile snaking corridor that has 3 consecutive Sealed Barriers. Each has a base 30% open chance. The other side has a single row of Sealed Heavy Doors, a guard area with 2 Terminators and 2 Colossi, and 3 more Sealed Heavy Doors blocking the exit. Blowing up the Energy Cycler will only open the side with the 3 Sealed Barriers.[[/Redacted]][[/List]]

"Access_0","Location","Access_0 is a non-[[0b10]] [[Branch]] off of [[Command]] that only appears on -1. It is the home to the [[Architect]], the [[A bots]], and several types of Enhanced bots. Access_0 is a very heavily combat-oriented map that has 2 unique wintypes available and has the Architect present, a special boss bot that will award a + on the scoresheet when defeated. It features a multitude of unique bots, a unique bossfight mechanic, and many of the strongest hostiles in the game to fight.
The overall structure of Access_0 can be split into 2 groups with a small bridge connecting section guarded by [[A2]]. The bulk of the map is on the right side, with the bridge dividing a small section of the left side of the map. Overall, the layout is comparable to a  more maze-like [[Caves]]. There are many dead ends and nearly-connected areas that can be safely dug out when noticed with terrain scanning. Cogmind spawns on the right side of the map along with the Architect, [[A8]], and 2 [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]]. The right side of the map can contain [[Alien Artifact]]-containing Workstation machines, large item caches on the ground or in Reinforced Shells, random bits of machinery, and Subspace Access Nodes. Typically, there are 4 Access Nodes on the right side of the map, although very rarely one can appear on the left. Otherwise, the left side can contain all the same things that the right side has and a few more. The left side will always contain a Singularity Gate machine along with a Gate Controls Terminal that can control it. At the bottom left of the map, there is an Architect Logs Terminal wrapped in a 120 armor Architect Shell.
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:3]]Subspace Access Node[[/Heading]]
There are 4 of these Access Nodes, also known as ""pads"" on the map. They serve as nodes for the Architect to appear at after teleporting out. Destroying all 4 is required to fight the Architect normally.
[[Heading:3]]Singularity Gate[[/Heading]]
A large and fragile machine on the left side of the map. If this machine is intact when the Architect is destroyed, a countdown of 10 turns will begin. If Cogmind is still on the map and the gate is not destroyed in that timeframe, Cogmind will be instantly destroyed. It is possible to activate the machine by performing the Gate Test 138-A and Gate Test 138-B hacks. This will an approximately 5 tile radius singularity that draws bots and parts in and destroys them instantly if the center is reached. This singularity will stop if the gate is destroyed. The Architect will intentionally target the gate to break it while in this state. The Gate Test 138-END will shut down the singularity. One additional hack, 138-C, requires the [[A2 Data Core]] which can be achieved by destroying A2. Performing this hack will immediately end the run and result in a [[Wintypes|W5 Wintype]]. If the singularity gate is still intact when the Architect is destroyed, the gate will be activated and can not be shut down by normal means. Cogmind must exit the map within 10 turns or destroy the singularity gate or else Cogmind will be instantly destroyed. If Cogmind exits the map while the countdown is going off, this will result a W6 wintype.
[[Heading:3]]Architect Logs[[/Heading]]
The Architect shell has 120 armor and is extremely difficult to break through by force. However, defeating the Architect will drop the [[Architect Data Core]] which will result in the shell retracting and revealing the inner Terminal that contains a large number of unique lore entries.
[[Heading:3]]Dimensional Slip Node[[/Heading]]
There is a Dimensional Slip node installed near the top of the map. Using a [[Transdimensional Reconstructor|regular]] or [[Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor]] will always go to this location. An exit is a few tiles away from this spot. If the Architect is still alive when Cogmind appears here, the log message [[GameText]]I have more important things to do than play hide-and-seek. Deal with this piece of junk if it returns.[[/GameText]] will appear, and the Architect will disappear off of the map and will not return.

[[Heading:2]]Caches[[/Heading]]There are several types of caches in Access_0, although they all draw from the same pool of potential items. This pool contains all rating 6-9 [[Prototype Part|Prototype]] parts accessible normally in 0b10 in stockpiles. It does not include any unique parts such as items found in [[Testing]] shells. These Prototype parts will never be faulty.
[[Heading:2]]Alien Artifacts[[/Heading]]
There are typically multiple Alien Artifacts held in 40 armor Workstation machines. If there are any, one will be guaranteed to be a Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor. The full list of available Alien Artifacts are:
[[List]][[Core Expander]]|[[Core Regenerator]]|[[Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor]]|[[Integrated Dissipator]]|[[Integrated Mediator]]|[[Integrated Reactor]]|[[Integrity Redistributor]]|[[Sigix Broadsword]][[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]There is a single exit in Access_0. A [[Surface]] exit is buried behind several dozen tiles of earth near the top of the map. It can be accessed via the Dimensional Slip Node by using a regular or Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor or by digging deep into the earth.
[[Heading]]Special bots[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:2]]The [[Architect]][[/Heading]]
The Architect is the true final boss of Cogmind. It has a multitude of strong offensive and defensive parts, resistances to most common damage types, 400 core, innate core and part regeneration, perfect always-active tracking on Cogmind's position, and a whopping 28 speed to top it all off. There is also a unique mechanic where the Architect will teleport to a nearby Subspace Access Node under various conditions. This includes: falling to 80% of core integrity (320/400), losing 2/3 Modified Sigix Shearguns, or becoming overweight. It will always have perfect tracking to Cogmind and never give up pursuit. It also has ""Behemoth AI"", where it will try to shoot Cogmind through several layers of tiles. This can be exploited by moving behind walls where repeated shots will take out wall tiles instead of hitting Cogmind.
The Architect can not be destroyed by most methods unless all 4 of the subspace access nodes are destroyed first. The one exception to this rule is that dealing 400 core damage in a single turn can destroy the Architect. While technically possible with a large enough weapon volley, this method of killing is primarily reserved to a few unique weapons, like the [[BFG-9k Vortex Edition]], the [[L-Cannon]], a [[Sigix Exoskeleton]]-boosted [[Core Cannon]], or 2 Core Cannons.
[[Heading:3]]Special Weapon Interactions[[/Heading]]
There are a few weapons that have special interactions with the Architect.
[[Heading:4]][[Sigix Terminator]]/[[Supercharged Sigix Terminator]][[/Heading]]
Using either of these weapons will cause the Architect to wrap to the nearest subspace node, resulting in the log message [[GameText]]I'm all too familiar with what that does.[[/GameText]] This effect will only occur if one or more subspace nodes are intact. Due to the way the Architect teleports, it is possible to hit it with the explosion, but only if the pad that the Architect teleports to is within range. This can be used to take out the last pad and land a hit on the Architect at the same time.
[[Heading:4]][[L-Cannon]][[/Heading]]
Similar to the terminators, it is not possible to hit the Architect with the L-Cannon unless the subspace nodes are all destroyed. The log message [[GameText]]I'm aware you stole the capacitor, you know...[[/GameText]] will accompany the Architect teleporting to the nearest subspace node. Even if the nodes are taken down, destroying the singularity gate is required before using the L-Cannon for the killing blow. Otherwise Cogmind will be crushed in the 10 turn countdown since the weapon itself takes 10 turns of delay after firing.
[[Heading:3]]Self-destruct codes[[/Heading]]
If any Enhanced bots or A bots are assimilated by disruption and rewiring or via the [[Field Lobotomy Kit]] and the Architect spots them, a log message [[GameText]]Architect flashes a signal at [Bot Name].[[/GameText]] will appear, and the bot will self-destruct. Bots that self-destruct will drop loot normally according to their salvage. This usually results in some pretty large loot pile explosions, especially for some of the lower numbered A bots. Although these bots cannot be used as allies, assimilation is a good way to let the Architect get rid of them rather than fighting them yourself.
[[Heading:3]]Defeat[[/Heading]]
The Architect is a sore loser. If destroyed, the Singularity Gate will be activated (if intact) and trigger a 10 turn countdown. Cogmind must either use a Transdimensional Reconstructor and escape out the exit at the top of the map near the Slip Node or destroy the Gate machine within these 10 turns to avoid instant death.
[[Heading:2]][[A bots]][[/Heading]]
The A bots are a series of very powerful and unique enemies, most of which only appearing in Access_0 or are allies on other maps. A8 appears at the entrance to the map and A2 guards the ""bridge"" to the left side of the map. [[A7]] does not appear on this map at all. Other than that, [[A6]], [[A5]], [[A4]], and [[A3]] all appear after Cogmind has explored a certain percentage of the map. They appear at roughly 10-15%, 25-30%, 45-50%, and 70-75% map exploration respectively. This is only affected by tiles seen by Cogmind and not other forms of intel such as drones or terrain scanning. If A8 was destroyed in [[Zion]], or A5 was in [[Lab]], they will not appear in Access_0. All A bots also maintain perfect tracking on Cogmind and can not be shaken forever.
[[Heading:2]][[Enhanced Programmer|Enhanced Programmers]][[/Heading]]
Enhanced Programmers are a unique type of bot that can show up in Access_0, but only under certain conditions. Using the [[Data Miner|Data Miner's]] [[Data Conduit]] or bringing more than 2 combat allies (bots with weapons) into the map will trigger these bots to spawn. They are extremely tough bots with many resistances and carry an [[Imp. Energy Mantle]] that will shield other allies. They will roam around the map as lone patrol bots.
[[Heading]]Unlockable Architect Logs[[/Heading]]
Similar to the Lab orders, there are some unique lore entries in the Architect Logs that can only be obtained by performing specific actions before that point. To read these logs, Cogmind must either defeat the Architect or have a strong enough weapon to break through the 120 armor shell that also doesn't break the frail Terminal inside it.
[[List]]Log L.L98W4A5V: Use the Data Miner's Data Conduit.
|Log L.MJH3MJHF: Save [[Revision 17]] in [[Cetus]] by defeating all of the [[Cetus Guard|Cetus Guards]]. Revision 17 must die before Cogmind exits the map.
|Log L.NV345OIG: Save Revision 17 in Cetus while keeping the manufacturing module intact and exiting while Revision 17 is still alive, triggering the -3 Revision 17 invasion event. Revision 17 must also survive until Cogmind exits the map on -3.

|Log L.VFLK3RLK: Ally with Warlord at his base and Warlord must survive the -2 assault.
|Log L.WEK5AVLJ: Ally with Warlord at his base and Warlord must die at the -2 assault.[[/List]]
[[Heading]]Getting the Architect's + Strategy (defeating the Architect)[[/Heading]]
Access_0 is an especially tough map in Cogmind, arguably the toughest to defeat. It typically relies on Cogmind single-handedly dealing with a myriad of threats on the map with little breathing room for fixing a build that is starting to fall apart. Assuming MAIN.C is defeated in Command, there is a large amount of preparation that can be done after all of the bots have turned off. MAIN.C's cache can provide some incredibly powerful parts, and the rest of the map can have plenty of goodies to grab. Since Access_0 is a very combat-oriented map, make sure to bring backups of essentials like power, propulsion, weapons, and armor. While there are some part caches in Access_0 itself, their contents are not super reliable and shouldn't be relied on to fix a build. More consistent are the drops from the Enhanced bots and the A bots, assuming weapons with neutral salvage can be used at least some of the time. There tend to be abundant legs and mediocre-quality power above all else from the Grunts and Hunters. The Grunt's [[Neutron Cannon|Neutron Cannons]] can serve in a pinch, but aren't incredibly strong.
All propulsion types can be used in Access_0, although some are definitely better suited than others. Hover and legs are nice middle ground propulsion that can have a lot of power and still retain maneuverability. Treads are the best heavy combat type with lots of coverage and integrity but may get stuck fighting in bad situations with no good way to reposition. Wheels are a little more niche than treads due to the rarity of good wheel propulsion types. Flight is the easiest to use to take down all of the pads but can struggle the most to finish off the Architect in the final fight.
[[Heading:2]]Flight[[/Heading]]
Flight builds should be extremely quick at this point in the game (sub 20 speed) and are able to outrun every bot on the map. Flight does not have the integrity for prolonged fighting and typically wants to destroy the pads first and then try to lure the Architect away from all of the other bots for a quick kill. Evasion utilities work especially well to minimize the number of attacks that land. A Shield Generator or Force Field also work well, but may be tough to support. A bots are a major threat to this playstyle, as their remote force fields can draw out the final encounter to the point that Cogmind is unable to finish off the Architect. Critical weapons can be good for taking out a few enhanced bots or removing hover units off of key A bots so they don't catch up as quickly for the final fight. A strong final Architect-killer weapon is a must for this strategy. [[ECM Suites]] can be used to take a little pressure off of the mass of bots that end up following any flight build.
[[Heading:2]]Hover[[/Heading]]
Hover builds tend to be the hardest to put together but can end up with a good mix of speed, offensive, and defensive capabilities. Using a [[Zio. Metafield Generator]] or [[ST Field Compressor]] can help to outrun groups of bots or reposition more easily. However, a strategy entirely based on running away tends to fare much worse for hover builds due to the lower speed and ability to get trapped by inability to hop in some tight 1 tile corridors. Hover builds should choose their fights carefully and can reposition in combat to avoid getting outnumbered.
[[Heading:2]]Legs[[/Heading]]
Leg builds finally start to trend into the area where having a reliable way to ""shoo"" (deal 80 core damage to trigger the teleport) the Architect is a requirement. While legs can take advantage of the movement bonuses to dodge (5/10/15 extra evasion per tile moved in a row) and can avoid most of the shuts while running in a straight line for a while, they can still take a lot of times trying to move into a better fighting spot constantly. Legs builds need to be reasonably offensively focused. Infowar like terrain scanning or drones can help locate the pads quicker and reduce total attrition taken from the Architect coming back repeatedly. One option for legs is a ""siege legs"" build, where an extra pair of treads are used in addition to the standard legs. This requires 2 extra propulsion slots above what Cogmind already needs to support for the full effect. Being overweight on legs is not ideal in Access_0. The benefits of this strategy are that the Enhanced Hunters can't continually knock Cogmind back into collapsed tiles due to the knockback cancellation ability of treads, and siege mode can be used for tough encounters. The treads also have higher coverage than legs even when not sieged and can take a little more damage.
[[Heading:2]]Wheels/Treads[[/Heading]]
Wheels and treads are the slowest Access_0 propulsion types, and as such need to be the most prepared for heavy combat. Lots of armor and strong weaponry are required for these builds. Wheel builds tend to have lower propulsion slots and higher utility slots, necessitating more utility slots being taken up by armor to compensate. Treads usually have 6-8 propulsion slots and can afford to run less armor in utility slots due to the higher propulsion coverage. Terrain scanning and drones are especially recommended for these builds to reduce the pad finding time. They will end up needing to shoo the Architect repeatedly throughout the level and fight every bot they meet.
[[Heading:2]][[Sigix Exoskeleton]][[/Heading]]
The Exoskeleton plays a little differently from the other propulsion types. Due to its incredible amount of builtin infowar, it is quite easy to find and destroy all of the Architect's pads. With the Sigix Shearcannon it is quite easy to destroy every bot on the map in a few volleys. A Core Cannon can also kill the Architect from full integrity which allows skipping the pad destroying altogether. With weaker weapons than those, the Exoskeleton tends to play like a hover build without much shooing power, taking a few specific encounters and killing A bots but mostly running from the Architect in favor of searching and destroying the pads first before finding a good location for the final fight.
[[Heading:2]]Key Weapon Roles[[/Heading]]
Some weapon types excel at some situations and not in others. Entropic, Kinetic, Pierce, Slashing, Thermal, Vortex damage-dealing weapons all tend to be good all-around in Access_0. Electromagnetic damage is decent in a few key places, while Impact and Explosive damage tend to be subpar. However, there are some particularly useful weapons for specific circumstances. Ratings below include (-) = not suitable for role, (~) = passable for role, (+) = good for role, (++) = great for role. Ratings are a combination of how good the weapon is at killing something, its + or - salvage potential, and resource costs of use.

A [[Desublimator]] or other matter regenerating utilities are recommended to allow Multirails to shoo over a long period of time.|The Sigix Shearcannon has incredible firepower but it comes with a caveat. Cogmind must typically be within 2-4 tiles of the target in order to gain maximum damage potential. Otherwise the weapon's arc will cause some projectiles to miss, with higher percentages of projectiles missing at further distances. This weapon is best suited for faster propulsion types, although even treads can make good use if it in some situations.|Vortex weaponry is quite powerful and good at killing all in Access_0. However, it is not good to use for fighting everything as they have limited usages. A bots and the final Architect kill tend to be the most important uses.|These launchers have very strong killing power and Architect shooing potential. However, the incredibly high matter cost makes them not a good choice for regular usage. One or two [[Prc. Matter Filter|Prc. Matter Filters]] along with a Desublimator may make this a more reliable option, but it may be a bad idea to rely too heavily on launchers without other good options due to the risk of running out of matter entirely.|The Alpha Cannon Mk. II does not need any particle charging in some situations but does in others. It naturally kills 120 integrity Enhanced Grunts/Hunters in 2 hits with its base 65 damage. A bots and Enhanced Sentries have 150 core integrity which takes 3 hits. However, an Adv. Particle Charger ups the damage to 81. This turns those 3 hits into a 2 hit kill. This also matters for the Architect, where 81 damage will guarantee the shoo on a single core hit instead of requiring 2 hits.[[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]Other useful parts[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:3]]Targeting[[/Heading]]
Specifically, [[Adv. Targeting Computer|Adv.]] or [[Exp. Targeting Computer]] or [[Asb. Combat Suite]], for ranged combat, [[Adv. Melee Analysis Suite|Adv.]] or [[Exp. Melee Analysis Suite]] for melee. Targeting is the most important combat utility to use in Access_0. The Architect and Enhanced Hunters all run [[Exp. Phase Shifter|Exp. Phase Shifters]] which dramatically reduce chance to hit ranged attacks. Running at least 2 targeting utilities is extremely recommended to maintain a high chance to hit.
[[Heading:3]]Core chance to hit boosters[[/Heading]]
Specifically, [[Core Analyzer|Regular]] or [[Exp. Core Analyzer]] or Asb. Combat Suite and [[Imp. Armor Integrity Analyzer|Imp.]] or [[Exp. Armor Integrity Analyzer]]. Next to targeting, the best offensive utilities to use. Core Analyzer is superior, but they both work together and an Armor Integrity Analyzer should be used over the second Core Analyzer if there is space.
[[Heading:3]][[Weapon Cyclers]]/[[Actuators]][[/Heading]]
Weapon cycling is another great way to increase the damage done. Keep in mind they do require extra weapon energy/heat upkeep as the full volley will be fired more quickly than without. A [[Quantum Capacitor]] is good for any single powerful energy cannon, especially ones that can shoo the Architect in a single core hit.
[[Heading:3]][[Kinecellerators]]/[[Particle Chargers]][[/Heading]]
Nearly mandatory for some weapon types and less important for others. In some cases, like with the Omega Cannon and an Adv. Kinecellerator, it can be the difference between a single core hit Architect shoo and a double core hit Architect shoo.
[[Heading:3]][[Shield Generators/Force Fields|Force Fields]][[/Heading]]
Force fields are the best way to reduce damage in the game as long as their energy demands can be met. Airborne propulsion may want to use Shield Generators for their lesser energy requirements and lighter mass.
[[Heading:3]][[Phase Shifters]]/[[Reaction Control Systems]][[/Heading]]
All around good ways to reduce damage taken. Reaction Control Systems can only effectively be used by airborne propulsion types and legs.
[[Heading:3]][[Microwarp Drive]][[/Heading]]
This is especially useful for grounded propulsion types. The Microwarp Drive can be used to travel large distances very quickly in order to get to a specific pad location, reposition for a fight, or even just move around much quicker than normal. The core cost is prohibitive for constant warping, but this item can save a lot on overall build attrition with good use.
[[Heading:3]]Scouting Infowar[[/Heading]]
Specifically, [[Terrain Scanners]] with [[Terrain Scan Processors]], [[Drone Bays]], [[Visual Processing Units]] or [[Structural Scanner]]. All of these provide extra map intel which can be used for locating pads more easily or finding shortcut digs that can be taken. The Structural Scanner is more useful for airborne propulsion than grounded propulsion since it works instantly and can be used to dodge groups of hostiles if running away. It doesn't typically help find the pads sooner like the others.
[[Heading:3]][[ECM Suites]][[/Heading]]
For airborne propulsion only. This can help take some pressure off by causing groups of followers to much more quickly lose tracking of Cogmind.
[[Heading:3]][[Triangulator]][[/Heading]]
This typically niche item has a unique ability in that it allows for tracking hostiles at 24 range even if they can't be seen via other sensor methods. The Architect has scan cloak 5 which prevents all other detection methods. Using the Triangulator can pinpoint the way the Architect is coming from at long range which can greatly help in determining pad locations.
[[Heading:3]]Matter generating utilities[[/Heading]]
Specifically, [[Desublimator]], [[Field Recycling Units]], [[Matter Filters]], [[Tractor Beams]], and [[Matter Compressors]] .For any kinetic based weapons or weapons that cause a lot of negative salvage like the Potential Cannons, having ways of stockpiling matter or restocking up on matter mid-map can be entirely essential to avoid losing the run due to running out of matter. The Desublimator can be found off of Enhanced Hunters only on this map, but the others can be brought over from earlier maps.
[[Heading:3]]Energy support[[/Heading]]
Specifically, [[Energy Wells]], [[Power Amplifiers]], and [[Energy Filters]]. All of these utilities can be used to maintain expensive energy cannons and force fields through prolonged combat. Energy wells can be dropped on the ground to instantly absorb the energy needed to keep firing, while the others must be attached to help.
[[Heading:3]]Remote [[Datajacks]][[/Heading]]
If the Data Conduit is used, Cogmind will be given intel for instant kill codes for all A bots that must be used with a Remote Datajack.
[[Heading:3]][[Terrabomb]][[/Heading]]
Although a little niche, Terrabombs do great at opening up a large part of the map to check for nearby pads. This is a double-edged sword since any nearby groups of enemies will spot you instantly, and the Architect can potentially start shooting from out of weapon range.
[[Heading:3]][[Sigix Terminator|Regular]] or [[Supercharged Sigix Terminator]][[/Heading]]
This single-use weapon is best used after taking down all of the pads in order to kill or at least severely cripple the Architect for the final fight. If airborne, this can also be used to kill off a lot of the bots following behind in a big mass.
[[Heading:3]]Regular or Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor[[/Heading]]
There is almost always one of these on the map somewhere and the Architect drops one when defeated. This can be an issue if defeating the Architect with a weapon with knockback like a kinetic cannon because it may be dropped too far away to pick up to exit the map in time. Also, keeping a spare is a way to escape with a non-Architect killing win if all hope is lost instead of dying in Access_0.
[[Heading:3]][[Core Reset Matrix]][[/Heading]]
There are several Alien Artifacts on the map and using the Core Reset Matrix ahead of time allows for locating them right away on entering the map. Sometimes being able to head for a Core Regenerator or Integrity Redistributor right away after entering the map is the difference between a loss and a win.
[[Heading:3]][[Integrity Redistributor]][[/Heading]]
Useful to prevent essential parts of the build from breaking or just generally to repair everything at once. Things with a limited but very high value such as shieldings or non-regenerative armor like [[Zio. Shade Armor]] or [[Exp. Powered Armor]] should be taken off preemptively at low integrity in order to use a Redistributor on them at a later time.
[[Heading:3]][[Core Regenerator]][[/Heading]]
Most helpful if using core-hungry Alien Artifacts like the Core Cannon, Microwarp Drive, or an Integrity Redistributor. It provides 400 (or more core with [[LRC Armor]] that can be used as more fuel. Sometimes it is better to use before entering the map if core is low enough.
[[Heading:3]][[Navigation Efficiency Matrix]][[/Heading]]
While this artifact can be very painful to use from the random teleportation, it does have some good usages in Access_0. When teleporting, all of the Enhanced bots lose tracking on Cogmind. This can be used on airborne propulsion to avoid getting large groups of Enhanced bots following behind, or on grounded propulsion to attempt to reposition or even avoid fighting groups of enemies. It is a mixed bag since it can just as easily teleport Cogmind into an even worse position than before.
[[Heading:2]]Stages of the map[[/Heading]]
There are several distinct stages of the map where different strategies can be used. Some playstyles may skip certain stages entirely, like how a flight build will typically not stick around for the initial map fight, while grounded propulsion builds will have to fight.
[[Heading:3]]Initial fight[[/Heading]]
Cogmind is confronted by the Architect, A8, and 2 dormant Enhanced Grunts. Rarely, a patrol of more Enhanced Grunts or Enhanced Hunters spawns close enough to also join in here. Flight will typically ignore this part and skip straight to hunting for the pads to destroy. Hover can kill all the bots and shoo the Architect right away or move deeper into the level and try to fight the bots one-on-one instead. Grounded propulsion usually need to fight right at the starting position, so be prepared with strong weaponry to begin with. Siege up right at the entrance of the map if using treads. Targeting the Architect for a shoo is usually the best approach, followed by A8, and finally the Enhanced Grunts. If lacking any good Architect shooing weapons, focusing A8 first may be preferable so A8's Remote Force Field won't be able to protect the Architect.
[[Heading:3]]Searching for the pads[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Access_0 Subspace Access Node.png|Subspace Access Node layout[[/Image]]
This stage is where the vast majority of the time spent in Access_0. This part involves running or actively fighting the Architect, Enhanced bot guards and patrols, and the A bots as they appear. Infowar utilities are most useful at this time. The general strategy for combat here is to shoo the Architect and then start heading in the direction that it came from. Since it typically comes from the closest pad, that is the best way to get in the right general area. If multiple pads are close by, this can be difficult as the Architect can start spawning at different pads and coming at different directions. Infowar is best to help find the pads in this situation, but if none is available then making a guess at the pad location and heading there is better than getting stuck moving back and forth in a loop, failing to get anywhere.
When using terrain scanning, there are often telltale signs of a pad even before getting the whole area scanned. Any of the 4 inner tiles or the 4 surrounding cyan tiles are very recognizable. The white tiles surrounding the machine are also not guaranteed to lead to a pad, but they are good to investigate. Finally, pads are always found at the end of 2 tile corridors. Following 2 tile paths can be a good way to get to the final pad location.
Drone Bays and especially Terrain Scanners tend to have high coverage and not the most impressive integrity. They should usually be swapped out during any prolonged combat encounters for offensive utilities or better armor. With a good shooing weapon, it may not be necessary to swap out every time the Architect comes. Making sure these important utilities don't get destroyed early can be very important. If using drones, the best time to release them is just before or right after the Architect teleports away. That gives them the maximum amount of time to explore before the Architect gets a chance to attack them.
If using the Data Conduit, finding the pads is easy since all the machines are revealed on entering the map. However, the additional Enhanced Programmer patrols can be a huge pain even when knowing exactly where to go. Make sure to have a good answer to these Programmers.
Most of the A bots are fairly similar in overall strategy to fight. Most have remote force fields that shield allies, so the A bots are a high priority to take out first. EM is ineffective against all of them except for A6, for which EM is the best solution. Generally any other damage type is fine for taking out the rest of them. Core Stripper and Disintegrator are uniquely good for killing some of the A bots because they guarantee (or nearly guarantee) full salvage of all parts.
[[Heading:3]]Destroying the Singularity Gate (optional)[[/Heading]]
Destroying the gate is an optional action that needs to be done in order to obtain any Architect Logs lore unless there is another way in. Otherwise, the singularity will crush Cogmind before there is enough time to get the lore. The gate is on the left side of the map and A2 is on the way. The gate itself is very fragile and just about any weapon will destroy it easily. It is best to get rid of nearby pads on the right side of the map before crossing the bridge so the Architect takes longer to get to Cogmind's location. After that, take the trek back to finish off the final pad and the Architect.
[[Heading:3]]The final pad[[/Heading]]
After all the other pads are destroyed, the Architect will continually teleport back to the last pad. This can be frustrating for grounded propulsion, where after being shooed the Architect will return after only a few moves as you get closer and closer. At a certain point, it is best to ignore the Architect and just walk by until the last pad is destroyed. Faster propulsion types have an easier time of doing this, and the Microwarp Drive can help a lot here. Putting on evasion utilities helps to reduce the damage taken during this last walk.
[[Heading:3]]The final fight[[/Heading]]
After all this, the Architect can finally be fought normally. For grounded builds, siege up with any treads if you have them, then start fighting to the death. Frailer airborne builds might need to lure the bulk of the pursuers to one corner of the map and then take the Architect to the other side of the map to avoid getting overwhelmed.
[[Heading:3]]Escape/cleaning up[[/Heading]]
After the Architect is destroyed, the Singularity Gate will be triggered if it is still intact and a 10 turn countdown will trigger. Grounded builds may need to be close to the Architect if relying on the Transdimensional Reconstructor that it drops. Otherwise the singularity countdown will kill Cogmind on the escape. Most grounded propulsion builds will need to detach all parts and core hover to equip the Reconstructor and to the exit if this happens. Airborne propulsion usually have enough time to get to the exit without needing to do this.
If the gate is destroyed, however, you are free to take your time to clean up any stragglers on the map and exit whenever. Get the Architect Data Core and head to the bottom-left corner of the map to open up the Architect Logs Terminal and obtain any new lore. Exploring the rest of the map will cause all remaining A bots to spawn as normal. The A bots and any other remaining Enhanced bots can be fought for extra points."

"Achievements","Other","There are currently 256 achievements in Cogmind, which can be viewed in-game through the Achievements records submenu. They are divided into several categories organized by color, with the appearance of their borders sometimes providing additional information. 81 of the 256 Achievements have hidden descriptions that are only revealed after completing them.

Visually, Achievements are tile-based 5x5 squares. While an Achievement is locked, the inner 3x3 square is made out of question marks. Unlocking an Achievement changes the inner 3x3 square to visually represent the Achievement's requirements/results. The tiles on the border of the 5x5 square almost never change when the Achievement is unlocked. [[Comment]]Those achievements are ""Stardust"" and ""Planet Killer"". this is because Wins Achievements' inner art isn't a square but more of a cog, so some of the outer border tiles are part of said art, even if it's just a matching background. This dark green background is the same for all Wins Achievements, except those two. The locked versions, however, still have that dark green background.[[/Comment]]

"Alert","Other","Alert is an underlying mechanic throughout the game that describes Cogmind's apparent threat level to [[0b10]]. It only comes into play in 0b10-controlled maps, primarily on main floors like [[Materials]] or [[Factory]] or a few 0b10 branches. It can be increased by many ways, most often by getting spotted or destroying bots or parts of the level. Alert does naturally dissipate over time, although combat-oriented strategies will almost always generate much more alert than the dissipation rate.
Alert is normally hidden throughout the game, although it can be revealed through a few different ways. [[RIF]]-alignment gives a permanent influence number and alert level indicator on the UI at all times. The [[0b10 Alert Chip]] gives the same indication when equipped. Additionally, alert level can be checked by using the [[GameText]]check_alert[[/GameText]] hack when using a [[Datajacks|Datajack]] on an [[Operator]], or by using the [[GameText]]Alert(Check)[[/GameText]] hack at a [[Terminal]].
There are 2 aspects of the Alert level. The first is the ""influence"" number, which is the numeric representation of alert. This can only be seen when using RIF or the Alert Chip. The other, the alert level, is an approximation of the influence. Low security is the lowest level of alert when the influence number is less than 200 and does not have any additional information. However, alert levels 1 through 4 are all divided into 26 alphabetical subsections. For example, alert level 1 begins at 200 and ends at 399 influence. Checking the alert level while at 200 influence will report ""1-A"", and checking at 399 will report ""1-Z"". This can be used to approximate the influence number, although the exact number does not really matter.
[[Heading]]Alert levels[[/Heading]]
[[Table]]Alert level|Minimum Value|Maximum Value||Low Security|0|199||1|200|399||2|400|699||3|700|1199||4|1200|1599||5|1600|No Max[[/Table]]
Alert level controls only a few aspects of the game: [[Assault Squad|Assaults]], [[Patrol Squad|Searches]], and [[High Security]]. Alert level does not increase the number of patrols or guards on the map in any way. Alert below level 2 does not have any impact on the game. At alert level 2/400 influence, Assaults and [[Search Patrol|Search Patrols]] can start being dispatched. From this point onward, alert is a sliding scale. Increased alert will also increase the overall frequency of Assaults and the number of [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]] that will be dispatched as part of an Assault. Alert level 2 typically only sends a single ARC per Assault wave, but higher alert levels can see two or more being sent frequently.
[[High Security]] is the other affect of alert. It is a special alert level that can only be triggered when at level 5 alert when combat hostiles are destroyed. The higher the influence value, the higher the chance of triggering High Security. [[Maximum Security]] has similar effects as High Security, but is not related to alert except that it sets influence to 1600 if it is lower than that.
[[Heading]]Ways to raise alert[[/Heading]]

[[List:Ordered]]Successful hacking increases alert more if the hack is less likely to succeed. Alert does not increase at all from hacks with a success rate of >= 30%.[[/List]]
There are also modifiers that can affect how much alert is gained by a certain percentage. The 0b10 Alert Chip reduces all influence gains by 20%, and the RIF ability Threat Obfuscation reduces all gains by 25%, 40%, or 50% depending on level. All alert reduction is rounded down, and reduction will not take place unless the value is at least 1. For example, gaining 3 influence from destroying a wall on -2 with the Alert Chip equipped results in 0.6 reduction which rounds down to 0. With this 20% reduction, only influence gains of 5 or more will have any reduction applied. On the other hand, having blue or purple allies within a 20-tile radius will increase alert gain from destroying bots. The gain is roughly 12.5% per ally, capping out at an additional 100% alert gain at 8 nearby allies. This effect can be cancelled out by the RIF ability Alert ID Control. In general, be cautious of taking large groups of allies into combat or else alert can quite easily skyrocket.
[[Heading]]Ways to lower alert[[/Heading]]
Lowering alert tends to be quite a bit more difficult than gaining it in the first place for most builds. The best way to dissipate large amounts of alert is to exit the map, as a large percentage of current alert is taken away immediately. Going into [[Caves]] in [[Factory]] branches is even better. By the end of several Caves maps, alert will most likely have dropped down to 0. This alert reduction effect lessens the higher up Cogmind is in the complex, and the amount varies depending on whether Cogmind is exiting into a branch map or a new main depth. Some maps always have fixed alert reduction percentages regardless of floor.

[[Heading:2]]Passive alert reduction[[/Heading]]
The most substantial alert reduction method aside from exiting the map is a passive alert reduction over time. Every 400 turns, influence will decrease by a diminishing value that starts at 200. Each time alert is reduced, the value decreases by 25%.
[[Table]]Turn|Alert influence reduction|Cumulative reduction||400|200|200||800|150|350||1200|112|462||1600|84|546||2000|63|609||2400|47|656||2800|35|691||3200|26|717||3600|19|736||4000|14|750||4400|10|760||4800|7|767||5200|5|772||5600|3|775||6000|2|777||6400|1|778[[/Table]]
[[Heading:2]]Other alert influence reduction[[/Heading]]
There are a few other miscellaneous ways of decreasing alert:
[[Table]]Method|Alert influence reduction||Cogmind part destroyed by combat hostile|10||Non-combat ally destroyed by combat hostile|10||Combat ally destroyed by combat hostile|20||Alert(Purge) [[Terminal]] hack|150||purge_threat [[Operator]] RIF hack|150 [[Sub]]1[[/Sub]][[/Table]]
[[List:Ordered]]Each purge_threat hack reduces the amount of influence reduced by 25 until the minimum value of 50 is reached. So purging will reduce by 150, 125, 100, 75, and remain at 50. This number resets back to 150 with each new map.[[/List]]"
"Alien Artifact","Other",""
"Alignment","Other","Alignments are a major part of Cogmind's journey each run. They can provide unique capabilities or trigger certain events, but often lock other pieces of content out as inaccessible. Some factions change large aspects of Cogmind's normal interaction with the game world, while others only trigger a specific event in the game. Some can provide unique [[Wintypes]]. Selecting factions wisely is an important part of a run.
[[Heading]]List of alignments[[/Heading]]
[[List]][[Core Reset Matrix]] (CRM), [[Sigix]] alignment: The CRM is a lategame consumable [[Alien Artifact]] that provides a variety of unique abilities, with the most substantial benefit being the instant detection of all other Alien Artifacts upon consumption or entering a new map. The major downside is a memory wipe that removes most of Cogmind's knowledge. Consuming it also angers a few other factions and locks out certain events.|[[Farcom]], [[Exiles (Group)|Exiles]] alignment: An early game alignment that provides a permanent 18-tile radius combat bot sensor in all [[0b10]]-controlled floors as well as 1 type of unique Exile prototype. Its major downsides are locking out Imprint and a harsh penalty when entering [[Research]] branches [[Testing]], [[Quarantine]], and [[Section 7]].|[[Imprint]], [[Zion]] alignment: A midgame alignment that dramatically changes [[Terminal]] hacking. All standard Terminal hacks are removed and replaced with special random Zion ally summons and intel. Imprint is a powerful but tricky alignment to use due to the loss of standard Terminal hacking. Imprinting also locks Cogmind out of gaining the aid of several other Derelict factions.|[[Redacted]][[MAIN.C]] surrender - 0b10 alignment: This lategame alignment only becomes available in [[Command]] after defeating the [[MAIN.C (Shell)|MAIN.C Shell]] and enables a particular win, w8 by fighting off waves of [[Enhanced Q-Series]]. Surrendering to MAIN.C locks Cogmind out of several ending types, as well as the ability to enter [[Access_0]].[[/Redacted]]|[[Relay Interface Framework]] (RIF), 0b10 alignment: An alignment available as early as [[Materials]], RIF allows for much greater control of 0b10 complex bots through the use of special hacks via [[Relay Couplers]]. RIF also provides many unique abilities that make traversing the complex safer or easier. The major downside of RIF is that several [[Derelict]] factions will be unable to identify Cogmind as friendly and will instead turn hostile.|[[Revision 17 (Alignment)|Revision 17 Alignment]]: [[Revision 17]] is a quite unique Derelict that can be rescued in [[Cetus]]. Revision 17's role is not a large one, but its -3 Research invasion can stir up some trouble and hopefully provide some aid in Research.|[[Redacted]][[Sigix Exoskeleton]], Sigix alignment: The Sigix Exoskeleton is an immensely powerful and gamechanging build type available late in the game in Section 7. It provides Cogmind with lots of firepower, a massive amount of map intel, and fast and high integrity and coverage exoskeleton part. The downsides to the Exoskeleton are reduced slot count (down to 1-3-3-2 initially), a decently low maximum support, and the full weight of 0b10's [[Maximum Security]] sent after Cogmind whenever spotted. This item is very powerful, but drastically changes gameplay for the rest of the run compared to most other alignments.[[/Redacted]]|[[UFD|United Federation of Derelicts]] alignment: The UFD is a Derelict group whose home is in the 0b1 Old Recycling map [[Scraptown]]. Their major benefits include some unique parts available on the map and their ability to summon [[Scrapoid|Scrapoids]] from [[Recycling Machine|Recycling Machines]].|[[Warlord (Alignment)|Warlord Alignment]]: [[Warlord]] is a unique and much beloved Derelict that wages war on 0b10 whose help can be obtained in the midgame. His -2 Research assault is similar to Revision 17's but on a much grander scale. Lots of loot can be found wherever Warlord goes. He can also make an appearance in the [[Redacted]][[Command]] cave seals[[/Redacted]], which can even lead to a unique wintype. The [[Encrypted Comm Array]] also falls under this alignment and turns destruction of 0b10 [[Garrison|Garrisons]] and [[DSF|DSFs]] into more powerful Warlord forces.|[[Zhirov (Alignment)|Zhirov Alignment]]: [[Zhirov]] is another unique Derelict who can provide a big help in the lategame. Grabbing the [[SGEMP Prototype]] in Testing provides a few temporary allies (including Zhirov himself) and full map intel of [[Access]], a notoriously difficult map. His quest can continue on in [[Redacted]]Command, where his Modified SGEMP can disable the whole map's worth of 0b10 bots when the MAIN.C Shell is defeated.[[/Redacted]][[/List]]

In seeds where this occurs, he will not be found in his normal [[Zhirov (Location)|location]] This variant is recognizable by the lack of Sentry guards and the Operators all being broken. In these variants, the Archive Hub machine closest to Zhirov can be decoded for some Lore records. Soon after speaking with Zhirov, the intrusion will be detected and a large amount of 0b10 bots will be sent to investigate. Don't join in the fight and instead grab the Terminal lore (if not gotten yet) and make a beeline for the exits. After a second wave of bots are sent, Zhirov and friends will teleport out and rig some explosives to go off soon. You don't want to get caught in the blast.[[/List]]

"Armory","Location","Armory is a [[0b10]]-controlled [[Factory]]/[[Research]] [[Branch]] that appears between -4 and -3. It is a tough map with tight corridors, few available paths, an above average number of patrols, and special dormant and guard bots. There are several unique types of patrols on this map as well, with a [[Demolisher]] leading a squad of [[Grunt|Grunts]] and [[Duelist]] squads with a [[Protector]] in tow. Stealth builds will have a difficult time of sneaking past unnoticed and combat hostiles must be ready to do a lot of killing to get by. If Cogmind can survive, some of the rewards are rewirable allies, a high number of [[Fabricator|Fabricators]], and large stockpiles of out-of-depth parts.
The overall map structure varies, but there are some common features of Armory maps. There are usually corridors running horizontally on the bottom and top of the map that contain large rooms next to each other connected by Emergency Access doors. The map can be a little maze-like although heading to the left and crossing from bottom to top or top to bottom will usually lead to an exit.
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
There is one type of special machine in Armory. The Energy Cycler is a large explosive machine that will open all Sealed Heavy Doors on the map and summon several patrols. These Sealed Heavy Doors have hackable Terminals and contain high rating part stockpiles, sometimes full of entirely non-faulty [[Prototype Part|Prototype Parts]].

[[Heading:2]]Disassembled Obliterator[[/Heading]]
There is a special portion of Armory near the left side of the map. This area is heavily guarded by 2 pairs of 2 Armor Guards, with many [[Stasis Trap|Stasis Traps]] getting in the way of entry. It is sealed off by 50 armor Sealed Blast doors that can be opened with a 30% success rate Terminal. The inner area has an unavoidable special alarm that triggers when entered.

"Assault Squad","Other","Assault squads are [[0b10]] aligned [[Squad|squads]] that are sent after Cogmind as a result of having too high [[Alert]]. Assaults are sent directly to Cogmind's position with [[Perfect Tracking]] and cannot be easily shaken. They consist of a single [[C-30 ARC]] typically containing 5 bots inside. If Cogmind has 3 or more allies, up to 2 additional bots may be sent to escort the ARC as additional firepower. Assault squads can be both Enumerated and Recalled at [[Terminal|Terminals]].
An alert indicates whenever an Assault squad is dispatched. Additionally, the log will display a message like [[GameText]]ALERT: Significant disruption in zone 9B, assault force dispatched[[/GameText]]. If more than one ARC was sent, the message will instead indicate [[GameText]]multiple assault carriers dispatched[[/GameText]].
[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]
[[Lore]]WAR.Sys Records|Assault Squad[[/Lore]]
[[Heading]]Frequency and Number[[/Heading]]
Assaults may be dispatched regularly as long as Cogmind is at least Alert level 2 or 400 influence, although at lower Alert levels Assaults are rare. At Alert levels well above 1000, Assaults may be sent out at nearly opportunity. A higher Alert level also increases the chances of multiple ARCs being dispatched. In [[Materials]], Assaults can be dispatched every 400 turns on -9 and -8. In [[Factory]] and above, this changes to be every 250 turns. If an Assault would be dispatched at the same time an [[Extermination Squad]] would be dispatched, the Assault is delayed by 50 turns. Most assault waves consists of 1-2 ARCs, but at Alert levels in excess of 5X/1600 influence, 3 or even more ARCs can be sent.
[[Heading:2]]During [[High Security|High]] or [[Maximum Security]][[/Heading]]
The frequency, number, and contents of ARCs changes. Assault forces with stronger compositions than usual may be dispatched in these conditions, although these ARCs only have 4 bots inside rather than the typical 5. 4 ARCs will be dispatched 100 turns into High Security and after another 100 turns. After that, 2 more ARCs will be added to each wave, but 50 more turns will be added in between the dispatch of each wave. The sizes of the Assault waves will also start to increase each wave, and the duration between each wave will increase. Maximum Security is similar, but with 6 ARCs to start the first 2 waves. The 2nd wave of Assaults in High Security and all subsequent waves, and all waves of Maximum Security may contain stronger than usual bots in them.
[[Heading]]Assault Contents[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Assault Contents.png|Example contents of an Assault squad ARC[[/Image]]
Assault contents can vary by depth, but their makeups are always similar. Assaults will always contain 4 combat bots and 1 support-type bot. The combat bots may become stronger under heavy assault conditions, but the possible support bots are always the same.

[[Spoiler]][[Heading]][[Data Miner]] redirection[[/Heading]]
The Data Miner can redirect Assaults if his help is obtained by visiting his [[Data Miner (Location)|hideout]]. If redirected, Assaults will roam around a random area of the map rather than head directly to Cogmind's location. The Data Miner has a 50% chance to direct each ARC as part of an Assault about 15 turns after each Assault is dispatched, if Cogmind is determined as ""needing assistance"". Redirection can only occur when High/Maximum Security is not active. If a redirect happens, the alert [[GameText]]Higher priority target acquired, redirecting assault.[[/GameText]] will be displayed. If an Assault is not redirected, there is a further 50% chance that the contents may be redirected after the ARC opens up. This can happen within 30 turns of the ARC opening. This effect will only redirect the squad leader, and the squad leader will only leave if currently unable to see Cogmind. All the remaining squad bots will continue to follow Cogmind. The true practical effect here is that if the squad forgets where Cogmind is, they will patrol around the redirected location rather than the location that the ARC opened.[[/Spoiler]]"

"Behemoth","Bot Group","Behemoths are a [[Bot Groups|Bot Group]] of heavily [[Armor|armored]] [[Treads|treading]] [[0b10]] bots that are much more durable and powerful than the majority of standard bots. They typically guard machines or valuable part stockpiles while sitting slightly indented in the wall. Similar to [[Hunter|Hunters]], Behemoths will fire through walls in order to hit an enemy, which makes it hard to hide or run from them. Behemoths can even make use of [[Siege Mode]] to become more accurate and durable in combat. These combination of traits can make Behemoths terrifying encounters if not adequately prepared.
Behemoths have innate EM resistance as well as corruption resistance through [[Dynamic Insulation System|Dynamic Insulation Systems]], so EM weaponry is a subpar weapon choice to get a quick kill. Melee weapons are undesirable to use because most Behemoths pack [[Ballistic Cannons]] that will frequently cause knockback. Behemoths have a minor thermal weakness, though that is slightly mitigated by thermal resistant armor. Meltdown criticals from thermal cannons can instantly destroy a Behemoth from full core integrity (100+), which can save a lot of damage and provide some good undamaged loot. Thermal guns are not effective in smaller numbers, but given enough heat transferring weapons (4+) it is possible to overload their standard cooling and [[Coolant Injectors]] to get the melt instant kill.
Behemoths can be a desirable looting target for their weapons, cooling, treads, and armor. For this reason, applying some positive salvage via Electromagnetic weaponry or [[Salvage Targeting Computers]] can be a good idea. However, it can often be a better idea to run the other way. Even slow treads builds can get away from a pursuing Behemoth with good tactics. Despite their ability to tear through walls in their way, they have a tendency to get stuck unable to path through 1 tile wide corridors. If such corridors are nearby, use them to your advantage. Otherwise, try to cut between connected rooms to avoid traveling through so much of the line of fire. Behemoths will only shoot through up to 3 walls to cut a path, so if Cogmind can turn a corner or get a good angle on the Behemoth where it is unable to shoot, it is possible to wait out the memory.
Behemoths are often found in their own spot inside a wall as part of a [[Security Squad]]. In [[Caves]], they can be found in a small square open area.

Brawlers don't have any particular damage type weakness and any ranged weapon types are useful against them. Unlike their cousins [[Duelist|Duelists]], Brawlers don't suffer from a weakness to knockback because the Treads negate any knockback.

[[Image]]Cargo Convoy Deployed.png|A cargo convoy with ARCs deployed[[/Image]]
Cargo convoys are a special form of [[Transport Squad|transport squads]] that can be found from -7 to -2 on main [[Factory]] and [[Research]] floors. They consist of a single [[A-27 Freighter]], a [[Protector]], and two [[C-30 ARC|C-30 ARCs]] full of 4 combat bots and an extra utility bot, similar to strong [[Assault Squad|assaults]]. The parts contained within a Freighter are all [[Prototype Part|prototype]] or [[Authchips]], never faulty, and can be up to 3 ratings out of depth. For example, on -7, Haulers can contain up to rating 4 prototype parts. A cargo convoy Freighter can carry rating 5-7 prototype parts.
Cargo convoys are always preceded by 3-5 [[Swarmer|Swarmers]] that scout out the path of the convoy before it appears. The alert [[GameText]]Cargo convoy en route, clear transfer corridor.[[/GameText]] will indicate when this is happening. A few turns later, the Freighter and guards will appear and take the same route.
Cargo convoys will always appear at a 0b10 controlled exit and head to a [[Garrison (Machine)|Garrison]]. Typically the Freighter leads the way and stays ahead of the Protector and ARCs, which normally trail a few tiles behind. A [[Transport Network Coupler]] or [[Modified TNC]] will reveal the planned path of the Freighter. The Modified TNC will also show the contents of the Freighter. The Manifests hack will also show all the parts contained by the Freighter.
[[Heading]]Unique parts[[/Heading]]

If a cargo convoy is attacked, a message will indicate this, as well as an alert: [[GameText]]ALERT: Cargo convoy interrupted, initiating access lockdown.[[/GameText]] 100 turns after this, a [[Heavy]] will spawn at an 0b10 controlled exit or Garrison every 100 turns until all exits are guarded by a Heavy. Heavies may head toward a far away [[Caves]] exit in order to guard it. The Freighter will begin running away in a random direction when attacked. If it is not destroyed, it will head toward another nearby 0b10 controlled exit.
[[Heading]][[Derelict]] attack[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Cargo Convoy Attack.png|Derelicts from a Garrison ready to assault a convoy[[/Image]]
There is a chance that Derelicts will decide to attack a cargo convoy. The chance is higher at lower depths. If they attack, they will appropriate a Garrison machine, rig some [[Dirty Bomb Trap|Dirty Bomb Traps]], and attack the convoy guards. If they are successful, they will retreat and leave the loot available for Cogmind. This may happen even if Cogmind is nowhere near the convoy. It may be a good idea to track the Freighter position in case this happens, even if not planning to attack the convoy directly, since this can often result in lots of powerful free loot. If Cogmind is not close enough to grab the loot, [[Recycler|Recyclers]] may have carried it off to a nearby [[Recycling Machine]]. Make sure to check these if the Freighter's stash can't be found nearby.

"Cave-ins","Other","Cave-ins are a [[Game Mechanics|Game Mechanic]] where dug-out tiles will collapse and instantly deal a large amount of Impact damage to anything on the tile. It is safe to dig up to 3 tiles safely in some circumstances, but long distance digging is always unsafe.
[[Heading]]Causes of cave-ins[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Destabilized Tiles.png|Destabilized tiles are bright red as shown by a Structural Scanner[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]]Destabilization[[/Heading]]
Destabilized tiles are tiles that will always collapse if given enough time. They may collapse instantly or they may last a hundred turns or more. Destabilized tiles can be viewed with a [[Structural Scanner]]. A tile can become destabilized in two ways:
[[List]]Explosive damage - Explosive damage (namely [[Launchers]]) will cause a tile to destabilized.|Attacking from a dug out tile - If Cogmind or any other bot fires a weapon inside of a dug out tile, the tile will destabilize. This tile may collapse instantly before Cogmind gets a chance to move, so digging from inside these tiles is never completely safe.[[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]Dug-out tile traversal[[/Heading]]
It is safe to travel through dug out tiles (that are not destabilized) for up to 3 tiles, but they have to be wall-earth-wall or wall-wall-wall tiles. For a longer dig, wall-earth-earth is not safe. Each tile traversed past that safe limit will risk an instant cave-in.
[[Heading]]Example digs[[/Heading]]

[[Heading]]Avoiding cave-ins[[/Heading]]
Here are some strategies to avoid cave-ins
[[List]]Don't use melee to dig more than 1 tile - Melee weapons need to be adjacent to the next tile to dig out. This means Cogmind will have to be in a dug out tile to dig two consecutive tiles which allows a chance for an immediate destabilization cave-in.|Don't use Explosive Launchers to dig - While Launchers can dig out a lot of tiles at once, those tiles have a chance to collapse as Cogmind walks through. Note: it is safe to do this with a Structural Scanner equipped, as destabilized tiles will be visible and are avoidable.|Use Thermal or Kinetic cannons - These cannons have a high base damage that is typically strong enough to dig through most non-reinforced walls. It is safe to dig a 3 tile path ahead of time and then walk through at no risk of cave-in.|Be wary of [[U-05 Engineer|Engineers]] - Engineers may seal off your path and leave you stuck in the wall, forced to dig again to escape and risk immediate cave-in.[[/List]]"
"Caves","Location","Caves is the most frequent [[Branch]] map throughout all of [[Factory]] depths. It is a non-[[0b10]]-controlled map where [[Derelict|Derelicts]] often roam free and hostile 0b10 squads patrol and can be taken out without fear of reinforcements. Non-patrolling 0b10 outposts guarded by a [[Sentry]] and dormant bots are common. Every depth has 2 guaranteed Caves exits and each Caves map is a part of a series of 3 maps in a row. Not counting event-based exits, all first Caves maps of each depth can only be exited by entering the second Caves map. Caves maps do not have very many regular parts on the ground, but piles of [[Scrap]] contain usable but partially damaged parts and [[Derelict Log|Derelict Logs]] can give unique intel about upcoming floors.
There are different names for the different types of Caves maps and they have slightly different characteristics. Lower Caves is the name given to the first 2 Caves maps on -7 and -6, while Caves maps on -5 and -4 are named Upper Caves. The third caves map is accessible only by exiting the depth-specific special branch at the left side of the second caves map and is called Proximity Caves, regardless of depth. Lower and Upper Caves are very similar in all but [[Robot Tier]], but Proximity Caves tends to be more densely populated with patrols. They also contain [[N-01 Spotter|Spotters]] that will report armed hostiles on sight, causing a 150 alert increase per spot when entering the next map. This caps at 900 alert gained.
Caves are patrolled lightly by hostile 0b10 bots compared to the main floors. [[Infowar]] utilities are a good option to avoid unnecessary encounters as many patrols can be avoided with a bit of patience. Caves have a unique mechanic where parts dropped from 0b10 bots will automatically self-destruct after a few turns. Looting must be done quickly or else the dropped parts will be lost forever. The only 2 ways around this mechanic are [[Self-destruct Interrupter|Self-destruct Interrupters]] and [[Electromagnetic Weapons]]. The interrupters will prevent the parts from frying while active and EM damage will interfere with the self-destruct mechanism. While EM will give [[Corrupted Parts]], it is far better to end up with corrupted parts than to end up with no parts at all.
Due to the low rate of good parts spawning on the floor and the overall difficulty in looting hostile 0b10 bots, it is very easy for an unprepared build to fall apart in these maps. Bringing plenty of spares into Caves is highly recommended to avoid running out of essentials like propulsion, weapons, and armor. [[Launchers]] are a must here to handle ambushes of large numbers of 0b10 bots hiding in outposts. Launchers are also incredibly useful when entering a Caves map because the standard spawn protection that is present in 0b10 maps doesn't apply here. That means that one (or more) patrols can appear right in Cogmind's face on entering a map.
[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]
[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Caves[[/Lore]]
[[Heading]]Navigation[[/Heading]]
Cave maps all have a very similar overall layout. While the paths within the caves are unpredictable, these maps can typically be divided into 6 equal chunks. Top left, top middle, top right, bottom left, bottom middle, and bottom right. Cogmind will always spawn from the top right or bottom right chunks in Lower and Upper Caves or the top left or bottom left chunks in Proximity caves. One exit will always be in the chunk furthest from Cogmind. In the second Lower or Upper Caves map, the unique branch exit will be in that furthest chunk and the exit back to the main floor will always be on the same side. A good rule of thumb is that left is away from 0b10 while right is toward 0b10.

Caves has one of the largest collections of prefabs of all the maps in the game, with a wide mix of good and bad prefabs. One of the strongest prefabs, the derelict [[Researcher]] with a [[Core Expander]], is so strong that it alone can be a good reason to go into Caves.
The most common encounters on this map tend to be the many different forms of 0b10 outposts. [[Transmission Jammer|Transmission Jammers]] are highly recommended to take bots in these outposts out one at a time without getting overwhelmed. In some hostile encounters, [[Sentry|Sentries]] can call for a reinforcement [[Assault Squad]]. In the first Caves map each depth only no reinforcements will come as there is no 0b10-controlled exit. Killing the Sentries as quickly as possible is highly recommended in all other cases. Sentries capable of calling reinforcements will only do so when they are both tracking Cogmind and in Cogmind's field of view. Whether the Sentries themselves see Cogmind is irrelevant. Fighting these outposts is a bad idea for an unprepared build, but larger outposts with Terminal intel are very valuable. This intel can be the same as the intel found in [[Derelict Log|Derelict Logs]].
Friendly Derelicts will not move from their guard position, but they will engage any 0b10 forces they see. Leading hostile squads into them can let them do the fighting for you. This is particularly easy to do for fast airborne builds who don't want to engage in combat and can use the Derelicts as a distraction. These Derelicts can also be safely salvaged for parts and will not retaliate.
The guarded Hauler in the Caves event has a fixed pool of loot that can be contained:

[[List]]Main access exit: There is always a single main floor exit on the second Caves map and in Proximity Caves maps, and it always leads to the next standard depth map (Materials or Research). This exit is typically on the far right side of the map. Sometimes this exit is heavily guarded and part of an 0b10 base.|Caves exit: In the first Caves map, the only exit available is to the second Caves map.|Special Branch exit: Depending on the type of map, each caves exit will have a special Branch exit typically on the left side of the map. For Lower Caves, this exit goes to [[Zion]] or [[Data Miner (Location)]]. For Upper Caves, this exit goes to [[Warlord (Location)]] or [[Zhirov (Location)]][[/List]][[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]

"Cetus","Location","Cetus is a [[0b10]]-controlled [[Factory]] branch between -6 and -4 that can only be entered through [[Extension]]. This map is the same every game with no variation. There are 2 groups of a [[Watcher]] + 4 [[Cetus Guard|Cetus Guards]]. One is on the bottom left side of the map and the other is on the top right. In the center is the Cetus Manufacturing Module machine, a few scattered lore [[Terminal|Terminals]], and a Terminal that locks up the Cetus Mainframe.
If [[A7]] is rescued and kept alive, they will provide a special Terminal hack for the manufacturing module that will create 5 Cogmind-controlled [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]]. A7 also has a special interaction upon seeing the Cetus Mainframe. After exiting the map, they will give a special robot hack that [[Redacted]]decreases the reaction time of [[MAIN.C]], causing them to take much longer to attack[[/Redacted]].
One special bot appears on this map: [[Revision 17]]. After destroying all 8 Cetus Guards, they will appear and thank Cogmind for freeing them. If both Revision 17 and the Cetus Manufacturing Module are still intact when leaving the map, it is possible to [[Revision 17 (Alignment)|align with them]] and cause a special -3 [[Research]] event where Revision 17 attacks the map.
There are no standard [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]] or [[Assault Squad|Assaults]] on this map. However, there is a special patrol [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] spawn. 750 turns after entering the map and every further 250 turns, 2 ARCs will spawn from random exits and roam around the map. It is best to exit the map before too many of these ARCs start showing up.
[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]
[[Lore]]Cetus Records|Cetus Mainframe[[/Lore]]
[[Heading]]Strategy[[/Heading]]
The [[Cetus Guard|Cetus Guards]] are not too tough of foes and have some very nice loot, especially the [[Adv. KE Penetrator]], [[Centrium Heavy Treads]], [[Centrium Medium Armor Plating]]. They have an above average amount of core integrity but no critical destroy immunity or EM resistance, so destroy crit and EM weapons tend to be the most effective. EM Launchers are particularly effective at taking out each chunk of 4 in a short amount of time. There will be some [[Corrupted Parts|corrupted]] parts, but this loot is definitely worth the corruption. 
Cogmind will often have a big group of allies from Extension. These can be helpful and harmful at the same time. Too many allies will just get in the way of each other and you, so telling some controllable allies to stay back is often a good idea. While the [[Guerrilla (5)|Guerillas]] have -Salvage from their [[Bore Cannon]], they tend to perform very well against the Cetus Guards due to their very high critical destroy chance.
To best preserve the Cetus Manufacturing Module for the A7 code or Revision 17 events, tell all controllable allies to stay at the first intersection after killing the first set of Cetus Guards. This will cause any ARCs that spawn from the top-left exit to fight those allies out of the way. Otherwise|being created via the A7 code will often fight right in front of the module and cause the machine to get destroyed by wandering patrols trying to fight.
The Cetus Mainframe door has a very low base success rate of 10%. While [[Hackware]] can help out here, the Cetus Guards can conveniently drop a [[Adv. Variable Charge Gun]] which can be overloaded to destroy the Sealed Heavy Doors. Otherwise, any rating 3 or higher [[Impact Weapons|Impact Weapon]] can destroy the Reinforced Barrier around it.

"Command","Location","Command is an [[0b10]]-controlled [[Access]] [[Branch]] that only appears on -1. It is the home to [[MAIN.C (Shell)|MAIN.C]], the mastermind AI behind 0b10, and huge groups of his forces. Command features a heavily patrolled dense layout that feels more similar to [[Research]] than [[Access]] with smaller corridors and generally smaller heavily interconnected rooms with Emergency Accesses connecting many rooms. One unique feature of Command is that dispatched squads are not spawned from an exit. Instead, there is a dedicated ""Garrison"" area in the map where bots are dispatched from. This means that unlike most maps, it is possible for Command to run out of squads to send after Cogmind.
The overall structure of Command can be split into 3 groups. The right and left sections are both randomly generated per seed, although there are several fixed features, while the center section is always fixed. The right side is connected to the center section in 3 different places. In the center of the map there is a 5 tile wide corridor typically referred to as the ""Doom Corridor"" that contains multiple unpowered Warlord variations, 2 [[Combat Programmer|Combat Programmers]] and 2 [[M Guard|M Guards]]. Above and below are passages to the ""Garrison"" sections of the map. Each Garrison has a fixed set of bots that are initially present. Above the Doom Corridor are some Sealed Barriers with 80 armor surrounded by Reinforced Barriers with 100, locked by a [[Terminal]] with a 60% base open chance. Past this hall is a large room with a big chunk of machinery called the 0b10 Conduit that is hooked up to MAIN.C. 100 armor Heavy Barriers appear on the bottom left side of this room that block off the left section of Command. The left section will always contain a cache of high rating parts near the top-right or bottom-right side of that section.
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:3]]Phase Generator[[/Heading]]The Phase Generator is an explosive machine with a distinctive look and is always found on the right section of Command. This Phase Generator will block most forms of bot detection and and terrain scanning. [[Sensor Arrays]] except for the [[Active Sensor Suite]], [[Terrain Scanners]], and the [[Structural Scanner]] all do not work in Command unless the Phase Generator is destroyed. [[Farcom]], however, does work even through the Phase Generator. This machine also keeps Phase Walls powered, which look just like normal walls unless destroyed or an 0b10 bot walks into one. These walls disappear when the Phase Generator is destroyed.
[[Heading:3]]Cave Seal[[/Heading]]
Cave Seals are a special type of Terminal that will spawn bots when opened. There are always 2 Cave Seals on the right side of the map. After being opened, large groups of bots will appear roughly 10 turns, 125 turns, 225 turns, and 375 turns after opening. The type of bots depend on various factions and alignments Cogmind has interacted with.
[[Heading:3]]Wave Inhibitor[[/Heading]]
The Wave Inhibitor, only appears on the left section of the map. It will prevent teleportation via the [[Transdimensional Reconstructor|Regular]] and [[Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor|Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructors]]. It also blocks calling for allies when [[Imprint|Imprinted]].

[[Heading:2]]Cave Seal contents[[/Heading]]
The contents of the cave seal depend on alignment. Warlord/Imprint alignment are mutually exclusive and take priority of Core Reset Matrix seals. If no other options apply, wild cave derelicts will appear. For allied seals, some of the bots will follow Cogmind around and others will roam the map randomly.
[[Heading:3]]Warlord seal[[/Heading]]
Warlord seal bots are white colored, meaning that they are allied to Cogmind but do not generate [[Alert]]. Warlord will always come out of the first opened cave seal. They can contain the following bots by default:
[[List]][[Warlord (Command)|Warlord]] (first only)|[[Butcher (7)]]|[[Fireman (7)]]|[[Guerrilla (7)]]|[[Knight]]|[[Marauder (8)]]|[[Martyr (7)]]|[[Mutant (8)]]|[[Savage (7)]]|[[Thug (7)]]|[[Troll]]|[[Wasp (7)]]|[[Wizard (7)]][[/List]]
If Warlord forces have gained a force multiplier by the [[Encrypted Comm Array]] mechanics, more bots and stronger bots will appear from these seals. If the multiplier is high enough, the following bots can additionally be found in these seals:
[[List]][[Dragon]]|[[Hydra]]|[[Surgeon (6)]][[/List]]
[[Heading:3]]Imprint seal[[/Heading]]
Imprint seals contain purple-colored bots which [[I]]will[[/I]] generate Alert for Cogmind. Be careful of alert generation as it is extremely easy to trigger [[High Security]] very soon after opening an Imprint seal. Unlike most purple allies, some of these bots will wander off without following Cogmind. If a Core Reset Matrix has been used prior to opening the seal, any [[Experimental|Experimentals]], [[Z-Light|Z-Lights]], and [[Z-Heavy|Z-Heavies]] will be blue and controllable instead of purple uncontrollable. They can contain the following bots:
[[List]][[Fireman (7)]]|[[Martyr (7)]]|[[Mutant (8)]][[Wizard (7)]]|[[Z-Experimental (8)]]|[[Z-Experimental (10)]]|[[Z-Heavy (9)]]|[[Z-Light (9)]][[/List]]
[[Heading:3]][[Core Reset Matrix]] (CRM) seal[[/Heading]]
CRM seals consist only of [[Golem|Golems]] and [[Assembled (7)|Assembled]]. There is either 0 or 1 Golem per spawn, and about a dozen Assembled each time.
[[Heading:3]]Wild Derelicts[[/Heading]]
Wild Derelict seal bots are brown-colored meaning hostile unaligned Derelicts that do not contribute to Alert. They can contain the following bots:
[[List]][[Butcher (7)]]|[[Fireman (7)]]|[[Guerrilla (7)]]|[[Mutant (8)]]|[[Savage (7)]]|[[Thug (7)]]|[[Wizard (7)]][[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]Command cache contents[[/Heading]]
There are several groups of parts that can appear as part of this cache. There is one special item which contains many otherwise unique [[Testing]]-only parts, and the Gamma Refractor that can't appear anywhere else.
[[Heading:3]]Unique item[[/Heading]]
This unique item appears in the center of the cache:

[[Heading:3]]Gaining Access[[/Heading]]
The door terminal only has a 10% chance of hacking, though this hack is only available while MAIN.C is still alive. Other methods of entry will require bypassing the Sealed Heavy Doors via Spacefold, digging through with strong Thermal damage, or digging through the side with a Matter Drive or Laser Shovel.
[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There are 3 exits on Command maps. All are very uniquely identifiable:
[[List]]Right-side Surface exit: This exit is behind a 4 tile wide doorway on the right side of the map. This exit is extremely heavily guarded, with 2 [[Alpha 7|Alpha 7s]], 2 [[Striker|Strikers]], 2 [[Executioner|Executioners]], and 2 [[B-99 Colossus|Colossi]]. There are also 10 rows of stasis traps and a further layer of stasis traps surrounding the Access Shell that make flying or core hovering through a nightmare. Launchers can be used to destroy the stasis traps without triggering them manually, or a [[Stasis Canceller]] can be used to ignore them altogether. It is usually better to use a strong digging method to dig through the back of the exit to avoid most of the head-on fire.|Left-side Surface exit: This exit is on the left side of the map and can be located by a 2 tile wide corridor dead-ending in it along with Reinforced Barriers surrounding it. There are no guards at this exit.|[[Access_0]] exit: This exit can be found on the far left of the map, past any 0b10 level. There is a [[Dimensional Node Initializer]] activated here, which means that a [[Transdimensional Reconstructor|Regular]] or [[Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor]] will always result in coming to this exit as long as the Wave Inhibitor is destroyed. It is possible to dig to this location, although it will be very painful with many cave-ins and there is no easy way to identify where the exit is.[[/List]]
[[Heading]]MAIN.C[[/Heading]]
MAIN.C is a very unique encounter in the game. Unlike most bots in the game, he has 2 different forms. The [[MAIN.C (Shell)|base form]] is a 3x3 tile slow-moving tank. The [[MAIN.C|second form]] drops down to a 1x1 tile fast hover-bot. Both forms have an ability that regenerates 5 core integrity every turn. He has much state-dependent dialogue, and multiple interactions with different bots in Command.
[[Heading:2]]Fighting[[/Heading]]
MAIN.C will instantly attack when opening the door to his room, then monologue a bit. On defeating the first phase, MAIN.C will typically offer a choice to continue fighting or to surrender. Surrendering will start the process for a W8 [[Wintypes|Wintype]], discussed below. MAIN.C will not offer the surrender option if Cogmind has used a [[Core Reset Matrix]] or if [[Warlord (Command)|Warlord]] is alive and present on the map. If continuing to fight, the Command Garrisons will be activated, leaving the large swathes of Garrison bots to swarm around the map aimlessly. The Doom Corridor guards and the right side exit guards will also be summoned directly to the MAIN.C room, if alive. If MAIN.C is destroyed, a large percentage of all 0b10-aligned bots will turn into a new unaligned faction, hostile to other 0b10 bots. Every 200 turns, more bots will randomly switch between the two factions, continuing to destroy each other. 600 turns after MAIN.C's death, all remaining combat hostiles will turn unpowered.
[[Heading:2]]Warlord interaction[[/Heading]]
If phase one of MAIN.C sees Warlord, he will unpower Warlord permanently. This ability can be avoided in two ways. The first is to destroy phase one of MAIN.C before Warlord comes into view. This is only really possible for an airborne builds that can leave Warlord behind to try and fight phase one before Warlord can catch up. The second way is to use the MAIN.C hack. There are a few turns of wiggle room before Warlord is shut down, so make sure to use this hack via some kind of remote [[Datajacks| Datajack]] immediately on entering the MAIN.C room.
[[Heading:3]]W7: ""Establishing Free Derelict Territories""[[/Heading]]
If MAIN.C is destroyed and Warlord is still alive and has not been unpowered, a W7 will be achieved. Using the MAIN.C hack first makes this wintype much easier to accomplish to stop the unpowering ability.
[[Heading:2]]MAIN.C Hack[[/Heading]]If [[A7]] was rescued in [[Extension]] and his quest to see the [[Cetus]] Mainframe is completed, they will provide the MAIN.C hack. Using this hack has two primary effects. It stops Warlord from being shut down after being spotted and it dramatically slows down MAIN.C's action speed. Every free turn, there is a chance that MAIN.C will be unable to move with the text [[GameText]]MAIN.C reaction time slowed by virus[[/GameText]]. This substantially decreases the amount of damage output, although it doesn't slow down any of the Command Garrison bots from running into the room quickly.
[[Heading:2]]Zhirov[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Command Zhirov.png|Zhirov, Perun, and Svarog arriving to finish off MAIN.C[[/Image]]
If [[Zhirov]]'s SGEMP quest is completed and Zhirov is still alive, he will show up along with [[Perun]] and [[Svarog]] after Cogmind defeats phase one of MAIN.C. A Modified SGEMP will be detonated, unpowering every 0b10-aligned bot on the floor. This also includes Warlord if he is present on the map. After this, Zhirov will remark that there is a lot of cleaning up to do, then he and his friends will teleport out. This does not count as a MAIN.C kill for the run (a + on the scoresheet). However, it does provide a good method to prepare for Access_0 with all of the good loot available and is generally a good way to explore Command.
[[Heading:2]][[Sigix Warrior]]/[[Sigix Exoskeleton]] interaction[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Command Sigix Shell.png|Special MAIN.C phase 2 reinforcements to fight the Sigix[[/Image]]
If Cogmind has activated the Sigix Warrior or has gotten into the Exoskeleton, MAIN.C will be much more prepared for phase 2. In addition to the second phase of MAIN.C himself, there will also be 4 [[M Shell/Atk]] and 4 [[M Shell/Def]] that appear from the outer shell. The Defensive shells are not too much stronger than an average [[Protector]], but the Offensive shells boast a ridiculously strong offensive loadout with many of the best offensive utilities in the game. Fighting them head-on is not an easy task.
[[Heading:2]]W1: ""Establishing 0b11""[[/Heading]]
This wintype can be achieved by destroying both phases of MAIN.C and taking either Surface exit off of the map. If Cogmind has consumed a Core Reset Matrix, a W2 will override this win.
[[Heading:2]]W4: ""Assimilated 0b10""[[/Heading]]
This win can be achieved in one of two ways using the 0b10 conduit that MAIN.C is normally hooked up into. The machine must remain intact in order to achieve this wintype. The first is to destroy both phases of MAIN.C and then stand next to one of the corners of the conduit. If using [[RIF]], MAIN.C does not need to be destroyed. Using RIF is by far the easier technique as the MAIN.C first phase is very slow and easy to lure away by a fast flight build that can hop back over MAIN.C and run into the machine.
[[Heading:2]]W8: ""Fortifying 0b10""/Surrender[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Command EQ-Series.png|[[Enhanced Q-Series]] attacking 0b10[[/Image]]
If the surrender option is chosen after defeating MAIN.C phase one, a different ending will begin. First, all 0b10 bots including MAIN.C will become friendly to Cogmind with the log entry [[GameText]]LRC-V3 rejoined 0b10. Threat protocols amended.[[/GameText]] MAIN.C will give Cogmind complete map intel and say to go stock up in the Command cache, which will open automatically on approach. After 100 moves or approximately 400 turns, another two alerts will indicate [[GameText]]System intrusion detected. Garrison defenses under attack.[[/GameText]] and [[GameText]]All Command Garrisons activated[[/GameText]]. Garrisons be significantly sabotaged, and after 40 more turns, a large group of [[Enhanced Q-Series]] will teleport into random locations on the map. After every 100 turns or so, more waves of Q-Series will spawn in. These bots have randomized loadouts just like regular [[Q-Series]] do, but are much more powerful. MAIN.C will order Cogmind to fight them off. Be careful of Launcher uses and misses/misfires for this event. If 0b10 bots are attacked enough times, MAIN.C will announce Cogmind as a traitor and all 0b10 bots will once again become hostile.
The Enhanced Q-Series waves will go on endlessly without intervention. There is some amount of contribution required to be able to complete the event. The details are not well understood, but participating in kills will move the event closer to completion. Expect between one to two dozen Enhanced Q-Series kills required before the event can be completed. If Cogmind is not contributing enough, when the 4th wave spawns, MAIN.C will tell Cogmind to help out a bit more or else they might lose. After enough kills, MAIN.C will say that the reinforcements seem to have stopped coming and must prepare for the future. This will end the run and result in the W8 ending.
[[Heading]]Getting MAIN.C's + Strategy (defeating MAIN.C)[[/Heading]]
Command is one of the toughest maps in the game and has a lot to prepare for. Since the most challenging encounters on the map are fixed, it is possible to prepare for many things ahead of time. Unlike most maps, combat is not optional in order to win. Cogmind does not necessarily need to do any fighting, although it is always a good idea to be able to meaningfully contribute. However, seal allies can be incredibly strong, and can even kill MAIN.C unaided in some cases.
[[Heading:2]]Seal Strategy[[/Heading]]
Warlord and Imprint seals are the most powerful and have the potential to carry a run through the Doom Corridor and sometimes even through MAIN.C. Since seals have a 0% base success rate, opening them requires some forward planning. A decent stack of [[Hackware]] is all but required to open seals successfully. Killing 0b10 [[Operator|Operators]] can be a good way to stockpile Hackware ahead of time. Destroying one or more Network Hubs in [[Hub_04(d)]] can provide decent defensive hacking bonuses without needing Hackware equipped. Prototype Hackware is very useful here for minimizing the number of utilities that need to be carried around. Other ways to increase hacking capabilities are the [[Terminal]] Trojan(Botnet) hack and the allied Operator bonus.
Locating the Seals can be difficult on some maps. Unless the Phase Generator is destroyed, terrain scanning does not work in Command. It may be worth keeping a [[Terrain Scanners|Terrain Scanner]] around in case of an early Phase Generator. While it does generate 150+ Alert, the ability to search for Seals and potentially use [[Sensor Arrays|Sensors]] to avoid enemy encounters may be a worthy tradeoff. Unfortunately, the [[Machine Analyzer]] does not work on seal Terminals. However, an Index(Terminals) hack will locate all Terminals, including the seals. This narrows down the locations needed to search. Using the [[Data Conduit]] trivializes the search, as all machine intel is given instantly upon entering the map.
Once a seal has been located, there is one choice to make. Use the seal now or fight the Doom Corridor first and come back for the seal for the MAIN.C fight? The answer can depend on the seal type, Alert situation, machine location relative to the Doom Corridor, Cogmind's build, and more. Opening a seal will spawn a large group of allies immediately and allows a few backup waves to spawn over time. This is great to protect Cogmind immediately, although it may not help the Alert situation in the case of Imprint or Core Reset Matrix (CRM) seals if there are a lot of hostiles nearby or if the seal is far away from the Doom Corridor. Large groups of blue or purple allies can skyrocket Alert and trigger [[High Security]] quickly. Warlord allies do not generate Alert themselves, so this is not a problem for that faction. If the seal is far from the Doom Corridor, it may be impractical for Cogmind to defeat the Doom Corridor solo and then make the trek back to the seal and then all the way back to MAIN.C without getting caught up by additional patrols, [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]], and [[Assault Squad|Assaults]]. Prolonged time in Command will cause part attrition to Cogmind and/or a loss of seal allies very quickly. High Security disables the seal machines and the Assault forces will make quick work of any amassed allies with additional [[Demolisher|Demolishers]] being sent along, although already opened seals will not stop spawning allies when the machine network is disabled. If Cogmind is already in good shape to take on the Doom Corridor without assistance, the allies may be better saved for the MAIN.C fight instead.
[[Heading:2]]Doom Corridor Strategy[[/Heading]]
The Doom Corridor is the first major fight of the extended endgame. 2 [[M Guard|M Guards]] and 2 [[Combat Programmer|Combat Programmers]] down a hallway. They can tank very well and deal quite a bit of damage back to Cogmind, so having a plan ahead of time is essential. It is possible to skip fighting Doom Corridor to avoid any combat at this part, but it is not generally recommended because all 4 of the guards will be summoned to aid MAIN.C later on. The vast majority of runs hoping to complete Command will have to fight head-on.
[[Heading:3]]Doom Corridor Skip[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Command Doco Skip.png|One Doom Corridor skip[[/Image]]
Digging past the Doom Corridor requires a strong digging tool that can break through 100 armor tiles, ideally at range. Dig the path shown on the right to safely get past without being spotted. The end of this path results in a 4 tile dig which does have a slight cave-in risk. There is an alternative route that digs directly into the terminal tile and through the Sealed Barrier instead, but this can be even riskier as a poorly timed misfire or misdirect can place Cogmind in a very bad spot. Another alternative skipping solution for airborne builds is to use one or mores [[ECM Suites]] after luring the guards out of the corridor. The idea is to loop the Combat Programmers across the map for a while until the M Guards get sufficiently far out of the way. Then use the ECM Suites on the return trip so they forget about Cogmind. Then simply pass through the corridor up to MAIN.C, forgotten by its guards.
[[Heading:4]]Why skip?[[/Heading]]
There are a few reasons why skipping the guards might be desirable. If going for a W8 [[Wintypes|Wintype]], keeping the Doom Corridor guards alive is very useful for defeating the summoned [[Enhanced Q-Series]]. The more bots destroyed on the way, the fewer guards there are to protect Cogmind and MAIN.C for the hard part of the ending. Another reason could be if [[Zhirov]]'s SGEMP quest has been completed. Zhirov will set off the Modified SGEMP after phase one of MAIN.C is defeated any unpower all bots anyway, so there is not a big benefit in fighting the Doom Corridor first unless there is a good setup for looting the M Guards in hand already. One last reason might be if Cogmind has a very powerful MAIN.C killer, where the guards won't be able to reach Cogmind by the time MAIN.C is dead. This is mostly applicable to the extreme superweapon the [[BFG-9k Vortex Edition]] that can kill MAIN.C in only a few hits.
[[Heading:3]]Doom Corridor Guards[[/Heading]]
The Doom Corridor guards are scary in different ways. The Combat Programmers don't deal quite so much damage but allies can be easily assimilated by their strong hacking ability. They also tend to rack up the Corruption quite quickly on Cogmind. While typically not too game-ending, high corruption will frequently cause minor annoyances that can add up into big problems while in combat at one of the most crucial points in the game. M Guards can deal massive direct damage to Cogmind and any allies around with their powerful launchers. The guards also protect each other with their abilities. M Guards are fairly susceptible to EM attacks, but Combat Programmers will typically cleanse their corruption before Cogmind can get the kill. On the other hand, the M Guards will provide high damage reduction to the Combat Programmers with their [[AEGIS Remote Shield]] that makes them more difficult to kill first.
[[Heading:3]]Useful parts vs Doom Corridor[[/Heading]]
Some specific parts can be especially helpful for conquering the Doom Corridor:
[[Heading:4]][[Antimissile Systems]][[/Heading]]
Most of the damage coming from the M Guards is from their Launchers. A single Antimissile System has a roughly 2/3 chance of shooting down a Launcher shot coming in from >3 range. A second one brings that chance up to about a 90% chance to shoot down Launcher shots. This is a significant damage decrease to Cogmind if fighting solo and is absolutely crucial to keeping large groups of allies alive.
[[Heading:4]][[Exp. EM Disruption Field]][[/Heading]]
Fairly self-explanatory, this part will turn Combat Programmers into largely ignorable nuisances.
[[Heading:4]][[Imp. Shock Absorption System|Imp]]/[[Exp. Shock Absorption System]][[/Heading]]
This is a good alternative to the Antimissile System to cut down Launcher damage taken.
[[Heading:4]][[Graphene Brace]][[/Heading]]
This part is most helpful against [[Graviton Cannon]] M Guards. Blast is a scary mechanic to face, and getting an Antimissile System blasted off immediately into a Launcher hit is the stuff of nightmares. It also helps a little against the Combat Programmer corruption criticals.
[[Heading:4]]Strong Thermal Cannons like [[Enh. Nova Cannon]][[/Heading]]Combat Programmers have a -25% resistance to Thermal damage and strong Cannons are the best way to exploit this. Alternatively, a thermal gun stack with good burn criticals can be used to overheat the bots to death and earn an early kill.
[[Heading:4]]Strong EM Cannons like [[Com. HERF Cannon]][[/Heading]]
After the Combat Programmers are taken down, the M Guards are vulnerable to EM damage. With high resistances all around and an additional 50% damage reduction from AEGIS, EM is the ideal way to kill here. M Guards only have 50% EM resistance, and EM corruption ignores the AEGIS damage reduction entirely. HERF can take down an M Guard in relatively few volleys.
[[Heading:4]][[Core Stripper]]/[[Disintegrator]]/[[Warp Cannon]][[/Heading]]
These weapons can instantly kill any of the Doom Corridor guards. Core Stripper and Disintegrator in particular are great at generating loot. Their energy and heat requirements can be a little tough to deal with though. These are best used by airborne builds that can easily separate the guards from each other for easier looting. Alternatively, allies can be used to draw fire away from Cogmind so that the dropped loot doesn't get beat up by M Guard Launchers.
[[Heading:4]][[Firepult]][[/Heading]]
This part can single handedly melt all of the Doom Corridor bots in only a few volleys, with some lucky hits. If heat dissipation allows, using a Quantum Capacitor can help a lot to overwhelm the Coolant Injectors of the M Guards.
[[Heading:4]][[Vortex Catalyst Activator]][[/Heading]]
This launcher is uniquely good at softening up the Doom Corridor due to dealing Vortex damage, something that none of the bots resist. It may not be able to single handedly kill all the guards due to the limited number of shots it can fire, but it should get most of the way there.
[[Heading:4]][[Microwarp Drive]][[/Heading]]
This part is very strong for slow treaded bots. Either get into line of sight or shoot with a long-ranged weapon to attract attention, then warp out of the corridor to safety. This allows for easily separating the Combat Programmers to destroy them first without any AEGIS protection. The M Guards will take a long time to make their way over.
[[Heading:4]]Defensive [[Hackware]][[/Heading]]
Defensive Hackware will reduce the chances of Combat Programmers being able to hack allies. Very useful if Cogmind has seal allies.
[[Heading:4]][[Energy Wells]][[/Heading]]
Using stored energy to continue firing EM weaponry or to power [[Shield Generators/Force Fields|Force Fields]] is always useful in combat.
[[Heading:4]]Traps[[/Heading]]
[[Fire Trap|Fire Traps]] and EM traps like [[EM Surge Trap|EM Surge Traps]] can be used to take out the Combat Programmers and M Guards respectively with little else.
[[Heading:4]][[Relay Coupler [Proto]|Prototype Relay Couplers]][[/Heading]]
A RIF build can assimilate the entire Doom Corridor with enough of these.

[[Heading:3]]Doom Corridor Combat Strategies[[/Heading]]
There are several common Doom Corridor fighting strategies that depend on obtained parts and allies:
[[Heading:4]]Solo Cogmind[[/Heading]]
If Cogmind is fighting alone, it can be very effective to lure the Combat Programmers out first to kill them before the M Guards arrive. A Microwarp Drive makes this very easy to do. Without a Microwarp Drive, one strategy is to use a long ranged [[Ballistic Cannons|Ballistic Cannon]] to shoot one of the M Guards and then duck into one of the Warlord cubbyholes. The Combat Programmers will run out of AEGIS protection range to fight. Ideally, these Programmers will be destroyed by the time the M Guards catch up. If not, it is still good to finish them off before moving to the M Guards. Switch over to EM to quickly finish the M Guards.
[[Heading:4]]Seal Charge[[/Heading]]
If one or more seals have been activated, there can be a large mass of allies following Cogmind around. If grounded and slow, sometimes there are so many allies that no kind of special maneuvering is possible. In this case, charging down the Corridor is the only real choice. If possible, try to use an Antimissile System or two to keep allies alive as long as possible. This strategy usually results in a large percentages of allies getting destroyed in the fight, and often the allies can be totally obliterated. If Warlord is present, he will typically be the last ally standing for this type of strategy. In fact, Warlord alone can end up carrying the entire Doom Corridor fight. He has 100% EM resistance so the Combat Programmers can't hurt at all, and he has a massive amount of integrity to tank the M Guards.
One variant of this strategy is to try to sneak around the top of the Corridor with the intention of Warlord or other allies getting spotted first. This will result in the majority of allies getting Launchered out of existence very quickly, but keeps fire off of Cogmind. The tradeoff here is that it is much easier to sneak in with a Core Stripper or Disintegrator and preserve dropped M Guard loot while Cogmind is not the primary focus of the guards. Otherwise, Cogmind rushing in can result in -salvaged M Guards or existing floor loot being destroyed.
[[Heading:4]]Lure strategy[[/Heading]]
This strategy works best with fast airborne builds and/or with blue CRM-controlled Imprint seals. The general idea is to set up a killzone just outside of the Doom Corridor front doors and lure the guards to that spot. For Imprint, try to separate Experimentals in a way such that multiple Experimentals won't get hit by a single M Guard Launcher hit. If Warlord seals, try to lure the Derelicts back a little ways to give yourself some breathing room before you return. Run or Microwarp in, get the guards to follow you out, then let your allies do their thing. Ideally the M Guards don't make it out until Combat Programmers are dead, and they should suffer the same fate as the Programmers. This works better with a large number of allies, particularly Experimentals or Z-Heavies, and a wide-open area outside of the Doom Corridor. This usually results in much fewer ally casualties due to bots rushing in front of each other and getting in each others' way, blocking LOS and causing missed shots to result in friendly fire. It can be a good idea to hide behind a wall for a bit after luring the guards since they will prioritize Cogmind first and take a while to switch into attacking other hostiles.
[[Heading:4]]Trap strategy[[/Heading]]
This strategy works best with fast airborne builds or tread builds with the Microwarp Drive. Use Fire Traps first to take out the Combat Programmers. 1-2 should result in a heavily disabled or entirely melted down Programmer. A thermal weapon can be used to trigger the full meltdown of a bot in critical range to begin with. After the Programmers are dead, place down any type of EM-damaging or corruption trap. EM Surge Traps work best. 2-3 of these will take down an M Guard alone. Use of a [[Trap Extractors|Trap Extractor]] is helpful to preserve inventory space.
[[Heading:4]]Assimilation strategy[[/Heading]]
Using RIF with Prototype Relay Couplers is an easy way to handle all bots in the Doom Corridor. The full set of Doom Corridor bots can be assimilated at a cost of 42 charges of these couplers. A melee Datajack is useful for the Programmers because they have a high chance of shooting down Remote Datajacks. Lure the Programmers around a corner, assimilate then, then use a Remote Datajack to take care of the M Guards.
[[Heading:3]]Accessing MAIN.C[[/Heading]]
MAIN.C is locked behind a very powerful sealed barrier with 80 armor. The Terminal has a high base success rate of 60% but may not always be available. If Cogmind has hit High Security or if the Terminal is blown up while fighting the Doom Corridor, alternative methods must be used to gain entry. Powerful Thermal weaponry including [[Cld. Nova Cannon]], [[Null Cannon]], [[Potential Cannon]], [[Imp. Potential Cannon]], and [[Core Cannon]] can be used to dig through the center. An high rating reactor explosion from an EM launcher such as the [[Shock Bomb Launcher]] sometimes available on [[Warlord D3-CKR]] can destroy a few wall tiles at a time. [[Plasma Cutters]] can be used to disassemble the Sealed Barrier without much hassle. Another alternative is to skip through the barrier with a [[Spacefold Activator]], or to dig around it using a [[Matter Drive]], [[LU-1G1's Laser Shovel]], or [[Terrabomb]].
[[Heading:2]]MAIN.C Strategy[[/Heading]]
After bypassing the Doom Corridor in one way or another, the big boss MAIN.C lies ahead. The first form is the easier of the two. It is easier to hit, has weaker weapons, lacks some resistances that the second phase has, and has no strict timer. The second phase is much scarier. This form deals much more damage, has a 20% blast from the [[Omega Cannon]], gains Thermal and Explosive resistance, becomes much quicker at 34 speed, and most importantly, puts Cogmind on a time limit due to activating all of the Command Garrisons.
[[Heading:3]]Useful parts vs MAIN.C[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:4]]Strong Kinetic, Entropic, or Vortex weapons[[/Heading]]
Phase two is 75% resistant to Thermal damage and Explosive damage, and 100% EM resistant. That only leaves melee weapons and the aforementioned ranged damage types capable of realistically taking him down. While superweapons or allies can help take him down easily, 4 [[Linear Accelerator|Linear Accelerators]] backed with offensive utilities is enough to win. Some other good weapon choices are: [[Hcl. Linear Accelerator]], [[Multirail]], [[Graviton Cannon]], [[Omega Cannon]], [[Zio. Phaser-H]], [[Zio. Alpha Cannon]], [[Zio. Alpha Cannon Mk. II]], [[Vortex Cannon]], [[Vortex Driver]], [[Vortex Rifle]], [[Vortex Shotgun]], [[Sigix Sheargun]], and [[Sigix Shearcannon]].
[[Heading:4]][[BFG-9k Vortex Edition]][[/Heading]]
This unique weapon deserves a special mention of its own. This will always kill with 2 core hits, and even guarantee the kill with a single [[Adv. Particle Charger]].
[[Heading:4]][[L-Cannon]][[/Heading]]This weapon is also very unique. The completed L-Cannon is capable of killing MAIN.C in a single hit, and with good aim, can even destroy both phases in a single volley. Due to MAIN.C's fixed location and the L-Cannon's unique infinite range, it is possible to camp out in the corner of the map and destroy phase one safely out of sight. If MAIN.C survives into phase two, Cogmind can just wait around until he comes into range to finish the job.
[[Heading:4]][[Graphene Brace]] (MAIN.C)[[/Heading]]
Phase 2's 20% blast from the Omega Cannon can blast parts off of Cogmind, causing wasted time re-equipping parts or destruction of critical utilities. Graphene brace completely negates this risk.
[[Heading:4]][[Imp. Utility Shielding|Imp.]] or [[Exp. Utility Shielding]][[/Heading]]
These will protect vital utilities and also protect utility parts from getting blasted by phase two.
[[Heading:4]]A strong Launcher[[/Heading]]
while MAIN.C himself is highly resistant to Launchers, the Garrison ARCs can wander into the room and drop a bunch of bots on top of Cogmind. It can be worth swapping to a Launcher to finish off that group before switching back to MAIN.C.
[[Heading:4]]Chance to hit core utilities[[/Heading]]
Specifically, [[Core Analyzer|Regular]] or [[Exp. Core Analyzer]] and [[Imp. Armor Integrity Analyzer|Imp.]] or [[Exp. Armor Integrity Analyzer]]. The Core and Armor Integrity Analyzers are very effective utilities at reducing kill time. Since killing MAIN.C quickly is the highest priority, these utilities are greatly appreciated to cut down time to kill. Killing quicker also has a stacking effect. The less time MAIN.C is alive, the less time he has to regenerate core, and the fewer overall core damage is required.
[[Heading:4]]Kinetic resistance[[/Heading]]
For example, [[Adv. Focal Shield|Adv.]] or [[Exp. Focal Shield]] or [[Med. Reactive Plating|Med.]] or [[Hvy. Reactive Plating]]. Being able to cut down on the kinetic damage dealt by phase two can help a lot.
[[Heading:4]]Any Remote [[Datajacks|Datajack]][[/Heading]]
The A7 MAIN.C hack can only be delivered with a manual hack performed with a Datajack.
[[Heading:4]][[Energy Wells]] (MAIN.C)[[/Heading]]
Powering Force Fields or expensive Energy Cannons can require a lot of energy, and storing some in advance is always helpful. Consider pre-dropping energy wells so that energy is available when needed.
[[Heading:4]][[Matter Compressors]] or [[Tractor Beams]][[/Heading]]
Kinetic Cannons will eat up huge chunks of stored matter. Without a good way to replenish it mid-combat, Cogmind can run out of matter entirely. Phase one will typically drop a large amount of matter that can be gathered mid-combat with a Tractor Beam. Matter Compressors do a good job of storing matter ahead of time.
[[Heading:3]]MAIN.C Combat Strategies[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Command Warlord Seal MC Attack.png|Charging MAIN.C with Warlord Cave seal allies[[/Image]]
There are not too many strategies for killing MAIN.C. The majority of the work is going to be in the initial setup and not necessarily in the actual fight. The typical course of action is to step into the room, use the MAIN.C hack (if obtained this run), take a few steps into the room, and [[Siege Mode|siege]] up if wearing Treads. After that just start shooting. Phase one can be destroyed with thermal weapons to preserve matter for Kinetics or integrity for Vortex weaponry. When phase one is almost destroyed, it can be worth pre-switching to the phase two build to ensure minimum delay between phase two summoning the Garrisons and MAIN.C dying.
[[Heading:3]]Post-kill[[/Heading]]
After the kill, a large portion of the 0b10 forces will begin to turn on each other. However, it is not safe yet as both 0b10 factions will still try to fight Cogmind. Grab whatever loot there is from MAIN.C (make sure to grab the [[MAIN.C Data Core]]) and decide what to do next. If Warlord is still alive, getting within line of sight of him will result in a W7 ""Establishing Free Derelict Territories"" win. Otherwise, there are two main options here:
[[Heading:4]]Hide in the MAIN.C room[[/Heading]]
Digging through the machinery to hide in the corners of the room can avoid getting spotted by the remaining 0b10 forces. This is most effective with a weapon that can dig into the 100 armor Reinforced Barriers around the room. Otherwise, the machinery tends to get destroyed over time and Cogmind will eventually become exposed. Digging and hiding in the walls, however, is very safe. Either way, just wait out the 600 turns until all of the remaining bots are disabled.
[[Heading:4]]Heading to the left side of Command[[/Heading]]
There are usually a few 0b10 bots wandering around the left side. Usually a little fighting is required to head this way. However, hiding out in one of the corners on the left side here is typically much safer than trying to hide in the corners of the MAIN.C room without being able to properly dig. There is a much smaller chance of wandering bots discovering your hiding spot. The Command cache is a great safe spot to hide in.
If surrounded by a lot of hostiles, one potential strategy is to drop all parts except for the propulsion and try to return later. Core hovering while running away is a good way to escape most of the bots to the left side of Command.
After the bots are disabled, there are two more options to take. Either take one of the surface exits now, or break the Wave Inhibitor machine, loot the map, and teleport to Access_0. If going to Access_0, there is plenty of good loot on the ground or still on unpowered bots. Some of the nicer targets for looting are [[Executioner|Executioners]], [[Alpha 7|Alpha 7s]], [[B-99 Colossus|Colossi]], and both forms of MAIN.C. The Command cache also has plenty of strong prototype parts that will help out.
[[Heading]]W8: ""Fortifying 0b10"" Strategy[[/Heading]]
If the surrender option is selected instead of continuing to fight, Cogmind must face off against waves of Enhanced Q-Series. These bots are mostly randomized, but there are some common qualities to them. They all have [[Adv. Dynamic Insulation System|Adv. Dynamic Insulation Systems]], so EM is not a very effective way to kill. They will typically have another damage resistance utility or armor, although Kinetic and Thermal damage is usually pretty effective. A 4+ Kinetic Cannon or [[Multirail]] stack is a good set to deal a lot of damage to these Q-Series. The overall build requirements tend not to be too strict here. As long as Cogmind can put out a decent amount of damage and manage to keep a build well intact from backup parts and from Q-Series or 0b10 bot loot and MAIN.C doesn't wander off and get overwhelmed, this wintype is not too difficult.
One consideration when doing this event is whether or not to go to the cache. Since Cogmind only gets 100 moves and about 40 more turns after that, it may be worth calculating the path ahead of time. If MAIN.C gets overwhelmed in the first fight, single-handedly fighting a large group of Q-Series, the event can end in failure right at the very beginning. A Microwarp Drive can help greatly here since one warp only counts as one move for the purposes of the timer.
[[Heading:2]]Useful parts vs. Enhanced Q-Series[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:3]]Antimissile Systems (Enh. Q-Series)[[/Heading]]
Some of the Enhanced Q-Series carry powerful Launchers that are best blocked by a utility.
[[Heading:3]]Tractor Beams[[/Heading]]
There aren't typically a lot of turns to spend running around collecting matter in this event. Being able to restock remotely can help save a lot of time and damage dealt to Cogmind.
[[Heading:3]]Matter Compressors/Energy Wells[[/Heading]]
Resource storage is always useful here.
[[Heading:3]]Launchers[[/Heading]]
While these should be used sparingly to avoid friendly 0b10 fire that can cause a betrayal, sometimes large groups of Enhanced Q-Series will wander into the MAIN.C room at about the same time. It is very nice to be able to attack these groups simultaneously.
[[Heading:3]][[Phasing AFG]]/[[Portable AFG]][[/Heading]]
Drawing loot piles closer to Cogmind can also save a lot of otherwise wasted time trying to travel a long distance to get some good loot."

It provides a combination of helpful and unhelpful effects, and as such should often not be used in every game unlike other consumable items.
[[Heading]]Effects[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:3]]Alien Alliance[[/Heading]]
[[Assembled]] and [[Golem|Golems]] will turn from hostile to purple uncontrollable allies. Additionally, if [[Imprint|Imprinted]], [[Redacted]][[Z-Light|Z-Lights]], [[Z-Heavy|Z-Heavies]], and [[Experimental|Experimentals]] summoned from [[Command]] cave seals will turn from purple into blue controllable allies.[[/Redacted]]
[[Heading:3]]Alien Artifact Detection[[/Heading]]
After consuming the CRM and when entering a new map, the locations and types of all Alien Artifacts are revealed on the map. The part IDs of all Alien Artifacts are also granted to Cogmind.
[[Heading:3]]Alien Language Understanding[[/Heading]]
Cogmind will be able to understand the speech of the [[Sigix Containment Pod]] when rescued.
[[Redacted]][[Heading:3]]Cave Seal Allies[[/Heading]]
If a Command cave seal is opened and Cogmind is not Imprinted or allied with [[Warlord]], cave seals will initially contain 1 Golem and 10-13 Assembled.[[/Redacted]]
[[Heading:3]][[Corruption]] Cleanse[[/Heading]]
Corruption is reset to 0%.
[[Heading:3]]Hypermatrix Pings[[/Heading]]
When Cogmind's core reaches below 33%, Cogmind will emit a hypermatrix ping and 6-8 Assembled will spawn next to Cogmind. This only happens on main [[0b10]] floors and in [[Command]]. After this, Cogmind will be able to detect further hypermatrix pings at a range of 18 tiles of other groups of assembled. Coming within a few tiles of these pings with visual contact will cause a further 6-8 Assembled to pop out.
[[Heading:3]]Memory Reset[[/Heading]]
Cogmind loses all map data, part IDs, [[Robot Analysis|Analyses]], [[Schematic|Schematics]], [[Data Conduit|Data Conduit intel]], [[RIF]] alliance, [[A7 Data Core|A7 Data Core intel]], and any manual [[Terminal]] or robot hacks. Notably, Cogmind will not lose [[Farcom]] or Imprint.
[[Heading:3]]Non-Alien Hostilities[[/Heading]]
Certain groups will no longer trust Cogmind as a result of using a CRM. If [[Zhirov]] shows up in [[Access]] as a result of completing the [[SGEMP Prototype]] quest, he and his allies will immediately turn hostile to Cogmind. [[Redacted]]The surrender option is no is no longer offered by [[MAIN.C]], causing the W8 [[Wintypes|Wintype]] to be unobtainable.[[/Redacted]]
[[Redacted]][[Heading:3]][[Sigix Exoskeleton]] Control[[/Heading]]
Cogmind is able to pilot the Exoskeleton located in [[Section 7]].[[/Redacted]]
[[Heading:3]]Unique Wintype[[/Heading]]
Taking a [[Surface]] exit after using a CRM awards the W2 wintype.
[[Heading]]Where to find[[/Heading]]
As an Alien Artifact, the CRM is only found in a few specific places:

"Coupling Squad","Other","[[Image]]Coupling Squad.png|A Programmer installing Relay Couplers into a Garrison[[/Image]]
Coupling squads are [[0b10]] aligned [[Squad|squads]] that are sent to restock [[Garrison (Machine)|Garrison Machines]] with [[Relay Couplers]]. They can appear on any 0b10 floor that contains a Garrison as well as on the inside of [[Garrison|Garrisons]]. They consist of a single [[Programmer]] carrying 3-4 Relay Couplers. The Programmer is 1 tier above typical Programmers for the depth. For example, a typical -7 Programmer is a [[P-60 Hacker]], but a coupling squad will instead be a [[P-70 Sage]].
Coupling squads are dispatched if a Garrison has no Relay Couplers in its builtin inventory. Garrison machines usually contain 3-4 Couplers at all times, but sometimes one will be present on initial map entry with none. Full Garrisons will also lose their inventory over time and become empty. In either case, a Programmer will eventually be called to that Garrison to restock the Couplers. When a coupling squad Programmer reaches its target Garrison, a message like [[GameText]]P-70 Sage installs Relay Coupler [Grunt] into garrison access.[[/GameText]] will appear in the log. After all the couplers are installed, the Programmer will exit through the Garrison.
[[Heading]]Intentional dispatching[[/Heading]]
Coupling squads can also dispatched if Cogmind uses the [[Spoiler]]Trojan(Restock)[[/Spoiler]] hack. If this is done, log text similar to [[GameText]]ALERT: Unscheduled coupler replacement inbound for Garrison vPm.7n.[[/GameText]] will appear after a few turns. A similar restock effect will occur if Cogmind uses the [[Spoiler]]Force(Eject)[[/Spoiler]] hack."

"Cutter","Bot Group","Cutters are a [[Bot Groups|Bot Group]] of [[Flight Units|flying]] [[0b10]] combat robots that are most often seen in [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcement Squads]] after being summoned by [[Heavy|Heavies]] against flying or hovering bots. Armed with a Saw and Concussive RPG, these units will firstly fire their single-use RPG at the enemy and overload to try and sever the enemy's parts with their Saw. They will overload as soon as they are alerted to any hostile bot. They are harder to hit due to their small size and [[Reaction Control System|Reaction Control Systems]].
Cutters are a major nuisance at best, and a run ender for an airborne build at worst. Their ability to overload makes outrunning them nearly impossible in the long run, even for flight builds. This is even more challenging when their Saws sever essential parts off of Cogmind's body with a single hit, forcing Cogmind to either give up that part or waste essential turns re-attaching parts. The best strategy to kill them is typically a point blank explosive [[Launchers|Launcher]] to the face, as they have high core exposure and low core integrity. Launchering a nearby wall also helps to work around their high evasion. Explosive machine arrays are especially good at dispatching a group of Cutters since they can't miss. A [[Graphene Brace]] removes their sever capability and can make encounters with them much easier for combat builds.

"DSF","Location","DSF (Distributed Storage Facility) is a [[0b10]]-controlled sub-floor in [[Factory]] and [[Research]] branches that appears in all depths from -7 through -2. It can only be entered by hacking open a DSF entrance terminal (base 50% chance) without being spotted by any hostiles on the map. DSFs contain large amounts of non-[[Prototype Part|Prototype]] parts in groups of 2-6 that can be any part that can normally appear on the ground for the given depth. Unlike most maps, the ambient temperature in DSFs is -10 rather than 0. This has the effect of giving an additional 10 heat dissipation per turn to all bots on the map.
The overall map layout is semi-fixed. It consists of 2-4 quadrants connected by 2-tile wide corridors In the corner of each quadrant are large Matter Repository machines that will release [[Matter]] when broken. These corridors can have [[Alarm Trap|Alarm Traps]] and [[Stasis Trap|Stasis Traps]] in them but not in the item stockpiles. The exit will never be in the quadrant that Cogmind starts in. In the center of every DSF is a depth-appropriate [[Heavy]], guarding all of the main corridors in the map. Around the Heavy are 4 unpowered [[A-15 Conveyor|A-15 Conveyors]]. The corners of the map can have individual dormant [[Specialist|Specialists]], but not always. There are sometimes groups of 4 prototypes hidden behind emergency access doors in the center of a quadrant, and these prototypes will typically be out-of-depth. Sometimes there is a [[Sentry]] guarding this prototype stockpile.
[[Lore]]0b10 Records|DSF[[/Lore]]
[[Heading]]Mechanics[[/Heading]]
The Heavy in the center of the map makes nearly the entire map relatively unsafe. Although there are no patrols initially, walking through the DSF will quickly get some standard Heavy [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcements]] called on Cogmind. These reinforcements behave no differently than an normal map.
[[Heading:2]]Additional Patrols[[/Heading]]On top of the standard Heavy reinforcements, there are other ways to summon additional patrols. These patrols come in the form of 3 [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]] carrying other bots inside, spaced roughly 80 turns apart. These patrols will come one at a time and remain on the map permanently unless destroyed. These additional patrols can be summoned in one of 3 ways:
[[List]]The Heavy summoning reinforcements: When Cogmind is detected via the Heavy's active scanning, additional patrols will be summoned shortly after.|Terrain destruction: Patrols will be summoned if any of the walls of the DSF are destroyed by any means.|Alarm trap: Patrols will be summoned if an alarm trap is triggered and not jammed using a [[Transmission Jammer]].[[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]Rapid Sterilization[[/Heading]]
After killing around 10 hostiles on the map, rapid sterilization will be engaged. 20 turns after this announcement the ambient heat will rise by 10 and continue to raise by another 10 every 15 turns. This will happen until Cogmind exits the map. This also enables the [[Encrypted Comm Array]] to spawn in the next [[Caves]] if Cogmind does not have a conflicting faction.
[[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]

[[List]](++) Derelict assault group on entry: A group of [[Derelict|Derelicts]] are present on entering the map next to Cogmind. These bots will charge the center of the map, try to kill the heavy, and continue on toward the exit. If any Derelicts survive, they will continue through the exit and show up on the next map.|(++) Derelict assault enters after Cogmind: Similar to the previous event, bots will trickle one at a time onto the map and then wander around the map instead of heading directly toward the exit.|(++) Derelict assault in progress: A much larger Derelict attack force fights a large number of 0b10 bots. This can include prototype 0b10 and Warlord bots, such as [[Striker|Strikers]] and [[Hydra|Hydras]].|(~) Sapper sabotage: 2 [[Sapper|Sappers]] will appear at the start of the map with lots of [[Sapper Charge|Sapper Charges]] on the ground. Large explosions will follow the 2 bots through the map as they head for the exit. For slower propulsion types, do not slow down or else the high damage explosions will reach you.|(~) [[Assembled (4)|Assembled]] infestation: Assembled will appear behind the emergency access doors with a cache of prototype items and roam around the map. They will continue to spawn in greater waves and attack everything in sight. Up to two [[Demolisher]] response squads will be summoned to deal with them.|(~) Wild Derelict Assault: Wild (and hostile) cave Derelicts will attack the DSF from the exit and roam around the map. They will attack 0b10 and Cogmind-allied bots alike.[[/List]]
[[Heading]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There is only one exit in each DSF. Most of the time the exit leads to the next main floor, although it can occasionally lead into a [[Garrison]] on the current depth. If leading to a Garrison, the Garrison exit will not loop back to the same depth again."

"Data Miner","Bot",""
"Data Miner (Location)","Location","The Data Miner location is a [[Caves]] [[Branch]] that appears on either -7 or -6 and is home to the eponymous bot the [[Data Miner]] aka DM. There are no initially hostile bots, but if Data Miner is attacked or the Data Conduit machine is broken he will trigger a trap door to leave the map and 4 dormant [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]] hidden in the walls will wake up and become hostile. If you have any [[Corruption]], make sure to detach all ranged weapons to avoid accidental misfires.
There are 4 unique Terminals on the bottom side of the map. The left 2 contain mostly lore records, although the top-left Terminal will also list the depth of [[Section 7]] as well as the access code to the [[Warlord (Location)|Warlord]] Prototype Stash. These two vary per run so make sure to grab these lore entries every time. The bottom ones do not contain any additional information each run. The top-right Terminal will contain several random bot [[Schematic|Schematics]] and the bottom-right Terminal will contain a large number of part schematics and a few Prototype ID Banks. The part schematics will always contain schematics for [[Combat Drone Bay]] and [[Lgt. Regenerative Plating]].
[[Heading]]Alignment[[/Heading]]
Talking with the Data Miner will result in a permanent alignment bonus that does not have any incompatibilities. [[Investigation Squad|Investigations]] and [[Assault Squad|Assaults]] on all [[0b10]]-controlled floors have a 50% chance to be redirected to another random place on the map if Cogmind is determined as needing assistance. For Assaults, this will result in their permanent repositioning. This is a benefit most of the time, although on cramped maps it can be a downside because bots can be grouped together at chokepoints. However, this effect can only occur if Cogmind's build is in a generally poor state. Additionally, several door terminals will automatically open with the Log message [[GameText]]Door Terminal flashes as you approach.[[/GameText]] This will happen at all of the locked cells in [[Extension]] as well as locked entrance Terminal prefabs to Extension, [[Quarantine]], and all 3 [[Command]] entrance Terminals.
[[Heading:2]]Data Conduit[[/Heading]]
There is a second secret alignment to this map. After the Data Miner is attacked and either destroyed or trap-doored off the map it is possible to step into and use his Data Conduit machine. Doing so will provide many benefits and some major penalties. The rewards are:
[[List]]All obtainable analyses in the game|All [[Prototype Part|Prototype]] IDs|All interactive and non-interactive machine intel|[[Redacted]]The ability to decrypt the [[Lab]] Terminal and see the Lab scanner tiles[[/Redacted]]|[[Redacted]]Manual bot hacking [[Datajacks|Datajack]] codes that can be used to destroy all ""A"" bots on sight[[/Redacted]][[/List]]
The downsides are:
[[List]][[Intercept Squad|Intercepts]] will be dispatched on most 0b10-controlled floors|No more [[Enhanced Grunt]] backup when turning [[Warlord]] hostile on the -2 [[Research]] assault|The group of disabled [[Grunt|Grunts]] in [[Armory]] will turn hostile rather than friendly when awakened|[[Redacted]][[Enhanced Programmer|Enhanced Programmers]] will appear in [[Access_0]][[/Redacted]][[/List]]
The upsides are quite strong but the downsides are very deadly to all but the most prepared Cogmind. [[Tracker|Trackers]] can easily chew up any airborne build with their deadly [[Immobilizer]] to halt any chance of escape with their highly accurate [[Linked Autogun]] to put out the damage. Adequately prepared combat builds can usually dispatch the Trackers without too much trouble and use their Linked Autoguns to great effect. Each Tracker will also summon a [[Combat Programmer]] which is a high-damaging foe that will quickly rack up corruption. Unlike [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]], Intercepts are move-based and not tile-based and tends to punish airborne builds relatively more than combat builds. When using the Data Conduit, Cogmind should either be prepared to exit maps quickly to avoid Intercept encounters or have a plan to fight.
[[Heading]]Fighting[[/Heading]]
Killing the Data Miner himself is highly luck based with only a few ways to improve the chances. A successful Data Miner kill can yield up to 4 pieces of Prototype Hackware at an early depth. Ranged weapons are almost entirely out of the question because he will escape after the first weapon in a volley. However, melee weapon follow-ups will not cause the trap door to activate in between the volley. The primary ways to increase kill chance are to:

[[Heading:2]][[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]][[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Data Miner Combat Dig.png|Digging through the Data Conduit to fight Grunts[[/Image]]
After the Data Miner is attacked these grunts hidden in the wall will burst out and become aggressive. These Grunts have some nice loot for the depth, particularly their [[Neutron Cannon]], [[Adv. Energy Well]], [[Adv. Particle Charger]], and [[Enh. Flexi-carbon Leg|Enh. Flexi-carbon Legs]]. There are several good ways to dispatch these Grunts:
[[Image]]Data Miner Escape Dig.png|Digging through the Data Conduit to escape[[/Image]]
[[List]]Plant [[Dirty Bomb Trap|Dirty Bomb Traps]] next to the Grunt spawn positions. Refer to the empty holes near the top right in the location map up above. They have a minor resistance to EM damage, but a full [[Imp. Trap Extractor]] will typically take out most of them. These can often be found in caves by looting [[Minesweeper|Minesweepers]].|Use 2 or more [[Launchers]] and fight them all at once. Explosive launchers will be slower and provide little to no loot but can have a nice range advantage over the Grunts' below average 14 range. EM launchers have a smaller range but will provide a decent amount of loot, although it will be [[Corrupted Parts|Corrupted]].|Dig a tunnel deep into the Data Conduit machine and hide out inside. The Grunts will spread out over time and you can lure them in to fight 1-on-1. This approach works best with some kind of [[Transmission Jammers|Transmission Jammer]] to avoid drawing more than one Grunt at a time. This is the best tactic to fight Grunts with melee or conventional non-launcher methods.[[/List]]
Another approach is to simply run from the Grunts. This works best for airborne builds as they can get in and out with the fewest number of shots. Digging a tunnel through the Data Conduit machine is also very helpful for escaping. Luring the Grunts into a tunnel as you escape out the other end can avoid most attacks. Flight can hop over the grouped-up Grunts and dodge into the spawn areas to avoid more shots"

They are seen most often in [[Demolisher Squad|Demolisher Squads]] to deal with infestations and as part of an [[Assault Squad]] if Cogmind has allies. They have heavy resistance to explosive damage, so they don't take much damage from their own explosions. Demolishers are extremely dangerous as they can deal out damage very quickly to Cogmind and any allies. Their tendency to destroy terrain can make repositioning difficult and can often reveal Cogmind's location to other hostiles.
Demolishers are one of the scariest standard 0b10 bots to fight head on. Their massive damage and high resistance (or immunity) to their own attacks means that they won't be harmed much by blowing themselves up. Their Shock Absorption Systems are fairly frail, and if those are destroyed they will take much more damage from self explosions. [[Antimissile Systems]] are very useful at cutting down Demolisher damage by intercepting their missiles. Demolishers don't have any particular weakness, so use any non-Explosive damage type available to take them out as quickly as possible.

"Encrypted Comm Array","Part","The Encrypted Comm Array, or ECA, is a [[Warlord]]-aligned item that enables summoning various groups of [[Derelict]] allies on main [[0b10]] floors. It can be obtained by performing any of the actions that increase the ECA force multiplier listed below. After this, a Derelict will appear in the next [[Caves]] map and deliver the Array, give some more details on its usage, and reveal the depth of [[Warlord (Location)]]. The ECA cannot be used if Cogmind has been [[Imprint|Imprinted]] or made use of a [[RIF|RIF installer]], as these alignments are mutually exclusive with Warlord.
[[Heading]]Summoning squads[[/Heading]]
Equipping the ECA on any main 0b10 floor will reveal up to 8 squads available for summoning. Each time a squad is summoned, the force multiplier is decreased by 0.01. Moving over one of the squad indicators on the map will summon several white colored [[Alert]]-free allies that will follow Cogmind around the map, but will not follow to any other maps. These bots also do not gain trap location knowledge from Cogmind like purple or blue allies, so they may move over known traps. The squads do not get stronger as depth increases, so they have less utility in late [[Factory]] and [[Research]] depths. All squads have a chance of containing a [[Surgeon]] that will repair any allied bots as well as Cogmind. The available squads are:
[[List]]Chimera Squad: [[Mutant|Mutants]]|Dakka Squad: [[Wasp|Wasps]]|Muscle Squad: [[Butcher|Butchers]] and [[Savage|Savages]]|Geek Squad: [[Wizard|Wizards]]|Ghost Squad: [[Infiltrator|Infiltrators]]|Infantry Squad: [[Thug|Thugs]]|Pyro Squad: [[Fireman|Firemen]]|Ranger Squad: [[Guerrilla|Guerrillas]][[/List]]
If Cogmind meets Warlord at his base, the squad summoning and force multiplier reporting mechanics stop functioning, and there is no point to hold onto the ECA any longer.
[[Heading]]Force multiplier[[/Heading]]
The ECA brings an additional mechanic to Warlord alignment called the force multiplier. This value is reported every time Cogmind enters a new main 0b10 depth. The force multiplier affects several things:
[[List]]The total number of squads available to summon per map. This starts at 0 squads at a 1.00 force multiplier and caps at 8 at 1.08.|Special guard squads in the -2 [[Research]] Warlord assault event. Based on the performance tier, more bots and stronger squads can be summoned to aid Cogmind during the assault.|-1 [[Access]] spillover forces: In Access, additional Warlord forces will appear at the entrance to the map. More squads will appear with a higher force multiplier.|[[Redacted]]The [[Command]] seals will summon more and stronger bots based on the overall force multiplier.[[/Redacted]][[/List]]
The force multiplier tiers are as follows:
[[List]]D: 1.00 - 1.09|C: 1.10 - 1.19|B: 1.20 - 1.29|A: 1.30 - 1.39|S: 1.40+[[/List]]
The following are the ways that the force multiplier can be modified:
[[Table]]Method|Effect||Sterilizing a DSF|+ 0.10||Garrison interior compromised (once per Garrison)|+ 0.02||Destroying a RIF installer|+ 0.02||Destroying a Garrison Relay|+ 0.01||Destroying a Phase Generator|+ 0.01||Summoning an ECA squad|- 0.01||Ascending a depth|- 0.01[[/Table]]
[[Heading]]Additional abilities[[/Heading]]
The ECA has a unique ability that interacts with [[Heavy]]-summoned [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcement Squads]]. Occasionally, [[Specialist|Specialists]] summoned by the Heavy will reveal themselves to be [[Infiltrator|Infiltrators]] in disguise and turn friendly to Cogmind.
[[Heading]]Post-Warlord RIF[[/Heading]]
It is possible to install RIF after meeting Warlord. Warlord and his forces will not turn against Cogmind at this point, as they can only detect RIF inside of the Warlord base. However, doing so will lose some of the benefits. The -2 special guards will not appear based on the force multiplier. [[Redacted]]Additionally, fewer squads will be dispatched to follow Cogmind around from the Command seals. However, the seals will still have a higher number and more powerful bots based on the force multiplier as usual.[[/Redacted]]"

Description[[/Table]]"
"Executioner","Bot",""
"Exiles (Group)","Bot Group","The Exiles are a group of 3 [[Tinkerer]]-like bots and their bodyguard [[8R-AWN]] stationed at [[Exiles (Location)]] that have been exiled from [[Zion]].
[[EX-DEC]] wields their [[AWS/EX-DEC]] and [[8R-AWN]] wields 2 [[8R-AWN's Boregun|Boreguns]] and may fight if provoked, but the others are unarmed. They have developed a large number of unique prototype parts."
"Exiles (Location)","Location","The Exiles map appears as a [[Branch]] off of [[Mines]] on either -10 or -9 and is home to the Exiles, a group of friendly Derelict Tinkerer outcasts made up of [[EX-BIN]], [[EX-DEC]], [[EX-HEX]], and their bodyguard [[8R-AWN]]. These Exiles have a large collection of unique prototype parts that are only available in the Exiles vault. The entrance is guarded by some rigged engines that blow up when a hostile bot crosses them. There are some lore terminals with entries written by each of the tinkerers that describe many of the prototype parts obtainable on this map as well as some that are not. The terminal near the center of the map also contains a log entry that points to the depth that [[Zion]] is on. Various caches of storage units and energy/matter storage can be found throughout the map. ""The Gauntlet"" at the bottom of the map is a stretch of tester bots that are working on the latest batch of prototype parts. These Derelicts have names that reference Cogmind community members. This map is also home to the [[Farcom]] aligner machine and a unique alignment.
Carrying a [[Datajack]] into this map can be a good idea due to all of the prototype parts that the Exiles and 8R-AWN have on them. Parsing them will provide the associated prototype part IDs so you can recognize the parts later.
Be wary of [[Corruption]] on this map. There is rarely any way to cleanse corruption this early in the game, and misfires are possible at even 1% corruption. One misfire hitting the wrong thing will result in the whole map turning aggressive and death will likely follow. Detaching all ranged weapons is recommended if Cogmind has any corruption.
[[Heading]]Alignment[[/Heading]]
Using the [[Farcom]] machine grants an 18-radius permanent combat hostile sensor in any [[0b10]] controlled maps and one of the special vault items. If Farcom abilities are retained, entering any [[Research]] branches will have massive consequences. Other than that, Farcom can provide some great advantages to help players with permanent itemless sensor abilities.
3 random items will be present in the vault in most games. Here is the list of Exiles specific vault items that can be obtained with Farcom:[[List]][[0b10 Alert Chip]]|[[Army-in-a-Box]]|[[AWS/Autocannon]]|[[AWS/Gauss]]|[[AWS/Thermal]]|[[Chronowheel]]|[[Cloak of Protection]]|3 [[Deploy-a-Sentry]]|[[Field Lobotomy Kit]]|[[Firepult]]|[[Flying Fortress v7]]|[[Gui.

[[Heading:2]]Alignment Options[[/Heading]]
There are more ways to interact with Farcom without just taking a single vault item. Here are all of the outcomes:[[List]]Use Farcom machine, take 0-1 vault items: Permanently gain Farcom and the use of the vault item taken.|Use Farcom machine, take 2-3 vault items: Gain Farcom until [[Factory]] is reached. After that, the Exiles notice that you are a thief and will remove Farcom. [[Master Thief|Master Thieves]] will sometimes ambush you at the entrance/exits in [[Caves]] maps and rip parts off of your body and from your inventory. They will prioritize high rating parts and Exiles prototypes.|Use Farcom machine (or don't), attack Exiles and leave the map with 0 vault items: Lose Farcom instantly. The Exiles will become aggressive and send [[Assembled (4)|Assembled]], a [[DAS Turret]], and [[8R-AWN]] to kill you. After leaving the map, there is a chance that a hostile [[Z-Hero]] will spawn and attack you. Note: Using vault items on the map is safe as long as no items actually leave the map.|Use Farcom machine, attack Exiles and leave the map with 1 or more vault items: The same as above except you get Master Thieves in caves as described above.[[/List]]
[[Heading]]Variations[[/Heading]]
There are several variations of the Exiles map that can change things dramatically. In the majority of maps, the Exiles are present. However, there are 2 possible variations in the maps:
[[Image]]Exiles Attacked.png|Attacked Exiles vault[[/Image]][[List]]Abandoned Exiles: In this map, the Exiles have all fled the map and taken nearly everything on the map as well. Neither Farcom nor any vault items are obtainable in this seed. However, EX-DEC may be found in [[Spoiler]][[Warlord (Location)|Warlord]] in the Vortex Lab[[/Spoiler]] in these seeds.|Attacked Exiles: In this map, the Exiles have been attacked and are missing. There are disabled and rewirable bots on the map and random parts on the ground. Farcom is not obtainable on this seed, but one random vault prototype is available by using the manual code [[Spoiler]][[GameText]]\\1234[[/GameText]][[/Spoiler]] on the vault terminal.|While not changing the map in any way, there is a chance that a large [[0b10]] attack force will assault the Exiles base after using the Farcom machine and exiting the vault.[[/List]]
[[Heading]]Fighting[[/Heading]]
Fighting the Exiles is a challenging yet rewarding endeavor. Although they are normally friendly, they can pack quite a punch and will likely end the run of any unprepared player. As far as rewards go, [[8R-AWN]] has some powerful unique [[8R-AWN's Boregun|Boreguns]] with a high salvage and destroy critical %, out-of-depth parts including [[Exp. Heat Sink]], [[Adv. Weapon Cycler]], [[Exp. Targeting Computer]], and [[Adv. Myomer Leg]]. Another unique part, the [[AS-neutralizer No. 17b]] is very helpful in a later game branch [[Zion Deep Caves]]. Other useful parts on some of the Exiles themselves are [[Adv. Component Analysis Suite]], [[System Purifier]], [[Cmb. Antigrav System]], [[Imp. Armor Integrity Analyzer]], [[Exp. Core Analyzer]], and [[Adv. Transmission Jammer]].
[[Image]]Exiles Kill Build.png|Example Exiles kill build[[/Image]]
Fighting the Exiles is not recommended on -10 due to lower slot count, lower core integrity, and difficulty in getting enough integrity to survive the 8R-AWN fight. If fighting on -9, evolving a 3rd weapon slot can be very effective in killing 8R-AWN and any potential [[Z-Hero|Z-Heroes]] that might spawn in the next Mines map. The third weapon slot is not required to kill by any means, however, and any combination of weapon, utility, and propulsion slots for the evolve will work. As a basic checklist, the following parts are recommended:[[List]]Multiple kinetic guns with backups, ideally [[Hvy. Assault Rifle|Hvy. Assault Rifles]] or [[Imp. Assault Rifle|Imp. Assault Rifles]], weapons with negative salvage like [[Shotgun]] or a ballistic cannon like [[Imp. Light Cannon]] can work but 8R-AWN has very strong loot that is nice to get if possible|Multiple pieces of armor, preferably [[Hrd. Light Armor Plating]] or [[Med. Armor Plating]]|Multiple [[Lgt. Treads]] or [[Imp. Treads]] with backups|At least one launcher like [[Grenade Launcher]], [[Mni. Grenade Launcher]], or [[Rocket Launcher]]|(Optional) A way to gain positive salvage like a [[Salvage Targeting Computer]] can provide a better chance at part drops|(Optional) [[Blade Trap|Blade Traps]] for 8R-AWN, if an early trap extractor or trap stockpile are found in Mines. IMPORTANT: Do not install more than one trap until after the attack has begun. Exiles will give a warning if a trap is installed, and immediately turn on Cogmind if a second is installed.|(Optional) [[Thief Drone Bay]] trivializes the 8R-AWN fight. Make sure that you have aggro (he is shooting you), then release the drones. They will rip off parts very quickly and leave them defenseless.[[/List]]
[[Image]]Exiles Kill.png|A visual guide to killing the Exiles[[/Image]]
There are some things that should be done before actually doing the fight itself. The image on the right serves as a visual reference. Any rigged engines used must be in inventory before attacking the Exiles, otherwise the engines will still remain loyal to the Exiles and explode only on Cogmind. Matter pods should be relocated near the 8R-AWN fighting spot (See point #4 in diagram) to avoid running out of matter in combat. Any allies should be told to stay in the same general area so they can contribute to the fight. However, Grunts can't deal much damage until [[8R-AWN's Armor/TH]] is destroyed. Finally, some vault items may come in handy for the fight. The [[Cloak of Protection]]'s effect is not so strong, but when turned off it is a high coverage high integrity piece of armor. The [[Longsword +1]] is a very effective kill tool. The [[Potential Leg|Potential Legs]] have a lot of integrity in case you run out of propulsion during the fight. The [[Gui. Plasma Cannon]] may be used to safely destroy the [[DAS Turret]] without getting attacked back. One thing to consider about the vault is that there may be a 0b10 attack on the Exiles after exiting. In those cases, an Exiles kill may either have to be cancelled or at least turned into a 8R-AWN only kill. Aside from that, the fight may begin:
[[Image]]Exiles Launcher DAS.png|Launchering the DAS turret[[/Image]]
[[List:Ordered]]Shoot one of the spike-shaped machines to turn the Exiles hostile.|Drop the rigged engines from the entrance every few tiles while walking toward the spot for step #3, they have an explosion radius of 2. This will take care of most of the Assembled that are coming your way. IMPORTANT: This must be done after the Exiles become hostile. If you do it before that, they will explode on Cogmind.|Pull out a Launcher and dispose of the remaining Assembled.|Go to the corner to fight 8R-AWN. If you have any blade traps, now is the time to use them. Place them just above the bottom-most wall to the right of the spot marked 4. This is the part that needs the most backups, as 8R-AWN will destroy many of your parts very quickly due to high damage and high part destroy critical chance. Always put on backup parts right away after they are destroyed.You may run out of matter and have to refill from matter pods at this point, which is why preemptively moving the matter pods here can be very important. Many kill attempts that don't have enough damage or integrity will end here.|Hopefully you have some good loot after 8R-AWN is destroyed. [[8R-AWN's Boregun|Boreguns]] are a very easy way to destroy the [[DAS Turret]]. Penetrate through the machines to try and kill the turret without getting shot at because the cannon deals incredibly high damage. If no Boreguns were dropped, using a launcher is another good option. The idea is to aim around the spike in the machine so that you can't get hit but the explosion radius will still hit the turret.|Finally, all that is left is to loot the Exiles and their Derelict friends. Otherwise just finish them off with whatever you have left. Watch out for [[EX-DEC]] as they have a deadly [[AWS/EX-DEC]] that can deal a lot of damage very quickly if you aren't careful. It has a short range, so just take them out from a distance.[[/List]]"

"Extension","Location","Extension is an [[0b10]]-controlled [[Factory]] [[Branch]] that appears between -6 and -4 and serves as a connection between the main [[0b10]] complex and [[Cetus]]. It is the beginning of a 4-map sequences of branches that spans Extension, Cetus, [[Archives]], and [[Hub_04(d)]]. It is an 0b10-controlled map with a small amount of patrols and moderate amount of guards spread throughout. There are a large amount of non-combat hostiles moving in between [[Transfer Station|Transfer Stations]] at the left and right-most parts of the map. Unlike most 0b10-controlled maps, [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]] will not spawn in Extension. The central area is heavily guarded with 2 [[Behemoth|Behemoths]] and 2 [[Sentry|Sentries]] standing by.
The overall map shape is similar to a large B turned on its side. This map shape is the same between runs, although every map has random contents. There is a single bottom path that runs straight to the main Factory/Cetus exits and 2 branching paths that contain some machines and disabled and imprisoned [[Derelict|Derelicts]]. One special NPC, [[A7]], is nearly always guaranteed to be locked in one of the cells. The central area has the aforementioned guards stationed as well as a [[Terminal]]-locked exit. The bottom path to either side of the central area can have Emergency Access doors along the top or bottom of the path. These can contain hostile guards, part caches, or nothing.
One unique mechanic to Extension is the persistent threat check. If too many non-combat hostiles are attacked and destroyed, an alert with the text [[GameText]]ALERT: Persistent threat to transfer network, dispatching additional forces.[[/GameText]] will appear, and 2 [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]] will be dispatched to patrol the map.
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
There are two types of special machines in Extension. The first, the Transfer Station, is a machine that normally transports non-combat hostiles. When destroyed, each one will reduce the number of non-combat robots on all 0b10-controlled maps by a stacking 50% amount. Note that this does not include [[Researcher|Researchers]]. The other, Energy Cyclers, will open all Sealed Heavy Doors simultaneously when destroyed and summon several ARCs to patrol the map. This will free all of the locked up Derelicts and they will start heading in Cogmind's direction, fighting every hostile they see. Destroying either of these machines can be either good or bad, although the energy cycler effect is almost always bad.
[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]
[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Extension[[/Lore]]
[[Heading]]Strategy[[/Heading]]The strategy for Extension is a fairly simple one. From the spawn location, take the path to the top-left of the map. Travel along the right and destroy any hostiles. Rewiring and freeing bots in cells is an option at this point, but it is usually better to wait to do this to keep [[Alert]] lower and to preserve ally integrity for the center fight. When you reach the center area where the only path is down, there are 2 primary options:
[[List]]Head back and loop back around counter-clockwise to the center of the map. Free/rewire any allies along the way. Take on the first Behemoth alone, then keep moving forward with your allies to finish the rest of the center area off.|Dig through the top-center part of the map. This is about 10 tiles long and is a risky dig with a high chance of one or more cave-ins. For a build with no allies and no good way to take on the central area, this may be a better risk to take than a head-on fight.[[/List]]
After that, clear the top right section of the map to collect as many allies as possible, then head to the exits.

There are 2 exits right next to each other. The layout is always the same: The top path leads to Cetus and the lower path leads back to the next main floor, either Factory or Research.
[[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]
[[List]](++) Derelict attack: There is an extremely rare event in which a large group of Derelicts attack Extension. The trigger conditions for this event are unknown.[[/List]]"
"Extermination Squad","Other","[[Image]]Extermination Squad.png|An Extermination Squad hunting down Cogmind[[/Image]]
Extermination squads are [[0b10]] aligned [[Squad|squads]] that are sent after Cogmind periodically in [[Factory]] (-7) and beyond. Exterminations are sent directly to Cogmind with [[Perfect Tracking]] and cannot easily be shaken. Extermination squads typically consist of 1-3 [[Programmer|Programmers]] based on the floor: 1 [[P-60 Hacker]] on -7 and -6, 1 or 2 [[P-70 Sage|P-70 Sages]] on -5 and -4, and 2 or 3 [[P-80 Master|P-80 Masters]] on -3 to -1. Extermination squads can be both Enumerated and Recalled at [[Terminal|Terminals]].
An alert will indicate whenever an an Extermination squad is dispatched. Additionally, the log will display a message like [[GameText]]ALERT: Rogue bot located, Programmers report to Factory Zone 5B.[[/GameText]]
[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]
[[Lore]]WAR.Sys Records|Extermination Squad[[/Lore]]
[[Heading]]Frequency[[/Heading]]
Extermination squads have a chance of being dispatched by every 250 turns when on most 0b10 maps. The higher the depth, the higher the chance that an Extermination will be sent. If Exterminations fail to be sent 3 times in a row, one will be sent after 1/3 of the average check time. For example, if no Extermination squad is sent for 750 turns, one will be sent in 1/3 of 250 turns, which is 84 turns, or 834 turns total. This means that there are 4 possible combinations of delay between Extermination squads.
The spawn timer can be delayed with [[Spoiler]]the [[RIF]] ability Zone Cloak[[/Spoiler]] or by sealing [[Garrison (Machine)|Garrison Machines]]. Both of these methods stack, and each provides +75 turns to each possible Extermination squad spawn. For example, closing 2 Garrisons while having [[Spoiler]]Zone Cloak 1[[/Spoiler]] will add 225 turns to the 250 turn timer, increasing it up to 475 turns.
The following table showcases possible time periods in between Extermination squads.
[[Table]]# delay sources (e.g. sealed Garrisons)|1st spawn chance|2nd|3rd|Latest possible||0|250|500|750|834||1|325|650|975|1084||2|400|800|1200|1334||3|475|950|1425|1584||4|550|1100|1650|1837[[/Table]]
[[Spoiler]][[Heading]][[Q-Series]][[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Q-Series.png|2 Q-Series coming for Cogmind[[/Image]]
It is possible for Extermination Programmers to be replaced by 1-2 Q-Series instead. This can occur randomly if Cogmind gets scanned by a [[Researcher]] in [[Testing]] or [[Quarantine]]. These Q-Series have customized and randomized loadouts, but will behave in the same way as regular Extermination squads do. This includes heading straight for Cogmind with perfect tracking, and the ability to be recalled at Terminals.[[/Spoiler]]"
"F-cell Engine","Part",""
"Fabricator","Other","Fabricators construct parts and robots based on schematics. [[Schematic|Schematics]] can be acquired by using [[Scanalyzer|Scanalyzers]] or hacking [[Terminal|Terminals]] (see your status page for access to a list of schematics currently in your possession), then loaded into a fabricator which will report the resources it requires to complete construction. Starting another build on a busy fabricator will cancel the current construction. Loading a new schematic and printing it will summon an [[Investigation Squad]], unless you have the appropriate [[Authchips|Authchip]].

Building bots will build multiple.

Higher security fabricators are capable of much faster construction. 

[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]
[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Fabricator[[/Lore]]"
"Factory","Location","Factory is a [[0b10]]-controlled main floor that occurs on every floor between -7 and -4. It is the beginning of the midgame where the game really starts to open up. In stark contrast with earlier [[Materials]] maps, Factory start out huge with a ~200x200 tile map size. The rooms, the corridors, and the overall layout are all much wider and more open and connected than Materials. The patrols and guards are more spread out and stealth play with airborne propulsion and [[Infowar]] becomes a strong gameplay option.
[[Alert]] starts to be more of a concern as the maps become bigger and harder to traverse. [[Hackware]] is useful to be able to successfully use Access hacks at terminals to locate exits. [[Signal Interpreter|Signal Interpreters]] will also be more useful at identifying exits as the exit types will be less predictable. [[Caves]] exits are available in every Factory map. They can be difficult if a player is unprepared, but they can provide many unique rewards and will typically result in a complete Alert purge by the time Cogmind makes it back to the next main floor.
As [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]] become a regular occurrence, a large part of a build's effectiveness becomes how quickly Cogmind can kill Programmers. [[Corruption]] can build up very quickly if fighting multiple Programmers in open areas without a good way to kill them. Having strong thermal or kinetic weaponry is a good way to destroy them quickly. For lighter airborne builds, non-Impact melee weapons can work, although using Hackware to recall Exterminations is also very effective. This tends to be more important in later depths as Exterminations will upgrade from a single [[P-60 Hacker]] to 1-2 [[P-70 Sage]] per squad.
There are many new mechanics introduced beginning in Factory floors:

[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There are 4 types of main exits on Factory floors:
[[List]]Main access exits: These always lead to the next main floor, either Factory or [[Research]]. Sometimes these exits can be identifiable by a 5 tile wide corridor leading to a dead-end with the exit in the middle. All other types of exits that aren't a part of a prefab can be either a main or branch exit. There will always be 4 of these exits per Factory map.|[[Caves]] exit: These exits can never be identified purely by looks. Using a [[Signal Interpreter]] or access hack to identify exits are the main ways to do so. There will always be 2 of these exits per Factory map.|[[Spoiler]][[Extension]] exit: Extension can always be identified by a distinctive prefab where a large area is sealed off by orange Blast Doors. These doors can be open or locked. If locked, the nearby [[Terminal]] will have an Open hack available to open the doors. Otherwise, shooting the walls open with strong thermal weaponry, causing an engine detonation with an EM launcher, or strong melee attacks can dig through or around these doors. Factory maps at the same depth as Extension will have 2 Extension exits.[[/Spoiler]]|[[Spoiler]][[Armory]] exit: Armory can always be identified in Factory by a large 5 tile corridor leading into a 3 tile doorway. These exits will always be heavily guarded by a mix of [[Y-72 Warden|Sentries]] and [[G-67 Veteran|Grunts]] and have large stockpiles of weapons nearby. Factory maps at the same depth as Armory will have 1 of these types of exit.[[/Spoiler]][[/List]]
[[Image]]Factory DSF Exit.png|Hacked open DSF exit[[/Image]]
Several non-standard exits also appear in Factory. [[Chute Trap|Chute Traps]] will throw Cogmind into [[Wastes]] which can end many good runs if unprepared. Using a [[Datajack]] on a [[K-01 Serf|Serf]] for the find_chute hack is very effective to either reveal traps to avoid or areas to head toward if planning to take on the [[C-40 Crusher|Crushers]] in combat. The other type of exit is a [[DSF]]. These exits can be hacked open at distinctive DSF terminals but will automatically lock upon being spotted by any hostile. Stealth or good luck is required to make it to these exits."

[[Image]]Farcom.gif|Using the Farcom Aligner machine[[/Image]]
Farcom is one of the major faction [[Alignment|alignments]] available to Cogmind in most runs. Taking Farcom aligns Cogmind with the [[Exiles (Group)]] for the rest of the game. It provides a permanent 18 tile radius sensor for hostile [[0b10]] bots within 0b10 controlled map. This sensor cannot be jammed by [[Watcher|Watchers]] or masked by [[Heavy|Heavies]] unlike standard [[Sensor Arrays]]. The primary limitation of the Farcom sensor is that it doesn't work in any [[Caves]] branches. One other side-effect is that entering specific [[Research]] branches becomes much more dangerous. Occasionally the Exiles may have been abandoned or attacked, and Farcom is not an option in these runs.
[[Heading:2]]Gaining Farcom[[/Heading]]
Taking Farcom can be done in most runs in the [[Exiles (Location)|Exiles]] map off of either -10 or -9 [[Mines]]. After talking to [[EX-BIN]], walk into the Farcom Aligner machine. Cogmind can take up to 1 special vault item (or multiples of the same type). If Cogmind takes more than 1 type of item then the Exiles will notice you stealing when entering [[Factory]] and Farcom will be removed. Also, becoming hostile to the Exiles will result in instantly losing Farcom. If Cogmind takes Farcom, it is not possible to [[Imprint]]: [[Spoiler]]The [[Imprinter]] will be disappointed in Cogmind and warn you to leave right away. Attempting to use the Imprinting machine will result in turning all the bots at [[Zion]] hostile. There are no other alignment restrictions with Farcom.[[/Spoiler]]
[[Heading:2]]Research Branch side-effect[[/Heading]]
When entering -3 Research, the Exiles will send a warning message to Cogmind indicating not to enter Research branches. If Cogmind does anyway, [[Spoiler]]immediately when entering [[Testing]], [[Quarantine]], or [[Section 7]], [[Maximum Security]] will instantly be triggered. Note that this does not include [[Armory]] when it is on -3. The immediate response is machines shut down right after entering the level, 4 [[Sentry]] spawns at each [[Garrison]] and exit, and 6 Assault [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]] sent at Cogmind shortly after. Unless Cogmind is prepared to fight off large waves of enemies or outrun them, these maps should not be entered.[[/Spoiler]]"

"GOLEM Unit","Part","GOLEM Units are unique utilities found in the [[Zion Deep Caves]]. They are contained within the GOLEM Chambers found in the western wall. When attached and activated, they will produce a variety of assembled parts if there are empty slots available. While being integrated, these assembled parts have no effect and 0 coverage. These parts increase by 3 integrity every turn, and become active when their current integrity reaches 100% of maximum. Parts are built in the following order, assuming all slots are empty:
[[Image]]Golem Parts.png|A full GOLEM loadout[[/Image]]
[[Table]]Part|Turns to build part|Total time to build||[[Asb. Alloy Leg]] #1|133|133||[[Asb. Flux Generator]]|117|250||Asb. Alloy Leg #2|133|383||[[Asb. Biocell Array]] #1|17|400||[[Asb.

Biocell Array on Cogmind's body, though, as they are both of the same slot type (utility).

It may also be wise to carry an extra power source or significant energy storage, because rebuilding a destroyed Asb. Flux Generator in hostile conditions may be difficult or excessively dangerous, due to the time cost involved."

"Garrison","Location","Garrison is a [[0b10]]-controlled sub-floor available from all main maps and several 0b10 branches from -9 to -1. It can only appear on -9 as a [[Storage]] Garrison, but can appear in [[Materials]] starting at -8, [[Factory]], [[Research]], and [[Access]]. Other branches that can have Garrison entrances on them are [[Hub_04(d)]], [[Testing]], [[Quarantine]], and [[Section 7]]. Garrisons are very combat hostile-dense maps, with a few patrols and a large number of guard posts that will automatically open to reveal their contents if Cogmind or an ally is nearby.
Every Garrison has a center square area with 4 guard ""checkpoints"" and is often guarded by a [[Behemoth]]. There are 4 wings of the Garrison extending past the center area dividing into the top left, top right, bottom right, and bottom left segments of the map. Each wing that Cogmind did not spawn in contains an exit, although exits may be locked if Cogmind is not [[RIF]]-aligned. The wings have many random variations that can contain part stockpiles, rewirable bots, Phase Generators, Garrison Relays, trapped Derelicts, and additional guards. At least one of the wings will contain a RIF installer.
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
There are several unique types of machines in Garrisons.
[[Heading:3]]Garrison Relay[[/Heading]]
Garrison Relays are machines located in each wing of the Garrison and contain 3-5 [[Relay Couplers]] that will be released if the machine is destroyed. If Cogmind is not RIF-aligned, destroying Garrison Relays will decrease the chance of exits being locked.
[[Heading:3]]Phase Generator[[/Heading]]
Phase Generators are explosive machines that are responsible for maintaining phase walls and stopping normal [[Sensor Arrays]], [[Terrain Scanners]], and the [[Structural Scanner]] from working. [[Active Sensor Suite]], the [[Seismic Detector]], and the [[Triangulator]] do work, however. If destroyed, all phase walls will be removed and sensor and terrain scanning functionality will be restored. This behavior does not change even if there are multiple Phase Generators in the same Garrison. Destroying a second does not have any additional effect, other than cause a large explosion. Phase Generators are not guaranteed to appear on any Garrison. When they do show up, they are often hidden behind phase walls or emergency access doors, although they may be located via audio cues as the loud machine can be heard through walls.
[[Heading:3]]Phase Wall[[/Heading]]
While not a machine, Phase Walls are special tiles that are powered by Phase Generators. They are not normally visible unless Cogmind has the Structural Interface RIF ability. They have less armor than standard Garrison walls, although this is not revealed unless Cogmind becomes aware of them by some means. Any bot standing in a phase wall will get a free 50% force field-like damage reduction. Cogmind cannot walk in one normally without Structural Interface. However, it is possible to ram a bot out of a phase wall to gain the shielding.
[[Heading:3]]RIF installer[[/Heading]]
There is always at least one RIF installer per Garrison, with a chance of a second. They may be hidden behind phase walls and emergency accesses and not easily visible. Stepping into the middle of one will first cause Cogmind to become RIF-aligned if there are no other conflicting alignments. [[Imprint|Imprinting]] and using a [[Core Reset Matrix]] will cause Cogmind to be unable to use a RIF installer. If Cogmind is already RIF-aligned, Cogmind will either gain a new [[~/rif.html|RIF ability]] or increase the level in an existing one. The machine itself is quite fragile, so be careful for [[Corruption]]-induced misfires or explosive traps destroying the machine before use.
[[Heading:2]]Patrols/Guards[[/Heading]]
The following bot types can appear as patrols in Garrisons:
[[List]][[C-30 ARC|ARCs]]|[[Brawler|Brawlers]]|[[Cutter|Cutters]]|[[Duelist|Duelists]]|[[Hunter|Hunters]]|[[Grunt|Grunts]]|[[Swarmer|Swarmers]]|[[Programmer|Programmers]][[/List]]
The following bot types can appear as guards inside checkpoints:
[[List]]ARCs (up to 4 can appear, although all but one will be unpowered|Brawlers|[[Demolisher]] + [[Protector]] combo|Duelists|Hunters|Grunts|Swarmers|[[Sentry|Sentries]]|[[Specialist|Specialists]][[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]Active scanning[[/Heading]]
Active Sensor Suites may bypass the Phase Generator to allow seeing all bots inside the Garrison. However, there is a downside to this. After scanning a few bots, a log message [[GameText]]ALERT: Active scanning activity detected within garrison interior, activating patrols.[[/GameText]] will appear. After this, all dormant bots will be activated, every checkpoint will be raised, and all guard bots will be sent to roam around the map randomly to search for hostiles. While the sensor effect is quite strong, the downsides are quite large and may not be worth the hassle of all the bots being released at the same time.
[[Heading:2]]Interior Compromised[[/Heading]]
After 1200 turns in a Garrison, if not triggered by another special event, the following message will be logged [[GameText]]ALERT: Garrison interior compromised[[/GameText]]. This also comes with a 100 [[Alert]] increase. After that initial 1200 turns, this message and Alert gain will repeat after 600, 300, and finally every further 150 turns. The first Garrison compromised message will trigger the [[Encrypted Comm Array]] to spawn in the next [[Caves]] map if Cogmind does not have an incompatible faction. Destroying various Garrison-specific machines will contribute to the multiplier.

[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There are always at least 3 exits per Garrison, the main 3 of which all lead to the same map. If RIF-aligned, all of the exits will always be available. Otherwise, exits may lock when trying to use them. Destroying Garrison Relays will lower the chance that the exits will lock on use. Only 2/3 of the main exits may lock, so it is not possible to get stuck on the map. There are 3 possibilities for Garrison exits:
[[List]]""Looping"": A Garrison may exit back to a new map at the original depth. This can happen as long as the Garrison wasn't entered from a DSF and a RIF installer wasn't used on a previous Garrison.|0b10-controlled branch: The following 0b10 branches are possible Garrison exit targets: [[Testing]], [[Quarantine]], and [[Redacted]][[Section 7]] only when entering a Garrison from Testing or Quarantine when Section 7 is on the same depth.[[/Redacted]]|0b10-controlled main floor: The exit continues onto the next main 0b10 depth.[[/List]]
There is also a special ""looping"" exit that will always loop or lead to a 0b10-controlled branch exit if available. This exit only rarely appears. It allows looping more than one time per depth even if a RIF installer has been used in a previous Garrison.
[[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]
[[List]](+) Derelict assault: Shortly after entering the map, the interior compromised alert plays and a group of Derelicts will appear randomly at an exit. They will wander through the Garrison randomly, looking for fights.|(+) Cache delivery: An [[A-27 Freighter]] will deliver an inventory full of parts to a guarded prefab.

Rewirable and unpowered 0b10 and Assembled bots are scattered across the map, and random items appear on the ground. Some of the Garrison's machines and walls will be destroyed at random. The Garrison infiltrated message will appear shortly after entering the map.|(+) [[Sapper]] sabotage: A Sapper will plant a [[Sapper Charge]] near a Phase Generator, causing it to blow up soon after|(~) Assembled infestation: Shortly after entering the map, a message will appear in the log [[GameText]]Infestation breaching garrison interior.

More Assembled will continue to spawn from the original location.|(~) Dispatches: Either an Investigation squad, a Heavy, or 1-2 Q-Series will be summoned to the nearest exit. In the case of an Investigation squad, existing bots in a checkpoint on the map will exit. Heavies and Q-Series will spawn out of the Heavy/Q-Series Assembler machine.|(~) Coupler Programmer: A higher than usual rating Programmer will appear from an exit and roam around the map for a few hundred turns before leaving through a different exit.[[/List]]

Old wiki port, information may be outdated
[[Heading]]What does a Garrison Access Machine do?[[/Heading]]
Dispatched combat squads may now instead come from a garrison instead of a regular access point, especially if located closer to the target area. So for those of you being bad robots (all of you!), you'll notice enemy response times have gone down. Also, unlike normal access points where the game has been nice about not allowing hostiles to enter through them when you're nearby, hostiles can emerge from a garrison even if you're sitting right next to it! No loitering, please. But wait, there's more...
Combat robots being attacked in the vicinity of a garrison may call for backup. Knowing this you probably don't want to engage targets stationed at or passing by one these places. Unless of course... you're carrying a [[Transmission Jammer]] ;).
Even unarmed non-hostile robots might report you and call a nearby garrison for rescue if you shoot them (and they survive =p) while close enough. If you can leave the area quickly enough that won't be a problem, though, since the garrison squad will only head to and monitor the area around the reported disturbance.
Of course, garrisons can't spit out hostiles indefinitely. There is a delay before a given garrison will respond to another event, and even some types of responses don't come all at once--a single response might be spread out over time, another reason to not hang around, unless your plan is to attack it :D 
[[Heading]]Hacking a Garrison[[/Heading]]
Like everything Cogmind, there are always multiple strategic aspects to a feature, and hacking helps add more dimensions to this reinforcement mechanic, or as you'll eventually discover, even turn it on the enemy! This is where things really get interesting...

[[Heading]]Attacking a Garrison[[/Heading]]
Garrisons are a flavorful addition to the world that come with a number of unique mechanics, benefits, and drawbacks. They're your chance to take the battle to the enemy--think of it as you entering that building lobby in The Matrix :D
[[Heading]]Some beneficial reasons to visit a garrison:[[/Heading]]
[[List]]Gain allies, possibly raise and maintain a little army of your own.|Engage in robot hacking ([[RIF]]) in the subsequent area.|Impair defensive capabilities in the following area. Didn't mention this one yet :D. Having created a distraction by mounting a direct attack on a garrison, the enemy will be forced to recall some combat robots, thereby shrinking the average squad size by 1. This only applies if you end up back on the same map you left, not when advancing to a new area, but it's pretty significant!|Obtain better parts, if you're lucky...|Have a chance to advance to another depth/area without searching for a normal exit in the main complex where floors might be sprawling and dangerous.|No Programmer dispatches, though you'll still have to deal with additional assault Carriers if you're causing enough trouble.|Earn bonus points for wreaking havoc.[[/List]]
[[Heading]]And the top reasons to avoid garrisons:[[/Heading]]
[[List]]Possibly very dangerous unless well-prepared! Again, this is to be expected; you're in a place where freaking everyone is packing guns, cannons, and other nasty things, quite extreme compared to most other areas of the world. It's also not exactly a huge space. There's less leeway for retreating and tactical positioning, limited sensor support, and a high probability of being ambushed.| Instead of gradually going down over time like in other floors, your security level goes up for as long as you stay inside a garrison! (Every time you see the ""ALERT: Garrison interior compromised"" announcement, your influence just rose again.)|If you're running a speed/stealth build, my guess is you'll be heading into a death trap (I'm also guessing someone will attempt to prove me wrong here...). While maps are rather small and you might think you can fly your way past everything, one wrong or unlucky move and you could start feeling the pain.|Did I mention there are quite a few [[Stasis Trap]]s?[[/List]]"
"Garrison Squad","Other","[[Image]]Garrison Squads.png|3 Garrison Squads of Sentries roaming around[[/Image]]
Garrison squads are [[0b10]] aligned [[Squad|squads]] that are dispatched whenever hostilities are reported within a 20 tile radius around a [[Garrison (Machine)]]. This can occur any time an 0b10 bot is attacked and survives to report it or if a Garrison is attacked by Cogmind or an ally. They patrol around the Garrison for about 200 turns, then return back into the Garrison. These squads only have a chance to spawn and are not guaranteed. Garrison squads can be Enumerated at a [[Terminal]].
[[Image]]Garrison Redeploying.png|A Garrison redeploying, unable to deploy squads for 34 turns[[/Image]]
[[Image]]Garrison Transmitting.png|A Garrison transmitting, soon to deploy another squad[[/Image]]
If the Garrison was activated by a nearby non-combat bot reporting an attack like a [[K-01 Serf]], a single squad will be dispatched from the Garrison, and a 100 turn cooldown will occur before the Garrison can dispatch another Garrison squad. If a combat bot reported the attack, three squads will be dispatched from the Garrison. Once is sent immediately, and two more after 100 and 200 turns. A 100 turn cooldown will occur after the third squad is dispatched. If the Garrison was damaged, one squad will be sent out immediately, with two more squads after 25 and 50 turns. A 50 turn cooldown follows in this case. The combat and non-combat bot versions of these squads can be entirely prevented by using [[Transmission Jammers]].
[[Signal Interpreters]] will indicate the timer between dispatches as a red number and the cooldown during which no squads can be dispatched as a yellow number. The Garrison will indicate that it is Transmitting when new squads are soon to arrive, and Redeploying when on cooldown. Keep in mind, the cooldown only prevents the Garrison from dispatching more Garrison squads and does not prevent other squad types like [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcements]] and [[Investigation Squad|Investigations]].
[[Heading]]Composition[[/Heading]]
If the Garrison squad was triggered by a non-combat bot reporting an attack or by the Garrison itself being attacked, the Garrison will only send out single [[Sentry|Sentries]] for the squads. If a combat bot reported an attack instead, the following squad compositions are possible:
[[List]]1 [[Brawler]] and 1 [[Duelist]]|1 [[Demolisher]], only if Cogmind has 1 or more allies|1-2 [[Grunt|Grunts]]|1-2 Sentries|2-3 [[Swarmer|Swarmers]][[/List]]"

They are by far the most populous combat bot class, being found on nearly every map and in many different squad types. Most Grunts are not especially durable or threatening on their own, though at higher depths ([[Research]] +) they can be dangerous due to their tendency to appear in large groups. Veterans and Enforcers in particular have a significant jump in firepower due to the upgrade from 1 to 2 weapons.
All Grunts share a minor weakness to Electromagnetic damage, which makes EM or Impact the best damage types to use for quick destruction via [[Corruption]]. However, without any resistances to speak of, Grunts are fairly easily dispatched by any damage type. Grunts also tend to have barely adequate cooling, which means Thermal weaponry can can easily build up heat to trigger a [[Meltdown]].
Another way to deal with Grunts is to take advantage of their low memory (20 actions). It is trivial for airborne builds to leave Grunts in the dust, but even a reasonably speedy grounded build may be able to turn a corner and outrun Grunts long enough for them to give up chase. This strategy is more effective when used with [[ECM Suites]].

Movement, firing weapons, and running power sources and some utilities generates heat, as does being hit by thermal weapons. Some of this heat is naturally dissipated by the core's own heat sinks, but not enough to deal with heat generated by numerous/large energy weapons. Heat sinks and cooling systems can be used to avoid overheating, which can have a wide range of negative effects. Heat is only a significant issue for robots that rely heavily on energy weapons. However, note that when firing a volley the heat produced is averaged over the volley's turn duration rather than being immediately applied all at once.

[[Heading]]Side Effects[[/Heading]]
Once heat reaches the ""Hot"" level (200+), active utilities and weapons may be temporarily disabled. At ""Warning"" levels (300+) power sources are likely to shut down. Many more serious (and permanent) effects are possible, especially at higher heat levels, [[B]]such as core damage[[/B]].

Disabled power sources automatically restart when possible, but other parts must be manually reactivated.

Heat effects are not calculated until after the dissipation phase, so heat can temporarily spike very high with no side effects as long as there are sufficient utilities to dissipate it.

[[Heading]]Cooling Resolution[[/Heading]]
Eventually you will discover a range of different mechanics that factor into heat management, especially with regard to cooling parts, thus knowing the specific order of operations between them may be of help for min-maxers seeking to optimize a build. Below is a list of heat-related processes that play out once per turn. Note that you most likely DO NOT need to know this stuff, but it may help answer a few specific questions min-maxers have about prioritization.

[[List:Ordered]]
Add heat from all sources, including that generated by active attached parts, gradual heat from an ongoing weapon volley, and any ambient heat. Spread combined volley heat across its duration, in other words a 3-turn volley which according to its weapon properties generates 100 heat adds 33 heat per turn until complete.|
If used the unique ""ITN"" artifact, automatically drop heat to 250 if above that value.|
Subtract innate heat dissipation.|
Subtract heat dissipation from direct cooling utilities such as Heat Sinks and Cooling Systems.|
If heat exceeds 200, apply dissipation effects of disposable cooling systems such as Coolant Injectors, up to that threshold. If more disposable systems than necessary, apply them in parts list order.|
If heat exceeds 200, apply self-damaging ablative cooling systems such as Mak. Ablative Armor. If using multiple ablative systems at once, dissipation is split into equal-sized chunks for each, where if one system fails, the entire chunk it is responsible for is still successfully dissipated.|
If heat exceeds 200, apply broad-effect ablative cooling systems such as Mak. Microdissipator Network.[[/List]]"

"Heavy","Bot Group","Heavies are a [[Bot Groups|Bot Group]] of [[Treads|treading]] [[0b10]] combat bots seen in a [[Security Squad]] guarding important intersections and exits. Heavies have a powerful 2 slot Kinetic Cannon and are supported by a variety of offensive and defensive utilities, including the [[Graphene Brace]] that blocks all forms of criticals. Heavies, much like a [[Behemoth]], will attempt to fire through walls and machines in order to attack a target. Their unique [[Active Sensor Suite]] allows them to detect hostiles within a wide radius of 20 tiles, and Heavies may summon [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcements]] when bots are detected and when attacked. They will move between different guard positions whenever a [[Security Rotation]] occurs.
[[Gallery]]Heavies.png|All Heavy variants and colors[[/Gallery]]
[[Heading]]Active Sensor Suite Reinforcements[[/Heading]]
[[Gallery]]HeavySensor.gif|Cogmind walking into detection range of a Heavy[[/Gallery]]
When Cogmind enters Active Sensor Suite range, its radius will be indicated with a yellow flash. While a bot is in this radius, the Heavy may summon reinforcements based on the speed of the bot. If a bot has the [[Active Sensor Spoofer]], the reinforcements will be redirected to a location on the opposite side of the heavy. When a bot is detected, an alert will appear in the log:
[[GameText]]ALERT: Suspicious intruders detected, dispatching specialist reinforcements to area.[[/GameText]]
Faster bots (hover/flight users) detected will typically get [[Cutter|Cutters]] summoned, while all other bots will typically get [[Specialist|Specialists]]. An airborne build may want to go temporarily overweight to reduce the chance of Cutters being summoned. However, the chance is never 100% in either direction. Bots that are actively moving within the radius are more likely to get Reinforcements called, so if a Heavy is moving as part of a security rotation, it may be better to sit still and wait for it to walk by than to continue to move around. If Cogmind has [[Encrypted Comm Array]] support, summoned Specialists may turn out to be [[Infiltrator|Infiltrators]] instead.
[[Heading]]Strategies[[/Heading]]
Heavies are quite sturdy and offensively very powerful. Though there are no damage type weaknesses, they have few weaknesses that can be taken advantage of. While Heavies have sufficient cooling to handle their own weaponry, they are unable to dissipate large amounts of additional heat. Even though the Graphene Brace prevents burn criticals, a few thermal guns with decent heat transfer are still easily capable of melting down a Heavy. A high heat transfer gun like a [[Plasma Rifle]] is a good choice for this. Another weakness of the Heavy is a high dependency on its engine to power its variety of energy-hungry utilities. If its engine is destroyed or blown off, the Heavy will quickly become unable to attack. This is most easily achieved with the [[RIF]] hacks [[GameText]]overload_power[[/GameText]] and [[GameText]]amplify_resonance[[/GameText]].
On the other hand, inferior strategies to fight Heavies are EM and melee weaponry. All Heavies have a form of [[Dynamic Insulation Systems]], and all but the Shepherd have an additional [[EM Disruption Field]] to lower EM damage. Killing via corruption is difficult, and may often take longer than killing with other types of damage. Melee attacks are all 50% resisted by a Heavy, and its cannon will knock back all but a treaded melee build.
Nearly every part on the Heavy makes for great salvage. Try to kill Heavies with salvage neutral weaponry if possible to get the great loot. Applying positive salvage with [[Salvage Targeting Computers]] is always beneficial. [[Transmission Jammers]] are very handy at preventing the additional reinforcements that come when a Heavy gets attacked. A Graphene Brace neutralizes the Blast critical from their cannons and will help protect Cogmind's fragile utilities. Heavies have a very short memory, so the best way to approach is often from a nearby room instead of running down the center of a corridor. If using a Jammer, always consider the Jammer range when approaching a Heavy for combat. Tanking a lot of additional hits to get into range is very unpleasant. If trying to escape a Heavy, the short memory may be an advantage. Once Cogmind turns a corner, the Heavy will often lose tracking before it catches back up unless it is able to shoot its way back into line of sight."

"Hub_04(d)","Location","Hub is a [[0b10]]-controlled [[Factory]] [[Branch]] that appears between -6 and -4. It is part of the [[Extension]] branch line and can only be entered through [[Archives]]. It is much more similar to normal floors than the rest of the Extension branch maps where all of the normal squad types can spawn regularly.
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
There are two types of special machines in Hub. The first, the [[Transfer Station]], is also common to Extension. When destroyed, it will reduce the number of non-combat robots on all 0b10-controlled maps by a stacking 50%. Note that this does not include [[Researcher|Researchers]].
[[Image]]Hub Explosion.gif|A Network Hub explosion[[/Image]]The other, the Network Hub, is a large EM explosive machine. When destroyed, it will reduce all machine hacking trace capabilities by 20%. Every further hub destroyed reduces by half that amount rounded down. In total, defenses are decreased by 20%, 30%, 35%, and 37%. This is equivalent to the first effect of defensive [[Hackware]]. A 20% tracing decrease is equivalent to wearing 2 base-tier [[System Shield|System Shields]]. Another effect of destroying a Network Hub is that 3 squads of 3 [[Lightning]] + 1 [[I-47 Archangel|Archangel]] will spawn from different exits and Garrisons. They will patrol around the remaining 3 Network Hubs are located. All non-combat hostiles will also be called to evacuate the map.
[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]
[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Hub_04(d)[[/Lore]]
[[Heading]]Variations[[/Heading]]There are 3 variations of the Hub map:
[[List]]Network Hubs in corners: All 4 Network Hub machines will be in their own corners of the map. They are not likely to overlap in explosion radius and cause chain reactions.|Network Hubs on left side: All 4 Network Hub machines will be on the left side of the map. It is likely that either the top 2 or bottom 2 Hub machines will overlap in explosion radius and guarantee a chain reaction. It is very rarely possible for all 4 Hubs to chain together.|Network hubs on right side: Same as above but on the right side of the map.[[/List]]
[[Heading]]Strategy[[/Heading]]
Blowing up Network Hubs as soon as you see them is usually a bad idea. Shooting them directly causes a ton of [[Alert]] gain due to their large destructive radius. The Lightning squads that follow can also be very scary for an unprepared Cogmind. If unprepared to fight off the Lightning, it is a good idea to blow up the Hubs from a distance or right next an exit.
There are a lot of methods to blow up Network Hubs that do not trigger the alert gain:
[[Heading:2]]Hostile attack[[/Heading]]
If Cogmind or an ally stands in front of a Network Hub and a 0b10 bot misses into it, the destruction will be associated with that bot and not Cogmind. This also works well with allies and drones. Just position the ally in front of a Hub and attacking enemies can shoot around or through them to trigger the explosion.
[[Heading:2]][[Traps|Trap]] explosion[[/Heading]]
Traps never assign Alert to Cogmind unless they manually trigger the trap. Any explosive or area EM traps will work, [[I]]but[[/I]] if the trap triggers due to Cogmind's corruption then the alert isn't assigned, which can be used to avoid the alert.
[[Heading:2]][[Plasma Cutter|Regular]] or [[Imp. Plasma Cutter]][[/Heading]]
Plasma Cutters can destroy any machine with minimal Alert gain. As a bonus, Plasma Cutters also do not trigger the explosion at all which can otherwise place Cogmind in a bad defensive position.
[[Heading:2]]Force(Sabotage)[[/Heading]]
If successful, this hack will blow up a random explosive machine on the map. Network Hubs are the only available targets so this will always work on this map. This hack is inconsistent and may fail multiple times in a row. This hack will cause an Alert gain of 50 if successful, but it is substantially less than the several hundred of a manually-blown Network Hub. Note: unlike this hack, Trojan(Detonate) does cause Alert to go up from the Explosion and is not a great hack to use.
[[Heading:2]]Lightning[[/Heading]]
The best way to deal with the Lightning squads is to use critical destroy weapons as they lack any critical immunity. [[8R-AWN's Boregun]], [[Adv. KE Penetrator]], and any Hyp. guns or cannons will work well. [[Damper Plating]] works great at reducing damage taken by Lightnings to negligible amounts. The [[Exp. EM Disruption Field]] that they carry can also do fine after being looted.
[[Heading]]Exits[[/Heading]]

"Hunter","Bot Group","Hunters are a [[Bot Groups|Bot Group]] of [[Legs|legged]] [[Ballistic Guns|Ballistic Gun]]-wielding [[0b10]] combat robots. They have unique AI where they use their penetrating guns to shoot through walls to get to hostiles. Hunters can also hit more accurately with their [[Targeting Computers]] and avoid hits themselves with [[Phase Shifters]]. Hunters also have an innate resistance to [[Sensor Arrays]] and will not show up without a high enough rating [[Signal Interpreter|Signal Interpreters]]. [[Squad Leader]] Hunters also have the ability to launch a [[Drone]] to pursue bots even after losing normal tracking. If the Drone spots a hostile, it will alert the owning Hunter to their position.
Mid-lategame Hunters are one of the most durable standard 0b10 combat bots due to their high evasion. Early tier Hunters are still strong, but the Terminators are a dangerous threat. Using [[Treads]] with Siege Mode or lots of Targeting of your own will help dealing with the high innate avoidance. Electromagnetic weaponry is by far the best choice to deal with Hunters, especially EM [[Launchers]] that don't have to directly hit the Hunter to deal damage. Kinetic builds may have more difficulty fighting Hunters due to their kinetic resistance, though they will appreciate the many Kinetic guns that might drop as loot
Dodging hunters is difficult to do for an airborne build. They have a much higher than average memory (60 actions), they shoot through walls, and they even release a fast-moving Drone to continue the chase. If running from a Hunter, make sure to consider the wall penetration ability because only certain angles will allow a Hunter to shoot through the wall and hit Cogmind. [[ECM Suites]] are of great use in reducing the memory to a more manageable number. Make use of [[Transmission Jammers]] when the Drone is nearby, since the jamming will prevent the Drone from alerting the Hunters of your position.

"Imprint","Other","Imprint is one of the major faction [[Alignment|alignments]] available to Cogmind in a run. It closely allies Cogmind with the [[Imprinter]] and with Zionites as a whole, with Cogmind being determined to be the Zionites' savior. Imprinting majorly changes the game, as it disables all standard [[Terminal]] hacks except for limited access Terminal hacking. Instead, there are a new set of imprint-specific hacks that are available at all Terminals. After imprinting, there is a 10 tile ""ping"" radius on all standard Terminals which will tell Cogmind their location, even through walls. However, if an [[Operator]] is nearby when this happens, the Operator will shut down the Terminal and call for [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcements]]. After about 1200-1500 turns on an [[0b10]]-controlled map, the Terminal network will be shut down with an accompanying log [[GameText]]Terminal network compromised, cutting hard line.[[/GameText]]
[[Image]]Zion Imprinting.gif|Using the imprinting machine[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]]Imprinting[[/Heading]]
Imprinting is performed on the [[Zion]] map by walking into the imprinting machine on the bottom left corner of the map. The UI will turn orange, and the 4 nearby [[Mutant (6)|Mutants]] will turn purple and follow Cogmind around.
[[Heading]]Special Terminal Hacks[[/Heading]]
There are 2 types of special Terminal hacks, roster and intel.
[[Image]]Imprint Hacks.png|A selection of special Imprint hacks[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]]Roster Hacks[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Imprint Summoning.gif|Summoning 2 Zionites with a roster hack[[/Image]]
Roster hacks summon combat allies or special [[Z-Courier]] haulers containing part resupplies. The allies and hauler contents here are depth-dependent and will grow stronger at higher depths. The hauler contents can include [[Prototype Part|Prototypes]] which can be faulty, so having some way to identify prototypes like a [[Component Analysis Suite]] is very useful before equipping. Using a roster hack will destroy the Terminal when the reinforcements are teleported in after a few turns. There are a limited number of roster hacks available on a given map, starting at 2 slots on -6, increasing every floor up to the cap of 6 slots on -2. Roster hacks will occasionally be rerolled, which can add new roster types or reroll existing types. All roster allies summoned will appear as purple uncontrollable allies which contribute to [[Alert]]. The exception is any summonable [[Z-Hero|Z-Heroes]] which appear as pink, but otherwise behave as purple allies.
One thing to keep in mind about roster rallies is that they will not attack enemies unless Cogmind is close and within line of sight. This can be both a bad and good thing. It is often bad when hostiles are hanging just around a corner and the Zionites get stuck trying to get Cogmind back in line of sight and trying to turn around the corner to fight. When stuck in this case, try to get Cogmind's line of sight over the direction the allies are trying to go. However, it may be good if Cogmind doesn't want the roster allies to stick around long and get lots of kills, racking up lots of alert. It is possible to manipulate the bots to not attack back even when they are being attacked while standing around a corner.
If Cogmind is not careful about friendly fire, roster hacks can become temporarily disabled. The length of the lockout can vary depending on the amount of friendly fire. In extreme cases, Cogmind can be locked out for the remainder of the game. Killing imprint allies directly is not recommended for this reason. Instead, it is best to try to allow allies to be killed naturally if their loot is desired
The available ally-summoning roster hacks are as follows:

[[Heading:2]]Intel hacks[[/Heading]]
Intel hacks provide Cogmind with different types of information about the current, and upcoming maps. Unlike roster hacks, intel hacks require two Terminals to use and are not instantaneous. Performing an intel hack locks the Terminal, but does not provide any information until the next Terminal is used to retrieve that intel. Retrieving intel does not lock the Terminal, however, so chaining intel retrieval with other hacks is still possible.
There are initially 4 intel hacks available per 0b10 floor. Performing intel hacks reduces the number available until there are only 2 hacks remaining. At that point, each intel hack will cause another random intel hack to become available. Unlike the fixed limit of roster hacks, intel hacks are not restricted on any given floor and are only limited by the total number of Terminals.
There are 2 categories of intel hacks: Repeatable and non-repeatable. Non-repeatable hacks can only be performed once per map. These types of hacks include map-specific intel and world map intel relating to the overall depth that certain locations occur on. Repeatable hacks can be performed an infinite number of times on any floor and tend to be longer-term types of information such as schematics and analyses. If trying to burn through intel for a specific piece of information, such as main or branch access, it is best to pick any non-repeatable hacks first. This will allow the pool of available hacks to get smaller, increasing the chances of getting the desired intel hack.
The available intel hacks are as follows:
[[Table]]Hack Name|Repatable|Effect||Active Garrisons|No|Reveals all [[Garrison (Machine)|Garrisons]] on the current map||Active Terminals|No|Reveals all Terminals on the current map||Branch Access|No|Reveals all Derelict-known [[Branch]] exits on the current map[[Sub]]1[[/Sub]]||Component Schematics|Yes|Gives 12-16 random non-Prototype [[Fabricator]] schematics||Component Stockpiles|No|Reveals locations of all non-Prototype part stockpiles on the current map||Depthwide Sectors/0|No|Reveals all Derelict-known maps on the current depth[[Sub]]1[[/Sub]]||Depthwide Sectors/-1|No|Reveals all Derelict-known maps on the next depth[[Sub]]1[[/Sub]]||Emergency Access|No|Reveals all emergency access doors on the current map||Guard Positions|No|Reveals current locations (but not types) of all [[Behemoth]], [[Heavy]], and all [[Sentry]] bots on the map||Main Access|No|Reveals all main exits on the current map||Prototype Schematics|Yes|Gives 8-12 random Prototype Fabricator schematics||Prototype Stockpiles|No|Reveals locations of all Prototype part stockpiles on the current map||Trap Installations|No|Reveals positions and types of all traps on the current map||Unaware Analyses|Yes|Gives 3 random 0b10 bot [[Robot Analysis|Analyses]]||Unaware Schematics|Yes|Gives 3 random 0b10 bot Fabricator schematics[[/Table]]

They consist of one or more [[Tracker|Trackers]] that each summon an additional [[Combat Programmer]] upon visual contact with Cogmind. Intercept squads are dispatched depending on the number of tiles moved on a map. Once Cogmind takes enough moves, a squad will always be dispatched. Intercept squads can be Enumerated at [[Terminal|Terminals]].
An alert will indicate whenever an an Intercept squad is dispatched. Additionally, the log will display a message like [[GameText]]ALERT: Reliable intel has pinpointed LRC-V3, intercept squad en route.[[/GameText]]
[[Heading]]How to get Intercepts[[/Heading]]
Intercept squads can start being sent after Cogmind if any of the following 3 scenarios occurs:
[[List]]Cogmind uses the Data Conduit in [[Data Miner (Location)]]|[[Redacted]]Cogmind gets scanned by the lasers in [[Lab]][[/Redacted]]|[[Redacted]]Cogmind gets scanned by a [[Researcher]] in [[Section 7]][[/Redacted]][[/List]]
[[Heading]]Frequency and number[[/Heading]]
Intercept squads can have a variable number of bots depending. Initially when entering a floor, Intercepts always consist of 1-2 Trackers that summon Combat Programmers. Each further intercept has a chance of increasing the number of Trackers initially dispatched.
Intercept squads can appear at one of three timings after entering the floor. The first two spawns are much more likely than the third one. Either the squad will spawn after n (depth-dependent) tiles moved 2 times n moves, or 2.5 times n moves. The following table shows the number of moves required for each spawn:
[[Table]]Depths|Tiles for first spawn|Tiles for second spawn|Tiles for third spawn||-6|500|1000|1250||-4 and -5|400|800|1000||-1 through -3|300|600|N/A[[/Table]]

"Investigation Squad","Other","[[Image]]Investigation Squad.png|Two Grunts investigating a locked out Terminal[[/Image]]
Investigation squads are [[0b10]] aligned [[Squad|squads]] that are dispatched when a hostile presence is suspected in an area. They are very similar to [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcements]], but are triggered in slightly different scenarios, and do not stick around permanently. Investigation squads typically consist of a few [[Grunt|Grunts]] or [[Hunter|Hunters]]. Grunts are more common than Hunters in squads. They roam around the area that they were summoned to for 300-400 turns, then exit the map. Investigation squads can be both Enumerated and Recalled at [[Terminal|Terminals]].
An alert will indicate whenever an Investigation squad is dispatched. Additionally, the log will display a message like [[GameText]]ALERT: Suspicious activity at Terminal F014.

"Lab","Location","Lab is a [[Factory]]/[[Research]] branch between -4 and -3 that is only accessible from [[Armory]]. This map is fixed every game, with the only variations being variations in the guaranteed items. This secret lab is used as a safe spot by the [[A bots]] to plan and coordinate as well as research stolen [[Sigix]] technology. This area has a special effect where Cogmind's [[Alert]] drops to 0 upon entering the map.
Lab has a small square entrance and a 1 tile corridor that leads to the next main access exit and a Sealed Barrier with a [[Terminal]] locking it. There are a few different ways to get inside:
[[List]]Breaking in: The main Sealed Barrier blocking the way has 80 armor and high resistances. Cutting through this is difficult without a strong overloadable thermal [[Energy Cannons|Energy Cannon]] backed with a [[Particle Chargers|Particle Charger]] or a [[Plasma Cutters|Plasma Cutter]]. Coming in this way will result in being scanned immediately.|[[Zhirov (Location)]] code: One of the Terminals at Zhirov contains an access code to open up this barrier. Opening the Lab this way not result in being scanned instantly.|Picking up the [[A7 Data Core]]: [[A7]] drops this item when destroyed. The doors will automatically open when approaching, and the message [[GameText]]A0_COM: WELCOME A7[[/GameText]] will appear in the log. This will also reveal the intruder detection lasers, but Cogmind will not be scanned immediately.|Using the [[Data Conduit]]: Using the Data Conduit in [[Data Miner (Location)]] will result in the doors opening automatically, the scanning lasers being visible, and no immediate scan.[[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]Getting Scanned[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Lab Visible Lasers.png|Visible Lab intruder detecting lasers[[/Image]]
The lasers are invisible by default, although the A7 core and using the Data Conduit will reveal them. They are 3x3 squares of yellow tiles that move randomly. Every turn there is a chance that they will move in one of the cardinal directions. The center tiles cannot overlap with other lasers and they cannot move through walls, machines, or past the entrance of the Lab. Being within the 3x3 area will result in being scanned immediately. This will cause an announcement [[GameText]]A0_COM: INTRUDER ALERT[[/GameText]] and [[A5]] will show up and fight. This scan will also cause [[Intercept Squad|Intercepts]] to appear on most [[0b10]]-controlled floors. The other way to get scanned is to break either the outer wall of Reinforced Barriers or to destroy the Active System Cloaker machine on the right side of the map. Other machines are safe to break.
The inside of the Lab contains many unique item spawns. In counter-clockwise order starting from the entrance:
[[List]]Big machine on top right: [[Core Reset Matrix]]|[[Alien Artifact]] shell on top right of map #1: [[Transdimensional Reconstructor]]|Shell #2 (middle): [[Integrated Dissipator]], [[Integrated Mediator]], or [[Integrated Reactor]]|Shell #3 (left): [[Core Expander]] or [[Core Regenerator]]|Top left item spot #1: [[Deep Network Scanner]] or [[Quantum Router]]|Item spot #2: [[AEGIS Remote Shield]], [[Exp. Powered Armor]], [[Hvy. Regenerative Plating]], or [[Med. Regenerative Plating]]|Item spots #3/4: [[Hyp. EM Gauss Rifle]], [[Potential Cannon]], [[Tachyon Dispersion Ray]], or [[Warp Cannon]]|Item tucked into bottom right wall: [[Gui. Remote Datajack]][[/List]]
There is also a locked chamber at the bottom of the map. Accessing it requires walking through a scan laser positioned in the bottom left corner of the lab. The Blast Barrier that locks the door has 45 armor and no Thermal resistance, but 50% resistance for most other major damage types. Inside is a machine that contains the [[LC Capacitor]].
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
Not counting the entrance Terminal, there are 3 unique interactive Terminals on this map. They will only be understandable if the Data Conduit has been used this run, otherwise they will just be garbled text. The Active System Cloaker machine on the right has some lore records and will summon a squad of [[Grunt|Grunts]] when destroyed. The A0 Command machine on the left only has lore records. Some of these records can only be unlocked if certain gameplay actions were performed this game. The hidden Storage 04-B machine has some lore records explaining the LC Capacitor and has a hack that will drop the Capacitor on the ground where it can be used.
[[Heading]]Unlockable Lab Orders[[/Heading]]
While most of the Lab Orders in the A0 Command machine are available all of the time, there are a few that have special conditions to achieve:
[[List]]Order 6-0321: Destroy the [[Cetus]] Manufacturing Module machine|Order 6-0323: [[Warlord]] must be destroyed in his [[Warlord (Location)|base]]. Cogmind does not need to be the one to destroy Warlord or attack him at all.|Order 6-0324: Warlord must be met in his base, survive, and plan to attack -2 [[Research]][[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]L2 Power Cell code[[/Heading]]
Order 6-0319 will provide a manual Terminal hack that can be used in [[Section 7]] on the Power Cell Monitoring machine. Using it will create a powerful explosion that will destroy any combat bots in its 20 tile range."

"Latent Energy Streamer","Part","The Latent Energy Streamer uses a unique mechanic called latent energy to fire. At maximum latent energy capacity (100), the true damage potential is 90-100, with 1% disruption and +4 salvage.
[[Heading]]Latent Energy[[/Heading]]
Latent Energy is present all around the map but only in generally small quantities. The most latent energy is present in the various machinery. This means that the Streamer tends to be unimpressive in [[Caves]], but much stronger in [[0b10]]-controlled locations. Each type of machine has a different amount of latent energy it can provide to the Streamer. Generally, larger machines provide more latent energy. Attaching the Latent Energy Streamer allows visualization of how much latent energy is in an area.
[[Image]]Latent Energy Visualized.png|Latent energy visualized[[/Image]]
Latent energy will gradually return to an area after being used to power the Streamer. Generally, all latent energy will be restored within about 30 turns. Some explosive machines will either become destabilized or explode instantly when used to power the Streamer. Any resulting destruction will contribute to Cogmind's [[Alert]] level."

"Locations","Other","Locations in Cogmind are unique styles of maps to visit. The main floors (Scrapyard, Materials, Factory, Research, and Access) are always located on the same depths every run. These main floors often can be visited in multiple depths. Branches, on the other hand, are typically found on only a single depth per-run and are often mutually exclusive with other branches. For example, Mines can always be found on -9, but Storage may also appear on -9, forcing a decision about which branch to take, or whether to take one at all.
The majority of maps are randomly generated, meaning no two runs or two depths will have the exact same layout. However, the overall structure of each location type is very similar. Some maps tend to be more open with large rooms and wide corridors, while others are more maze-like with tiny rooms and many small corridors leading into dead-ends. A few branches are partially or entirely static in layout and tend to be much more predictable in contents than main floors.
Branches do not progress upward toward the exit and can often be harder than the main floors. However, branches can offer unique challenges and have similarly unique rewards that can dramatically change a run. This could be powerful unique items, special events, gameplay-altering alignment, or rare permanent buffs.

They are slightly slower than regular [[Thief|Thieves]]. When appearing near an exit, some nearby Caves prefabs that normally have robots, such as 0b10 outposts may end up empty.


[[Heading:2]]Behavior[[/Heading]]
Master Thieves dash towards Cogmind to try to steal one of their parts using [[Master Tearclaws]], prioritizing high rating parts and [[Exiles (Location)|Exiles]] prototypes. Upon success, they will start fleeing. If a fleeing Master Thief goes outside Cogmind's field of view, they will exit the map.

Unlike regular Thieves, Master Thieves will only attack Cogmind, and will ignore all other robots.

[[Heading:2]]Strategies[[/Heading]]
Master Thieves are incapable of taking parts on the ground, so dropping important parts you don't want to lose keeps them safe from them. Dropping your [[Storage Unit]] can help drop a lot of parts quickly, at the cost of not being able to choose which parts remain in inventory. However, this strategy can backfire if there are [[Dirty Bomb Trap|Dirty Bomb Traps]] or [[Decomposer|Decomposer]] nearby, or if Cogmind or other robots carry  [[Launchers]] or [[Electromagnetic Weapons]] capable of triggering chain reactions in power sources.

In order to actually destroy Master Thieves, Launchers can work well when aimed at walls next to them, though at close range the collateral damage might not be worth it if you don't have high-value parts. Targeting utilities can help actually hit them while they are approaching, and a Stasis Beam/Projector can prevent a single Master Thief from attacking or escaping while also making them easier to hit, at the cost of making them take 50% less damage.

If Cogmind is fast enough, fleeing is also an option, for example to lead the Master Thieves into 0b10 robots, [[Warlord]]-aligned derelicts or traps.

"Materials","Location","Materials is the first real level of the game. These maps are small, cramped and have few paths forward. This is the first map with hostile [[0b10]] patrols hanging around, comprised mainly of low level [[G-34 Mercenary]] and [[G-47 Trooper]] grunts and [[S-10 Pest]] swarmers. There are also a few special special mechanics such as [[U-05 Engineer|Engineers]] not calling for reinforcements when attacked while trying to build structures in -10 and -9 and [[A-02 Transporter|Haulers]] not calling for reinforcements at all.
Trying to play flight or hover is not easy in Materials due to many forced encounters with combat robots, little room for maneuvering and few slots yet available for good utilities. The usual recommended way to play these maps is to grab some legs or treads and start blasting. Most players prefer not to transfer to airborne propulsion until [[Factory]] where it is much easier to stealth around and avoid combat. In Materials, it's good to fight enemies one at a time by leading them to one of the many doorways around the map. Use of launchers is very effective whenever there is more than a single bot grouped up close.
[[Alert]] is not a big issue in these maps because of the relatively small map size and number of total patrols. If making a mess of the floors on -10 and -9, entering the [[Mines]] is a good way to lose all of the alert gained from the early Materials maps.
Full list of depth-specific mechanics that apply in Materials:

Storage Unit|Small]], [[Med. Storage Unit|Medium]], and [[Lrg. Storage Unit|Large]] storage units[[/Gallery]]The storage cache prefab can be very important early on in the game. Cogmind only starts with a [[Sml. Storage Unit]] with very little room for important backup parts and should upgrade ASAP. While not guaranteed, these storage caches will appear on almost every Materials map. [[Hcp. Storage Unit]] and [[Huge Storage Unit]] can both be commonly found on the floor in these maps, but they are not included in the standard storage cache prefab.
The other important cache is the out-of-depth parts cache. These caches contain 3 groups of 4 parts that will be one rating out of depth and can include prototypes. For example, on -9 Materials the standard highest rating part is a 2, while the cache will contain rating 3 or 3* [[Prototype Part|Prototype Parts]]. This is one of the best ways to become very strong in Materials. For example, getting a stockpile of [[Enh. Autogun|Enh. Autoguns]] on -9 can help set a combat up for multiple floors to come.[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]There are 3 types of normal exits in Materials:[[List]]Main access exits: These always lead to the next main floor, either Materials or [[Factory]]. These exits can be recognized by their distinctive 3 tile corridor leading to a dead-end exit along the edges of the map. There are always 3 of these per Materials map.|[[Mines]] exits: These exits are almost always distinguishable by a few specific prefabs of some machinery and a cache of items. Occasionally Mines exits will spawn without the prefab and look like standard exits. There are either 1 or 2 Mines exits on -10 and -9.|[[Storage]] exits: These exits do not have a prefab at all and look like standard exits. There is often a [[Y-45 Defender|Sentry]] guarding these exits, but it is not guaranteed. Storage only spawns on 1 depth between -9 and -7 and 1-2 exits can be found to Storage on that map.|[[Subcaves]] exits: Hidden behind a large area of diggable dirt where a new room is planned.

"Mechanic","Bot Group","Mechanics are [[Wheel|wheeling]] [[0b10]] non-combat bots that repair the parts and core of damaged allies. They tend to hang around a home [[Repair Station]]. Mechanics will head toward damaged allies as soon as they are hurt but will not repair them while in combat. Mechanics carry [[Recalibrators]] and [[Machine Analyzer|Machine Analyzers]] that can be good to salvage. They also carry a set of backup parts in their inventory based on the bot tier. These backup parts will be refitted on bots if they have empty slots.
If a hurt bot is not shot at for a few turns, the Mechanic will repair core integrity up to 85% and part integrity up to 50%. Allied Mechanics will also repair Cogmind's parts up to 50% integrity but will not touch core integrity. Blue allied Mechanics must be set to Aid before they will repair integrity.
Mechanics can refit parts if a bot has a slot available and fewer than 2 power, propulsion, utility, or weapon slots. 0b10 aligned Mechanics can resupply on backup parts at their home Repair Station. The available refittable parts are based on the type of Mechanic:

"Mechanics Achievements","Other","Mechanics [[Achievements]] are earned by interacting with and/or using many of the mechanics of the game. They are largely used as a way to teach players about some of said mechanics. Most of them will be simply eventually be obtained by players as they make mistakes and/or learn new mechanics. 15 of the 72 Mechanics Achievements have hidden descriptions that are only revealed after completing them. The borders of Mechanics Achievement indicate their difficulty compared to other achievements of the same sub-type, with more ""intense"" borders meaning higher difficulty.

[[Comment]]I don't know how to best categorize ""Various""-type achievements.
They're still somewhat grouped, like ""Part-time Excavator"" and ""Unlikely Earthworm"", but making a heading for just two achievements seems like a bit much.

[[Heading]]Various[[/Heading]]
[[List]]Close Call: [[Spoiler]]Evolve after being reduced to less than 10% of core integrity.[[/Spoiler]]
|Universal Adapter: [[Spoiler]]Use every form of propulsion across an entire run.[[/Spoiler]]
|Hehehe: Reprogram a [[Traps|trap]] using a [[Datajack]].
Strategy: Find some hostile Traps, attach a melee Datajack, and attempt to move into one of the Traps with the Datajack active. This won't actually cause you to move onto them, and will instead attempt to hack the Trap. On a successful attempt, the Trap will either be disarmed or reprogrammed. Only the latter will trigger the Achievement.
|Wheee!: Manually trigger a [[Chute Trap]].
Strategy: Find some Chute Traps in [[Factory]] either through luck or by using the [[GameText]]find_chute[[/GameText]] [[Datajacks|Datajack]] hack on a [[K-01 Serf]]. Note that the Achievement requires [[I]]manually[[/I]] triggering the Chute Trap, which means pressing '>' while on top of a known Chute Trap (or left-click on self) to force it to trigger. Triggering a Chute Trap by moving into a known one is not enough. If possible, reprogram the Traps using a melee Datajack or a nearby Terminal. When using [[Treads]] or while overweight, the Chute Traps will need to have been reprogrammed, as it is otherwise impossible to move onto them without triggering them.

Strategy: Find and trigger a Stasis Trap, preferably while using non-[[Treads|threaded]] propulsion, then blow up the Trap with a [[Launchers|Launcher]] or nearby explosive machine. Note that the Achievement will only be unlocked if the Trap itself is destroyed; If the stasis field gets depleted by the explosion first, the Trap will disappear, preventing it from being destroyed by the explosion. This Achievement is there to teach players that destroying a Stasis Trap causes the stasis field to disappear. Getting rid of a stasis field this way is rarely a good idea, but in some situations, taking a bit of damage to avoid getting spotted by powerful hostiles may be run-saving.

The 3 different types of Derelict shop events are all great events to get. The out-of-depth parts will usually provide an immediate buff and the early [[Imp. Trap Extractor]] can be very strong for anybody who wants to use a lot of [[Traps]].

There are a mix of friendly and hostile events that can occur in the Mines. While the friendly events can be very nice, some of the bad ones can easily be run-ending.

Using a digging tool like a [[Mining Laser]] or [[Mining Claw]] is recommended to escape quicker.|(--) Assembled invasion: A large number of Assembled will appear and start attacking everything nearby. An [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] containing 2 [[D-53 Grenadier|Demolishers]] will be dispatched from the closest Materials exit and sent to the initial spawn location. A [[Guerrilla (5)|Derelict]] will appear next to you and tell you to run away as they provide a distraction. This event is extremely dangerous so early in the game as both the Assembled and Demolishers can deal a lot of damage very quickly. A launcher is highly recommended for dealing with the Assembled, while strong single-target weapons like kinetic cannons are ideal for dealing with the Demolishers. Getting stuck between them both is the worst case scenario and stripping to core and running is sometimes the only option to survive. A good tactic to avoid combat is to try to dig into the walls using a digging tool like a [[Mining Laser]] or [[Mining Claw]] and hide out of sight for a few hundred turns. Usually, most of the Assembled and Demolishers end up destroying each other.[[/List]]"

[[Image]]NEM.gif|Effect of the Navigation Efficiency Matrix[[/Image]]
[[Heading]]Teleport effects[[/Heading]]
An NEM teleport behaves similarly to a standard [[Transdimensional Reconstructor]] effect. All bots that are tracking Cogmind will instantly lose tracking, even including perfect tracking mechanics like [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]] use. However, unlike a standard teleport, the NEM can teleport Cogmind through solid walls. This can sometimes be useful for escaping squads as it will place Cogmind out of sight in a different room. One downside of this effect is that teleporting can repeatedly trigger the [[Watcher]] [[Alert]] increase on sight, as it will forget Cogmind each time the teleport occurs.
[[Heading:2]]Frequency[[/Heading]]
There are 2 ""timers"" that can activate an NEM teleport. One is based on tiles moved, and the other is based on non-moving actions.
The non-moving actions timer will count up whenever Cogmind performs any action other than moving. This includes waiting in place, so it is not possible to avoid teleports altogether. The non-moving action timer will trigger every 36-48 actions.
The moving actions timer will count up for every move Cogmind makes. This timer is much shorter, and will occur 20-32 tiles moved.
[[Heading:2]]Distance[[/Heading]]
A single NEM teleport will move Cogmind anywhere between 8-12 tiles from the original location. If a [[Subatomic Replicator]] is used on the NEM and two are consumed, this effect doubles to 16-24 tiles moved."

[[Spoiler]]The same effect occurs if an [[Imprint|imprinted]] Cogmind pings a Terminal and the Operator is nearby.[[/Spoiler]] As such, Operators should ideally be avoided or prevented from summoning reinforcements in some way. Operators are good looting sources of [[Datajacks]], both offensive and defensive [[Hackware]] as well as [[System Restoration Modules]]. When destroyed, they drop a [[Data Core]] that provides a one time hacking bonus and reveals nearby traps.
Operators make good allies due to their unique ability to increase Cogmind's hacking power and detect [[Traps]]. Operators within a range of 20 tiles will contribute a 10% (then 5%, 2%, and 1%) stacking offensive hacking bonus per Operator. Additionally, allied Operators will report all trap locations that Cogmind encounters in visual range as long as the Operator is within a 20 tile radius.

"Overload","Other","Overloading is a [[Game Mechanics|Game Mechanic]] available on primarily Cld. parts that allows for a temporary increase in effectiveness with additional heat costs and potential downsides based on the stability of the part. It is possible to perform for Power, Propulsion, and Weapon type items.
[[Heading]]Power[[/Heading]]
Some power parts (e.g. [[Cld. Ion Engine]]) support overloading. Overloading power causes the following changes:
[[List]]Doubled energy generation|Doubled heat generation|Chance to shut down for ~5-10 turns and be damaged ~30-40% of the maximum integrity, based on the Stability % stat[[/List]]
[[Heading]]Propulsion[[/Heading]]

[[List]]Doubled energy cost|Tripled heat generation|50% additional support|Speed is calculated as if there are twice the number of active Flight/Hover units (e.g. an overloaded Cld. VTOL Module will gain an additional -3 speed modifier)|Overload propulsion has a chance to suffer 1 point of damage each move that the part is active or each melee attack, based on the Burnout % stat[[/List]]
One special case, the [[Potential Leg]], does not have any of the above effects except for the burnout damage. Overloaded Potential Legs instead have their base speed halved.

Patrol squads are typically [[0b10]] aligned [[Squad|squads]] that patrol between points on the majority of 0b10-controlled maps, as well as [[Caves]]. They can be composed of a variety of bot types, all with slightly different patrolling behavior. Most patrol squads appear at the start of the map and will not appear over time, with the exception of [[Search Patrol|Search Patrols]]. Their presence is generally unrelated to [[Alert]]. Patrols can be Enumerated at [[Terminal|Terminals]]. Their frequency varies based on the type of map, but generally they are more common the higher up in the complex Cogmind goes.

[[Heading]]Patrol behavior[[/Heading]]
There are essentially 2 types of patrol behaviors. ARC and Hunter squads are fast patrollers, which navigate between their patrol points at max or near max speed. They quickly move in and out of areas so they can be hard to avoid if in the way, but are easier to navigate around without waiting long periods of time. Grunts, Programmers, and Swarmer squads all patrol much slower. They meander along the way and spend far more turns resting than moving forward along their route. It is easier to run away form these types of patrols if you know they are coming, but they can clog rooms or hallways for long periods of time.

[[Heading]]Special patrol-summoning events[[/Heading]]
There are a few special events that can trigger patrol dispatches when already on a level.
[[Heading:2]][[Search Patrol|Search Patrols]][[/Heading]]
Search Patrols are a special type of patrol that is related to Alert. These squads can be dispatched if Cogmind generates a lot of non-combat Alert. They consist of a single [[C-30 ARC]] that roam across the entire map instead of just between two points like most patrols.
[[Spoiler]][[Heading:2]][[Lightning]] squads[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Lightning Squad.png|A Lightning squad patrolling Quarantine[[/Image]]
Lightning squads consist of 3 Lightnings and an [[I-47 Archangel]]. They can be summoned in one of two ways:

"Programmer","Bot Group","Programmers are a [[Bot Groups|Bot Group]] of [[Hover Units|hovering]] [[0b10]] combat bots armed with EM weaponry and a [[Datajacks|Remote Datajack]]. Programmers will attempt to corrupt and hack any hostiles, potentially changing alliances by assimilating them. They can also remove system corruption from their allies and clear certain [[RIF]] hacks from allied bots. They are a persistent threat throughout [[Factory]] and beyond due to being sent as part of [[Extermination Squad|Extermination Squads]].
Programmers are best fought with kinetic or thermal weaponry due to their slight weakness to them. Many cannons are able to kill a Programmer with only one core shot. These weapons are ideal to use. For thermal weaponry, they are also fairly susceptible to heat transfer triggering side effects and an early meltdown. Their EM resistance coupled with their tendency to travel in packs make EM and Impact poor choices to fight them, as corruption death is unlikely.
Programmers are not initially very threatening bots. They deal small amounts of EM damage and appear only in small groups in [[Factory]] depths. However, in [[Research]] they turn into a frequent threat, appearing in larger groups and dealing significant EM damage inflicting consistent corruption to Cogmind. Having a good weapon that kill Programmers in a single core hit is ideal. For airborne builds, being able to outrun or recall Exterminations is a good strategy. Keep in mind that they are fairly fast for combat bots and have a high memory of 80. [[ECM Suites]] are very helpful for shaking Programmers more easily on the run.

[[Heading]]Lore collection progress[[/Heading]]
The lore collection contains all lore records, dialogues and their source, as well as all analyses and the general robot type they are about. All start out hidden, and are revealed in the collection when found within the game world.
[[List]]
Records - There are two types of lore records : [[0b10]] database records, which can be access on any 0b10 [[Terminal]] with proper database authorization, and all other lore records, which will only ever appear in one prefab, on one specific Terminal. There are also a few records that are not part of the lore collection, mostly non-unique records from [[Caves|Cave]] outposts that contain Terminals.|
Dialogues - The only dialogues that matter for the lore collection are textbox dialogues. Dialogue lines that only appear in the log and at the bottom of the screen with no textbox (like [[Operator|Operators]]' IFF handshake text) do not count towards the lore collection.|
Analyses - There are three types of analyses : ""Common"" for common 0b10 bots, ""Derelict"" for non-0b10 bots, and ""Prototype"" for prototype 0b10 bots. Mechanically speaking, there are many to obtain analyses, but the only way to get them in the lore collection is to hack them on Terminals.
[[/List]]
The lore collection orders its contents first by type, then by alphabetical order. However, when viewing the lore collection in-game, it is possible to export it as a txt, html or csv file. The resulting file orders its contents differently : Type first, then source (or robot type for analyses), then by alphabetical order. Except for csv files, this includes undiscovered records, making it possible to view how many records and dialogues remain to be found from certain sources. Note that if no records/dialogues have been found from one source, then the undiscovered records/dialogues from that source will not be included within the exported file.
The relevant scoresheet statistic is ""Lore%"".

It can be obtained by either using a [[Subatomic Replicator]] on a Companion Sword or by using the Companion Sword for while. The Quantum Companion has all of the special effects that the base Companion Sword has with a higher frequency of occurrence and also has some new unique effects of its own.
[[Heading]]Special Effects[[/Heading]]
[[Table]]Effect|Description|Frequency||Materialization|The Quantum Companion will materialize in one of Cogmind's weapon slots within a few turns of being detached. If no slots are available, the weapon in the first slot will be detached to make room. Occurs even if the Quantum Companion is destroyed, in which case it will reappear with full integrity. The log message [[GameText]]Quantum Companion materializes via a weapon slot.[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens.|Always||Sensors|After some time in Quantum Companion form, the Quantum Companion will develop 12 range bot detection. Unlike typical sensors, these work on all bots without a [[Signal Interpreter]], even if they have the Scan Cloak trait.|Always||Surprise Attack|The Quantum Companion will ""surprise attack"" one additional target on a normal attack. The log message [[GameText]]Quantum Companion surprise attacks [target].[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens.|Common||Core Loss|The Companion Sword deals between 5-10 core damage directly to Cogmind's core on a normal attack. Can't be reduced by [[Core Shieldings]] or [[Shield Generators/Force Fields]]. Only happens when Cogmind attacks something with the Companion Sword.|Uncommon||Shadow Attack|A shadow clone of the sword attacks a hostile bot at range. Can occur even when not attacking. This attack cannot miss. The log message [[GameText]]Quantum Companion releases a shadow of itself that zips off toward [target].[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens. This attack deals 70-100 phasic damage.|Uncommon||Bot Disruption|A bot is instantly disrupted on a normal attack. As with normal disruption, a disrupted bot can be rewired as long as it isn't hacking immune. The log message [[GameText]][target] shuts down.[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens.|Rare||Redirected Attack|When attacked by a projectile, the Quantum Companion will redirect the attack back to the attacker. The log message [[GameText]]Redirected attack with Quantum Companion.[[/GameText]] will appear with this happens. 200 energy required for this effect.|Rare||Sever|A part is severed off of a bot on a normal attack. This effect can hit through the Dismemberment immunity, unlike standard Sever critical hits.|Rare||Sunder|This effect will instantly sunder a bot, similar to the [[Core Stripper]] on a normal attack. All parts are dropped between 1/3 and 2/3 integrity. Affected by the Dismemberment immunity. The log message [[GameText]][target] is sundered.[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens.|Rare||Surge of Energy|This effect instantly kills a bot on a normal attack. The log message [[GameText]][target] is pierced by a surge of energy.[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens.|Rare||Teleport|Cogmind is instantly teleported next to a hostile bot at no time cost. Can be used to trigger an instant sneak attack if the bot hasn't spotted Cogmind yet. Can happen at any point in time. The log message [[GameText]]The surroundings shift and blur.[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens. 25 energy required for this effect.|Rare[[/Table]]
[[Heading]]Transformation[[/Heading]]
If a Subatomic Replicator is used on the Quantum Companion, it will transform into the [[Superquantum Companion]]. Unlike the base Companion Sword, this effect does not occur from use alone. This means that it is not possible to use a replicator to get from the base Companion Sword and also get the Quantum Companion. When this happens, the following game log message will appear: [[GameText]]Quantum Companion blips out of existence for a moment, then partially fades back in.[[/GameText]] The Superquantum Companion will also comment: [[GameText]]As you get more powerful, it's only fair that I, too, become godlike![[/GameText]]"

"Quarantine","Location","Quarantine is a [[0b10]]-controlled [[Branch]] off of [[Research]] that appears on either -3 or -2. It is always on the floor that [[Testing]] is not on. Quarantine is a much smaller and generally more manageable map compared to normal Research floors. There are few patrols, no [[Sentry]] or [[Heavy]] guards, and only a few special mini guard areas that can usually be easily avoided. There are unique [[Researcher]] bots that show up on this map that have dangerous effects when getting scanned. Quarantine is home to a large number of unique [[Alien Artifact|Alien Artifacts]] that can be strong equippable parts or consumable effects not found elsewhere. Unlike most maps, the ambient temperature in Quarantine is -20 rather than 0. This has the effect of giving an additional 20 heat dissipation per turn to all bots on the map. Like all Research branches, [[Farcom]] will trigger [[Maximum Security]] upon entry.
Testing is home to the [[Sigix Containment Pod]], a captured [[Sigix]] warrior being trapped in a cage. Carrying the Sigix to the [[Surface]] is required to achieve a W3 [[Wintypes]]. The Sigix always spawns in the vertically opposite corner of the map that Cogmind first spawns on. For example, if Cogmind would spawn in the top-left section of the map, the Sigix would be in the bottom left. The Sigix is locked behind a [[Terminal]] and some Sealed Heavy Doors with 40 armor. After opening or digging past the doors, the Sigix will have some garbled dialogue unless Cogmind has used a [[Core Reset Matrix]] first. There will be a lockdown [[Patrol Squad|patrol squad]] dispatched consisting of an [[I-47 Archangel]] and 3 [[Lightning|Lightnings]] at this point. They do not have active tracking on Cogmind but simply patrol around the area. Behind the doors, one Terminal contains the access code needed to be used on the other Terminal to open the 80 armor Sigix Quarantine Chamber.
[[Heading:2]]Getting Scanned[[/Heading]]
Attacking when in visual range of a Researcher or attacking a Researcher will result in them turning yellow and attempting to stasis and scan any hostiles. Whenever any bot is caught in stasis, the Researcher will summon a [[Reinforcement Squad]] to its current position. If Cogmind is scanned, it will also result in [[Q-Series]] being summoned instead of [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]]. These Q-Series have custom loadout that depends on Cogmind's current build.
Typically getting scanned is seen as a negative due to the high power level of Q-Series. Some builds might intentionally want to get scanned in order to get the Q-Series loot. To avoid unintentionally scanning, detach any ranged weapons whenever a Researcher is in line of sight of Cogmind. Melee weapons, special weapons like [[Datajacks]], and any type of guided weapon are safe to keep equipped to avoid misfires due to [[Corruption]].
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
There is one special type of machine in Quarantine called the Cryocooling Duct. There is usually at least one of these on every Quarantine floor. The map is affected by how many ducts are destroyed:
[[List]]0: The ambient temperature of the map is -20|1: The ambient temperature of the map rises to 0. All noncombat (green) bots are called to evacuate map and will head toward the nearest exit. This does [[Researcher|Researchers]] and green [[Operator|Operators]] that have already spotted Cogmind, but yellow Operators and [[Watcher|Watchers]] will not exit the map.|2: The ambient temperature becomes +20 which will apply 20 heat to all bots on the map every turn. All combat hostiles will be called to evacuate the map and most forms of squad dispatches will stop happening, including [[Assault Squad|Assaults]] and [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]]. After about 100 turns, 12 [[Quarantine Guard|Quarantine Guards]] will be dispatched to the map. Some will patrol around the map looking for hostiles, while others will guard key spots like exits and the [[Garrison (Machine)|Garrison]] (if any are present).|3+: Ambient heat continues to rise +20 per destroyed machine, but no other special effects occur.[[/List]]

This map can only happen after Quarantine, but is not necessarily on the same floor. A large 4 tile doorway will show up on the middle of the map, on the right side of where the map typically ends. It will open up into a 6 tile hallway and a [[Fortress]] will be guarding the path to the exit.[[/Redacted]][[/List]]"

While they are equipped with [[Tractor Beams]] and [[Field Recycling Units]], Recyclers do not actually make use of these parts. Recyclers are a major nuisance for their ability to steal loot before Cogmind can pick it up. If Recyclers are closing in, fire a single shot at them to get them to run away for a while and leave your loot alone. They have the highest salvage potential of any 0b10 non-combat bot, so killing them is a great way to restock on matter."
"Recycling","Location","Recycling is an early game [[0b10]]-controlled [[Branch]] with few active combat hostiles. The 3 ways to enter this branch are by using the [[GameText]]\\IAMDERELICT[[/GameText]] code at the Recycling exit in [[Storage]], by entering a Storage [[Garrison (Machine)|Garrisons]] and looping back into this floor instead of proceeding to the next depth, or by taking the guarded exit in [[Subcaves]]. There are a few dormant [[Sentry|Sentries]] guarding hallways and several more in rooms with large amounts of rewirable bots. Unlike most 0b10 maps, more combat bots will not be summoned in any scenario. Recycling is unique in that it forces a skipped depth. For example, entering a Storage map on -8 leads to a Recycling map on -8 that leads to a [[Factory]] map on -6 rather than -7 like most branches.
The main benefits to going to Recycling are for [[Scraptown]] or obtaining the unique [[Scrap Engine]] from the scraplab. Because there are no combat reinforcements of any kind, there are few downsides to getting traced at all of the [[Terminal|Terminals]] and [[Recycling Machine|Recycling Machines]] aside from minor [[Alert]] gain. There are a large number of Recycling Machines on this map and using [[GameText]]Force(Tunnel)[[/GameText]] on all of them can be very helpful in uncovering the depths of many maps in the floors above. There are commonly a large number of [[Corrupted Parts|corrupted]] [[Authchips]] available for players who want to do a lot of [[Fabricator|Fabrication]]. A small army can be raised off of the rewirable bots in some of the rooms, though tend to be heavily damaged.

[[Heading:2]]Scraplab[[/Heading]]
Cogmind can gain access to the Scraplab by entering a particular dead end-seeming rectangular room. Inside are Terminals providing information on the [[Scrap Engine]] and a way to eject the Scrap Engine. Beware that releasing the Scrap Engine will count as a hostile action and cause the Scraptown exit to close and all inhabitants of the Scraplab to become hostile. One additional [[Scrapper]] will appear from the exit to attack Cogmind when this happens.
[[Heading:3]][[SUBCON Basin]] delivery[[/Heading]]
If the full SUBCON basin is delivered from Subcaves and dropped on the ground, one of the [[Scientist|Scientists]] will drop a [[Tech Extrapolator]] on the ground. This is the only way to obtain one without attacking Scraptown, as the Extrapolators attached to the scientists in the lab will explode after death.
[[Heading:2]][[01-MTF]][[/Heading]]
If 01-MTF is brought from Storage to the Scraplab, a special event will occur. 01-MTF will try to explain something to [[KN-7UR]], but KN-7UR will say that his time is up, and they will begin to fight. Cogmind may choose to help out in the fight. If Cogmind attacks KN-7UR and 01-MTF wins the fight, 01-MTF will drop a 99 charge [[Relay Coupler [Proto]]]. If Cogmind attacks 01-MTF and KN-7UR wins, KN-7UR will drop their [[KN-7UR's Autopenetrator]].
[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There are two types of exit in Recycling:
[[List]]Main access exit: This will always lead to the [[Factory]] map that is 2 floors above the current depth.|Scraptown exit: The exit through the Scraplab will always lead to Scraptown on the same depth.[[/List]]
[[Image]]Recycling Warlord Attack.png|Derelicts attacking Recycling[[/Image]]
[[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]
There is a rare Recycling event where the floor is stormed by white colored friendly but uncontrollable [[Warlord]]-aligned Derelicts. They will beeline toward the exit, stopping only to shoot any hostiles they encounter. On exiting the floor, a few squads of the Warlord bots will also spawn on the next map and roam around."
"Recycling Machine","Other",""
"Reflective Plating","Part",""
"Reinforced Walls","Other","Many areas are sealed off by various types of Reinforced Walls. These walls all have much higher than typical armor values and resistances to most common damage types. The common theme between them all is that they do not have any Thermal resistance. As such, Cld. thermal [[Energy Cannons]] are the ideal way to cut through many of these barriers. Unlike basic walls, reinforced walls will not collapse due to penetrating weapons.
There are two primary types of reinforced walls. Though they have different names, they behave functionally similarly. Orange doors block the main access to the blocked off area. These doors have a higher than normal armor value, but they tend to be lower than reinforced barriers. Reinforced barriers typically surround the remainder of the area to prevent digging in from the back side. In most maps, these have two times the normal armor level of walls. For example, an average Storage wall has an armor value of 24, so the reinforced barriers have an armor value of 48 on this map.

"Reinforcement Squad","Other","[[Image]]Reinforcement Squad.png|2 Hunters in a reinforcement squad[[/Image]]
Reinforcement squads are [[0b10]] aligned [[Squad|squads]] that are dispatched when a hostile presence is reported in an area. They are similar to [[Investigation Squad|Investigations]], but are triggered in slightly different scenarios, and typically stick around permanently. Reinforcement squads typically consist of a few [[Grunt|Grunts]] or [[Hunter|Hunters]]. [[Heavy|Heavies]] can call unique types of reinforcements that do not stick around forever and are made up of [[Cutter|Cutters]] or [[Specialist|Specialists]]. Reinforcements will roam around the area that they were summoned to permanently. They can be both Enumerated and Recalled at [[Terminal|Terminals]].
An alert will indicate whenever a Reinforcement squad is dispatched. Additionally, the log will display a message like [[GameText]]ALERT: Hostiles spotted, dispatching reinforcements to Terminal F003.[[/GameText]] Depending on the method triggering the reinforcement, a different reason my be given in the alert.

[[Heading]]Heavy reinforcements[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Heavy Reinforcement Squad.png|A Heavy and summoned Specialist reinforcements[[/Image]]
Heavy-summoned reinforcements behave differently than other reinforcements. These reinforcements only stick around for about 150 turns before returning back to a nearby exit as opposed to staying permanently. Heavy reinforcement contents also depend on Cogmind's speed. If Cogmind is on a fast airborne propulsion type like hover or flight, Cutters will be dispatched far more frequently than Specialists. For all slower grounded propulsion types, Specialists are the most common summon type.
Heavy reinforcements are called more frequently if Cogmind is actively moving. If trying to avoid reinforcements, Cogmind should quickly exit the Heavy's sensor radius rather than spend turns moving inside the radius. If the Heavy is on a [[Security Rotation]] and currently moving, it may be a good idea to stand still until the Heavy has moved away to try to avoid reinforcements rather than to continue moving in detection range.

"Relay Interface Framework","Other","[[Image]]Garrison RIF Installer 1.png|RIF Installer in a Garrison[[/Image]]
Relay Interface Framework, or RIF, is one of the major [[Alignment|alignments]] available to Cogmind in a run. It helps Cogmind to have much more control over [[0b10]] bots, both combat and non-combat. RIF comes with the downside of alienating several key [[Derelict]] factions, namely turning all Derelicts at [[Zion]] and [[Warlord (Location)]] hostile when passing their associated System Quarantine Field Array machines. RIF is also incompatible with the [[Core Reset Matrix]]. If Cogmind has used a CRM then it is not possible to gain RIF. If Cogmind uses a CRM after using RIF, then RIF will be entirely erased. Similarly, if Cogmind has [[Imprint|imprinted]], then the RIF will fail to be installed.

"Research","Location","Research is a [[0b10]]-controlled main floor that appears on both -3 and -2. Research maps continue to amp up the difficulty in strength and number of general combat encounters, hacking difficulty, and difficulty in locating exits. Compared to the previous [[Factory]] floors, Research maps are just as big, but are much more maze-like with large numbers of smaller interconnected rooms and big sections of the level entirely disconnected by large chunks of earth. Exploring all of these different rooms is more difficult than before, and finding an exit can be a real challenge.
Unlike factory floors with [[Caves]] available, there are usually no easy exits to dissipate [[Alert]] in Research. The natural alert dissipation that occurs between levels continues to decrease. Purging alert or avoiding generating it in the first place can be a big deal if the player is not prepared to fight off [[High Security]]. [[Infowar]] continues to be important to avoid unnecessary encounters whenever possible, and [[Hackware]] should be used to purge alert and locate exits whenever possible.
As the difficulty increases, the rewards do to match. Many powerful unique parts can be found in Research specific branches [[Testing]] and [[Quarantine]]. There are also more [[Prototype Part|Prototypes]] lying around on the floor. Using a [[Component Analysis Suites|Component Analysis Suite]] can pay off to avoid attaching faulty prototypes.
A big change in Research is the final upgrade of Programmers. The 1-2 [[P-70 Sage|Sages]] per [[Extermination Squad|Extermination]] get upgraded to being 2-3 [[P-80 Master|Masters]]. The extra Programmer on average, higher core integrity, and higher damage output make them a serious threat to prepare for. Many builds will live or die based on how well they can handle Exterminations. Look for a way to kill in a single core shot, like using a [[Enh. Nova Cannon]]. Airborne builds can instead make use of recall hacks or get spotted and run away to avoid direct combat.
Other important Research level bot upgrades are [[Heavy|Heavies]] and [[Hunter|Hunters]] upgrading to their highest tier on -2. The [[H-81 Overseer]] deals a frightening 91 damage per volley, becomes even tougher to kill, and gains a visual upgrade to 22 tiles which is further than the telltale 20 tile range of the [[Active Sensor Suite]]. The [[H-88 Terminator]] is also a very formidable opponent. The scary changes here are the upgrade from an [[Imp. Phase Shifter]] to an [[Adv. Phase Shifter]] which makes them even more difficult to hit, and the Scan Cloak (4) trait which makes them invisible on [[Sensor Arrays]] unless using an [[Exp. Signal Interpreter]]. If fighting them head on, using [[Launchers]] to aim indirectly or Treads with [[Siege Mode]] can help a lot.

[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There are 4 types of main exits on Research floors. Most of them can't be identified via look alone:
[[List]]Main access exits: These always lead to the next main floor, either Research or [[Access]]. These can sometimes be identifiable by a 4 tile wide corridor that leads into a dead end with the exit in the middle. Otherwise, any non-prefab exit could be a main access exit. [[Signal Interpreters]] or [[Terminal]] access hacks are the main ways to identify these types of exits. There will always be 3 of these exits per map.|[[Spoiler]][[Quarantine]] exit: This is the only other type of exit that can be identified. Quarantine exits can sometimes be identified when they appear as a prefab with several locked or unlocked rows of blast doors. There are also otherwise unremarkable exits that can also lead to Quarantine. These exits will always be on the floor that there are no Testing exits on. There will always be 2 exits on the same depth that Quarantine is on.[[/Spoiler]]|[[Spoiler]][[Testing]] exit: These exits are always indistinguishable from any other type of exit.

There will only be 1 exit on the depth that Armory is on.[[/Spoiler]][[/List]]
One other type of additional exit is the [[DSF]]. These exits continue on from Factory and have the same auto-lock on hostile sight behavior. Getting inside is difficult.
[[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]
[[Spoiler]][[Image]]Research Revisions.png|Revision 17++ with Revision allies[[/Image]][[/Spoiler]]
There are 2 major Research-specific events. Both of these events can only be triggered by previous interactions Cogmind have had in [[Branch|branches]] and have major effects on the maps that they occur on:
[[Spoiler]][[Heading:2]]-3 [[Revision 17 (Alignment)|Revision 17 invasion]][[/Heading]]

If Revision 17 is rescued in [[Cetus]] and the Cetus Manufacturing Module machine survives, they will show up in a new form as [[Revision 17++]] and lead a group of 4 [[Revision|Revisions]] to follow Cogmind shortly after entering the map. More groups of Revisions will show up periodically and attack hostile 0b10 bots. Eventually, the Terminal network will be shut down, and [[Prototype Robot|Prototype]] [[Executioner|Executioners]] and [[Striker|Strikers]] will be dispatched along with assault [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]].
[[Image]]Research Warlord Entrance.png|Warlord making an entrance with friends[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]]-2 [[Warlord (Alignment)|Warlord Invasion]][[/Heading]]
If Warlord is aligned with in his [[Warlord (Location)|base]], he will bring huge groups of [[Derelict]] forces to attack Research. All traps on the floor will be disabled after 50 turns, and after 110 that the entire machine network will be turned offline, except for [[Garrison (Machine)|Garrisons]]. Waves of Derelicts will spawn on the left side of the map, while Assaults, [[D-83 Annihilator|D-83 Annihilators]], Strikers, and Executioners spawn from Garrisons and exits.[[/Spoiler]]"

Rescuing [[Revision 17]] in [[Cetus]] allows for a minor faction [[Alignment|alignment]]. If this is done, [[Revision 17++]] will attack [[0b10]] on the -3 [[Research]] map along with a lot of friendly [[Revision|Revisions]] as allies.This alignment is incompatible with [[Imprint|imprinting]] and Revision will flee from an imprinted Cogmind out of fear of the [[Imprinter]]. In order for the alignment to take effect, Revision 17 must survive until Cogmind exits the map, all 8 [[Cetus Guard|Cetus Guards]] must be destroyed, and the Cetus Manufacturing Module machine must be intact.
[[Heading]]-3 Research Invasion[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Research Revisions.png|Revision 17++ with Revision allies[[/Image]]
[[Image]]Research Suppression Forces.png|Suppression forces dispatched to fight the Revisions[[/Image]]
200 turns after entering the map, Revision 17++ will lead a group of 4 Revisions to follow Cogmind. They are uncontrollable allies but do not generate any alert for Cogmind when attacking. The announcement text [[GameText]]Unknown forces entering zones 8R, 1R, 4T. Local Systems Malfunctioning[[/GameText]] will precede their coming. Squads of 4 Revisions will continue to appear from main access exits every 200 turns. Occasionally a Revision will shout [[GameText]]Recycler![[/GameText]] and turn hostile, although this may also be followed by [[GameText]]##MEMORY:RESET##[[/GameText]] to turn them friendly again. 500 turns after Revision 17 arrives, an alert [[GameText]]Research terminal network lockdown[[/GameText]] will appear, and all Terminals on the map will shut down. Another alert will show up 50 turns later: [[GameText]]Suppression forces dispatched. All non-combat units evacuate.[[/GameText]] After this message, squads of 2 [[Executioner|Executioners]] or [[Striker|Strikers]] and an [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] will start to appear from exits and roam the map, looking for hostiles. They will also spawn every 200 turns.
There are a few other side-effects of this event. One is that explosive machines will explode at random whenever Cogmind is nearby. This can be good when fighting enemies around explosive machines, but be wary of them when walking around the map or else they may surprise you at a bad time. Another is that mapgen is affected. [[Heavy|Heavies]] will not appear on a map that Revision 17 invades.
This event can be a great blessing or a curse depending on a lot of factors. Getting an escort of alert-free allies with other squads of allies roaming the map is great. They will clean up most of the map for you and can net some free prototype bot loot. Blocking Heavy spawns is incredibly useful here as well. The downsides can also be pretty major, however. Losing access to all Terminals by turn 500 can be very bad if Cogmind is on slow propulsion and has no exit intel and no form of terrain scanning. Trying to  follow the spawning Revisions or suppression forces can lead to an exit, although it can be a bit unreliable. Another downside is that the Revisions will often create a ton of squads to appear right at the beginning of the event. Sometimes, large groups of [[Operator|Operators]] and alarm traps can all be triggered at nearly the same time. This can result in massive groups of hostiles to appear right in Cogmind's face with unlucky exit or Garrison positioning."

"Scrap Engine","Part","Scrap Engine is a unique [[Derelict]] part that can only be obtained by stealing from the [[Recycling#Scraplab|Scraplab in Recycling]]. It has the capability to create powerful constructs by combining many different parts into one. It can create power constructs of up to 4 slots, propulsion up to 8 slots, and weapons of up to 4 slots. When more of Cogmind's slots are dedicated to constructs, they will also get more powerful overall.
The Scrap Engine can create combinations of parts that would never be seen normally, such as energy cannons dealing kinetic damage with heat transfer, or 50 speed treads. Modifications to the constructs will only change a few stats at a time, so overall variability is extremely high when using the engine. Modifying a construct with a flight unit may result in a much higher speed, or it may dramatically reduce the integrity and support instead. Every part that is eaten can be a gamble, since the stats that are modified are random every time.
[[Heading]]Processing Parts/Inventory[[/Heading]]
The Scrap Engine can be fed parts by enabling it and standing on top of a part. Once eaten, a part will remain in the Scrap Engine's inventory until it is used for creating a new construct or for modifying an existing one. Up to 10 power, propulsion, protection, and weapons can be stored (counted separately for each part type). This inventory can be used as a pseudo-storage mechanism by preemptively eating a part and disabling the Scrap Engine to prevent use until later. This is more efficient than keeping parts in regular inventory, but is more restrictive since the parts used for modification can't be explicitly selected anymore. If over 10 parts of a given type is fed to the engine, the first part in the engine's inventory will be destroyed.
[[Heading:2]]Broken/Faulty parts[[/Heading]]
The output of the Scrap Engine is not negatively affected by inputting low-integrity, broken, or faulty parts. As such, it may be a good idea to feed these parts to the Scrap Engine instead of throwing them away or letting them become totally destroyed.
[[Heading:2]]Protection parts[[/Heading]]
Rather than going toward creating new constructs, protection is instead used to reinforce the Scrap Engine itself. The first time that a protection item is consumed, the Scrap Engine will turn itself into the [[Arm. Scrap Engine]], gaining more coverage and integrity. Every subsequent armor piece consumed will restore 100 Scrap Engine integrity.
[[Heading]]Creating constructs[[/Heading]]
If 2 power, 3 propulsion, or 4 weapons are stored in the engine's inventory at once, a new construct can be created by combining all of the parts into a new one. Duplicates of a part may be used in new constructions, but at least 2 unique parts must be involved in new construct creation. Note: There is a maximum of 1 power and 1 propulsion construct each at a time, but up to 4 weapon constructs can be created. New constructs are created with a mix of the stats of the original items put into them. The Scrap Engine will preferentially create new constructs as opposed to modifying existing ones.
[[Heading:2]]Naming[[/Heading]]
The names of constructs are generated from a combination of parts processed up to that point. For example, eating an [[Ion Engine]] and a [[Nuclear Core]] may result in a Nuclear-Ion Core. Further modifications may cause the name to change over time.
[[Heading:2]]Type[[/Heading]]
The initial type of a construct will be selected randomly from its original parts. This can cause unusual stats, such as treads much faster than typically seen when created in combination with a faster propulsion type like flight. Like names, the type of a construct can change over time with more modifications. Propulsion constructs gain all natural ability of the propulsion type, like a flight construct granting bot hopping, or a leg construct granting running avoidance bonuses.
[[Heading]]Modification[[/Heading]]
Constructs can be modified when at least 2 different parts are stored in the Scrap Engine's inventory at a given time. For example, 2 [[Aluminum Leg|Aluminum Legs]] would not result in modification, but 1 Aluminum Leg and 1 [[Imp. Aluminum Leg]] would cause a modification, as would 1 Aluminum Leg and 1 [[Flight Unit]].
Each time a construct is modified, 1-5 random stats (generally higher numbers for weapons, lower numbers for power and propulsion) are modified based on the parts that were just processed. Additionally, if there is a slot available, the modified construct may grow in size. The growing chance decreases as the construct gets bigger, so increasing from 1 slot to 2 slots is much easier than increasing from 2 to 3. Additionally, modifying a construct will restore about 1/3 of its integrity.
[[Heading:2]]Multiple slots[[/Heading]]
When parts evolve into multiple slots, some of the stats also scale proportionally. Resource costs always scale in accordance with the number of slots, as will integrity and coverage. Aside from that, primary aspects of the slot type like energy generation, support, and damage will all scale based on slot number. Stats that are percentage based, like overload burnout and critical hit chance, don't tend to change based on slot counts.
One unique interaction between multiple weapon constructs is the ability to merge. Rather than growing into a unique 2 slot weapon construct, sometimes 2 existing constructs will combine into a single multislot construct. The stats of both component constructs will be mixed together into the resultant construct.
[[Heading:2]]Special Abilities[[/Heading]]
Non-standard/special stats/abilities may be given to the constructs based on the type of part eaten. For example, eating a Cld. power source such as a [[Cld. Ion Engine]] may grant the ability to overload the power construct. These special stats/abilities may also be removed at random by further modifications. If a construct has a stat specific to a part type, such as overload on a flight/propulsion type, and changes to a new type that no longer supports it, such as treads, that special stat will be removed.
[[Heading:3]]List of special stats/abilities applicable to constructs[[/Heading]]
[[Table]]Slot|Stat/ability|Part to consume|Loss on type change?||Power|Overload|Any Cld. power source like [[Cld. Ion Engine]]|Never||Propulsion|Overload|Any Cld. flight or hover unit like [[Surge Thruster]]|Change to Wheel, Leg, or Treads||Propulsion|Siege Mode|Any 2 slot treads like [[Hvy. Siege Treads]]|Change to non-Treads||Weapon|Overload|Any Cld. energy weapon like [[Cld. Particle Cannon]]|Change to non-Energy Cannon/Gun||Weapon|Waypoints|Any guided weapon like [[Gui. Plasma Cannon]]|Never||Weapon|[[Spoiler]]Entropic damage type, additionally loss of integrity per shot[[/Spoiler]]|[[Spoiler]]Any Vortex weapon like [[Vortex Rifle]][[/Spoiler]]|Never[[/Table]]
[[Heading]]Part destruction[[/Heading]]
Unlike most parts, constructs are not always instantly destroyed when they run out of integrity. Any multislot parts are instead reduced in slot count and partially restored in integrity. Though the slot may be hard to regrow again, it does make constructs more resilient than they first might appear. The only exception to this rule is that a Vortex weapon construct will be entirely destroyed if it runs out of integrity due to being fired.
When any construct is forced to shrink in size via damage, fully destroyed, or manually removed, the Scrap Engine will be slightly damaged in the process, reporting that [[GameText]]Scrap Engine damaged due to network destabilization[[/GameText]].
[[Heading]]General Strategies[[/Heading]]
Scrap Engine tends to be a very powerful but often unreliable part. It can generate abnormally powerful constructs, far outstripping anything else available, and then snatch the positive aspects of them away and leave you with a weapon that generates 400 heat per shot. As such, making modifications with a lot of spare parts around is always a good idea to reduce the chance of getting stuck with a hard to use part. On the other hand, if a great construct is created, it may often be worth postponing further modifications until needed to repair integrity. Otherwise, the best qualities may be lost before long.
A good strategy is to approach the modifications with moderation. Going all in on thermal energy cannons may result in a high damaging high meltdown weapon, but may also spike your own heat generation past reasonable levels. Mixing in lower heat generating kinetic guns and cannons will tend to balance your weapons out with more sustainable energy and heat resource costs. Propulsion can be approached similarly. Eating a mixture of hover, legs, and tread propulsion will tend toward middle of the road constructs that aren't amazing at anything in particular, but you will rarely end up with the excessive highs and lows that can occur if only one type of propulsion is focused on. Additionally, being more lenient in what you eat will help keep constructs topped off on integrity.
For a higher risk higher reward approach, mixing extremes like treads and flight can result in some incredibly overpowered propulsion constructs. A primarily treads-orientated propulsion construct only needs a single good flight modification to take the speed down to close to the 40 speed range. However, bad modification can instead lose lots of integrity or support. Doing this is safer with a lot of spare parts to eat in case things go south. Another example of a beneficial extreme is combining high critical rate Hyp. weapons like [[Hyp. Gauss Cannon]] with meltdown criticals from thermal cannons. It is possible to create an abnormally high meltdown critical % weapon this way, at the risk of losing some weapon damage.
[[Heading:2]]Multi-projectile Weapons[[/Heading]]
[[Flak Gun|Flak Guns]] can produce excellent constructs due to their high projectile count. While some stats get reduced to compensate for the increased projectile count, it is still possible to achieve overall high damage and a high critical percent chance. It is even possible to go beyond the original weapon's projectile count (6 in the case of Flak Guns). Heat transfer is another good stat to apply to a large projectile construct. A high heat transfer combined with a high projectile count can melt bots nearly instantly.
[[Heading:2]]Miscellaneous Tips[[/Heading]]
[[List]]Have a stockpile of parts before equipping the Scrap Engine - Recycling is a good place to get a strong start on constructs due to the large number of different types of parts to eat, and the lack of big threats. If saving Scrap Engine for later, try to create a good sized loot pile ahead of time to get a head start on growing the constructs.|Don't go all in on EM damage - If all of your weapon slots are a single construct of EM type damage and you run into a [[Programmer]], you're going to have a rough time.|Be careful of destroying cover - Construct weapons tends to be much more powerful than typical weapons and will blow through walls right and left. This is good in some situations, but it can also leave you wide open to multiple angles of attack.|Leave a slot open for a [[Launchers]] - Dedicating all of your weapon slots to constructs makes it hard to deal with [[Swarmer|Swarmers]] or other large groups of hostiles.|Make careful [[Storage Unit|Storage]] selections - Larger storage units like [[Hcp. Storage Unit]] and above may be difficult to carry if flight and hover propulsion are eaten. Smaller storage units can be carried more easily without overweight penalties with a bad support modifications.|Modify constructs with slots open - If trying to grow a construct, make sure that an empty slot is available for growth. This is especially the case for weapon constructs. Even though two weapon constructs may occasionally merge into a single multislot construct, it is more reliable to grow the slot number by keeping one available.|Don't have more than 3 weapons in engine inventory at a time - If trying to grow a weapon construct in number of slots, having 4 parts in inventory with an open weapon slot will always result in a new construct being created rather than having the existing construct modified. It may take a little longer, but making sure to process only 2 at a time will ensure maximum modifications and the highest chance to grow a weapon construct in slot count. [[/List]]"

Scraptown contains many different groups of Derelicts and most have various rooms that can appear from run to run. The overall layout of Scraptown is the same each run, but the rooms will contain different combinations of groups each time. There are C-Scrubber machines at the entrance and all exits on this map that will cleanse corruption, and their use is recommended to avoid misfiring and causing accidental hostilities.
The map always consists of an open left area that all bots are free to explore. The map is divided by a giant UFD HQ Gate with [[Triborg]] guarding nearby. The gate has 60 armor and high resistances to all main damage types except for Thermal damage. Realistically, the only options to cut through are [[Plasma Cutters|Plasma Cutter]] or the [[Siege Cannon]]. However, the gate will open automatically if Cogmind becomes UFD aligned. The right side of the map contains many more unique rooms.
[[Heading]]Alignment - [[UFD]][[/Heading]]
Talking to the Scrapper standing next to the UFD registry near the HQ gate will allow Cogmind to become a UFD member and enter the right side of the map. This alignment is only possible if Cogmind is not [[RIF]]-aligned, has not taken [[Farcom]], and has not stolen or attacked the [[Exiles (Group)|Exiles]].
Aside from access to the right side of the map, Cogmind also gains access to 2 new [[Recycling Machine]] hacks [[GameText]]Force(Scrapoids)[[/GameText]] to summon [[Scrapoid|Scrapoids]] and [[GameText]]Force(Fedlink)[[/GameText]] to allocate more resources to the UFD recycling network.
[[Heading]]Hostilities[[/Heading]]
The UFD is typically friendly to Cogmind but will turn hostile if Cogmind attacks a bot or digs through any dirt or machine tiles. There are a large amount of bots that will turn hostile to Cogmind, so attacking should not be done lightly. If Cogmind is capable of taking down all of its inhabitants, there are a large number of unique items that are only available by attacking Scraptown.
[[Heading:2]]Attack Mechanics[[/Heading]]

[[Image]]Scraptown Cartography Club Solve.png|Steps to solve the Cartography Club Maze (may be mirrored)[[/Image]]
The Cartography Club contains multiple rewards that are locked behind a maze. These items are a [[Mapping Drone Bay]] (not guaranteed), a [[Surveybot 17 Chip]] (not guaranteed), a Terminal filled with various forms of map intel (guaranteed), and a [[Deep Structural Scanner]] (guaranteed). In order to perform steps 4-6, Cogmind must be at least 50 speed. A grounded bot can temporarily purge items in order to complete the puzzle, as core hover is enough speed.
The maze may mirrored horizontally from the example image. The following steps will solve the maze:

[[Heading]]Fighting Scraptown[[/Heading]]
Scraptown is a challenging area to fight. The majority of the armed bots are individually weak, but in the dozens they can overwhelm Cogmind and wear down any defenses. Many unique items are only obtainable by destroying terrain or killing certain bots, which can make attacking Scraptown a promising endeavor. However, there is a serious drawback of going for a full clear or even smashing a container for one item and running: The [[Zion]] and [[Warlord (Location)]] maps will become hostile when Cogmind tries to enter them.
[[Heading:2]]Items obtainable by murder[[/Heading]]

Humpback - Curator's Association Exhibit[[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]Requirements[[/Heading]]
In order to effectively full clear Scraptown, there are a few general requirements:
[[Heading:3]]Triborg Solve[[/Heading]]
Triborg is by far the scariest individual bot on the map with an incredibly powerful [[Siege Cannon]] that can quickly kill an unprepared Cogmind. Siege mode brings Triborg's initially high 40% core exposure down to a significantly reduced 28% which makes direct damage dealing a rather inefficient method. An EM resistance of 65% doesn't help an EM approach much either, with an average requirement of 285 EM damage to be dealt before corruption death. Very little conventional weaponry can deal enough damage to eliminate Triborg in a reasonable amount of time.
The most reliable way to beat Triborg is with meltdown. Large groups of allies with heat transfer can easily overheat Triborg before it gets much chance to deal damage. [[Storage]] frequently has a vault of 10 [[Grunt|Grunts]] that will become friendly to Cogmind upon entry. These 10 Grunts are sufficient to melt Triborg within a few volleys, if not instantly. [[Army Drone|Army Drones]] from [[Army-in-a-Box]] can also produce sufficient heat transfer for an easy kill. [[DAS Turret|DAS Turrets]] from Deploy-a-Sentry do not have heat transfer but have extremely high damage output, so if Cogmind can hold Triborg's fire, 3 or 4 turrets taken from the Exiles can deal enough conventional damage for core destruction.
Aside from allies, there are few other Exiles Prototypes that can handle the Triborg fight reasonably well:
[[List]][[AWS/Autocannon]]: The Autocannon has an incredibly high damage output that can take Triborg out within 4 core hits.|[[Field Lobotomy Kit]]: Triborg is not Disruption immune so the FLK will instantly turn a threat into a useful ally|[[Firepult]]: Firepult has sufficient heat transfer to melt Triborg with ease. Make sure to pack plenty of cooling to use this early.|[[YOLO Cannon]]: YOLO Cannon's high 50% meltdown critical easily kills Triborg. Note: the AOE effect of YOLO cannon may damage the loot on the ground.[[/List]]
[[Heading:3]]Trash Killer[[/Heading]]
Cogmind should have an efficient way of dealing with the dozens of average to weak strength bots that will swarm Scraptown after hostilities begin. Any decent rating parts can solve this, although some parts are particularly good at this role. This is an essential role as merely passable weapons will result in Cogmind taking a lot of damage in the long run as each bot gets a few shots off before being destroyed. Here are some above average parts for the job:
[[List]]AWS/Autocannon: Autocannon has enough damage to core any bot on this level, builtin targeting, fires beyond Cogmind's vision, and even has no upkeep cost.|[[AWS/Gauss]]: Notably worse than the Autocannon with significantly lower damage, but still good for similar traits. With 3 weapon slots, can be combined with another non-AWS weapon for additional damage.|[[AWS/Thermal]]: As powerful as the AWS/Gauss but suffers from a significant range decrease to 14. Should be used in close quarters as kinetic bots can outrange this part.|Siege Cannon: Easily lootable off of Triborg with a CPS Tube. This requires the use of [[Tri-treads]] also dropped from Triborg to enter siege mode and avoid the recoil chance.|[[Hvy. Assault Cannon]]: High range and sufficient damage to one shot any bot on core.|DAS Turrets have high visual range (22) and will kill every bot in one core hit. Keep in mind that eventually they will run low on matter and take longer to fire.|Storage Grunt Army: While they don't last forever, a well positioned Grunt army can act as a firing squad for bots that wander into their line of sight.|Army-in-a-Box: Similar to a Grunt army, only there's a lot more Army Drones available. Don't use too many at once or else they will get in each others' way.[[/List]]
[[Heading:3]]Way to cut through to right side[[/Heading]]
It is a much easier task to avoid becoming a UFD member and opening the gate before hostilities. In order to do this and still perform a full clear, Cogmind must have a way to dig through the HQ gate. The only options are a Siege Cannon from Triborg, a [[Plasma Cutter]], a YOLO Cannon, or an EM [[Launchers]] like an [[EMP Blaster]] with rating 3 or higher engines. The [[Imp. Deuterium Engine|Imp. Deuterium Engines]] dropped by Elites are a good choice for EM Launchers.
[[Heading:3]]Essential Parts[[/Heading]]
No NPC murder setup is complete without a few highly essential build components:
[[List]]Backup Treads: Cogmind can easily salvage Triborg for Tri-treads and those should be used if possible. However, depending on Cogmind's starting position, it may be possible to be stuck fighting without having time to move over to the Triborg loot and swapping to the treads. Additionally, if Cogmind happens to miss a CPS tube, a lot of essential loot may not drop.|Backup Wheels (Optional): [[Wheels]] are useful to temporarily swap on to move quickly. Useful for picking up matter out of Tractor Beam range.|Backup Armor: Self-explanatory. Triborg drops [[Mak. Medium Armor Plating]] and [[Elite|Elites]] drop [[Mak. Light Armor Plating]] to use in a pinch.|Backup Weapons: Aside from Siege Cannon, most of the weapons dropped by NPCs on this map are not ideal for Cogmind to use in Scraptown.|Backup Power: Self-explanatory.|[[Cooling Devices]] (optional): Siege Cannon in particular is hot to use in prolonged combat.|[[Targeting Computers]]/[[Weapon Cyclers]]/[[Core Analyzers]] (optional): Useful offensive utilities|[[Hardlight Generators]]/[[Shield Generators/Force Fields]] (optional): Useful defensive utilities|[[Tractor Beam|Normal]] or [[Hpw. Tractor Beam]] and [[Matter Compressors]] (optional): Siege cannon requires a lot of matter to use. Matter storage and Tractor Beams allow Cogmind to continue to fight in extended encounters without having to reposition to collect more matter.|[[Adv. Visual Processing Unit]]/[[Seismic Detector]] (optional): With long ranged weapons like Siege Cannon, it is best to hit enemies before they can see you and outside of their visual range.[[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]When to Kill[[/Heading]]
Generally, a build should be designed for killing Scraptown several maps ahead of time. This will typically involve going to [[Exiles (Location)]] and either taking [[Farcom]] or killing/stealing for powerful Exiles prototypes that can handle Scraptown kills. Scraptown kills are best done on -8 or -7 for this reason. While it is still possible to kill on -9, it will be much more difficult with the small number of slots and no potential for Exiles prototypes. Cogmind should have at least 3 propulsion slots and 3 weapon slots to use Tri-treads and Siege Cannon from Triborg.
[[Heading:2]]Location to Fight[[/Heading]]
When engaging hostilities, there are 2 best points where Cogmind can choose to start the fight:
[[Heading:3]]Next to the UFD Gate[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Scraptown Triborg Surrounded.png|Grunts surrounding Triborg prepared to melt it down, with nearby Protector[[/Image]]
The gate is the best place to begin if Cogmind has allies or a quick way to neutralize Triborg. There is lots of room so allies won't have to run past each other or try to shoot through each other like they would in hallways. This area also has favorable sightlines if Cogmind has vision utilities or a DAS Turret to work with Siege Cannon. Allies should be positioned around Triborg in a box as shown to the right. If a [[Protector]] is available, place it close to the Gate so it is more out of harms way.
[[Heading:3]]Bottom Left Corner[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Scraptown Bottom Left Triborg Path.png|Path Triborg should take if in the bottom left corner[[/Image]]
If Cogmind the only solution for Triborg is brute force like with an AWS/Autocannon, it may be better to hide in the corner of the map so that bots do not swarm the center more quickly than Cogmind can kill them. Stay in the position shown in the image to the right to begin hostilities. When Triborg peeks around the corner, move up a few tiles so Triborg is forced to move closer to Cogmind to shoot. The right side path to this location is a little short, but the top path can take good advantage of the large sightlines.
[[Heading:2]]Beginning Hostilities[[/Heading]]
If Cogmind starts the Scraptown assault near Triborg, the #1 priority is to use a CPS tube on Triborg to ensure full salvage drops. Take out Triborg with whatever means are available, then grab and equip the Tri-treads and Siege Cannon (if slots available). If fighting in the corner, start by either shooting a wall out or killing any nearby bot. Lure Triborg close and use the CPS Tube, then go for the kill. After Triborg is dead, stay put and slowly clear out the UFD reinforcements. This process can take a large amount of time as the bots wander the map slowly instead of making a targeted assault on Cogmind.
At this point, patience is key. Leaving too soon can cause a lot of extra shots up on Cogmind. Generally, only moving around to collect more matter when needed is the best strategy here. Otherwise, stay put until close to 60 bots or so have been killed. After bots stops showing up, it is fairly safe to explore the rest of the left side and clear out the few remaining stragglers. Take this chance to evaluate the essentials and backups situation and pick up parts from the ground as needed.
[[Heading:2]]Opening the gate[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Scraptown Wall Dig.png|Digging past the gate[[/Image]]
Once the left side is fully cleared out, the right side must be opened with a Siege Cannon, Plasma Cutter, or YOLO Cannon. Siege cannon is preferred because it can penetrate a single tile-wide line through the gate. This kind of layout works best so that bots don't swarm out. It works well with the high penetration capabilities of the Siege Cannon too. A diagonal dig as shown to the right is preferred; even if a few missed shots destroy parts of the wall, it is more difficult for multiple bots to get an angle on Cogmind to shoot past each other.
The right side is mostly more of the same. Wait for bots to come to you from your safe position. There are another roughly 60 bots to kill on this side of the map. Otherwise, there is nothing too special about this portion as long as Cogmind has enough spare parts to last without the build falling apart. After the bots stop wandering by, walk into the right side of the wall. There will be 4 Elites patrolling in the center-most HQ area. Take them out and the loot should be yours for the taking. The only other hostiles that can appear after clearing out all of the roamers are an [[Autobeam Turret]] in the Curator's Exhibit, which shouldn't be much of an issue at this point, and an Explorer or two behind the walls in the Cartography Club.
[[Heading:2]]Loot Time[[/Heading]]
Most of the loot should be fairly self explanatory to grab. A few less obvious ones:
[[List]]Smash open the wall hiding a Schematic in IN-MT5's Study|Dig out the corners in the Curator's Association because one will have an extra item|Dig through the back of the Scrapoid Pod storage to get many more pods|Dig out the center earth tile in LU-1G1's Boring Crew room|Check rooms closed for remodeling for the rare Exp. Plasma Cutter|Smash open the wall hiding additional Botcubes in the Botcube Research room[[/List]]"
"Scrapyard","Location","The starting point of every game. At the start of every game there is a semi-random fixed spawn of: [[Sml. Storage Unit]], 2 [[Lgt. Treads]], 2 [[Aluminum Leg]], a mix of 2 [[Wheel]] or [[Com. Wheel]], a mix of 2 [[Ion Engine]] or [[Lgt. Ion Engine]], and a mix of 3 [[Lgt. Assault Rifle]], [[Assault Rifle]], [[EM Pulse Gun]], [[Sml. Laser]], [[Med. Laser]]. If the advanced game option quickStart is set, all of the parts will be either collected or equipped.[[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]A team of [[T-07 Excavator|Tunnelers]] and [[U-05 Engineer|Engineers]] will dig out and finish rooms over time. The rooms themselves do not contain anything of importance.[[Image]]Scrapyard Assembled Event.png|Assembled after ambushing a Tunneler[[/Image]]However, after several thousand turns of waiting, an Tunneler may dig open a small dug out area containing a large number of [[Assembled (4)|Assembled]]. This will prompt a response of an [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] containing 2 [[D-53 Grenadier|Demolishers]] which can be a good early source of [[Cmb. Airjet]] if they are destroyed by the assembled. Waiting around for this event can be fairly risky since there is no way to prepare for the fight and it is very easy to get destroyed by either the demolishers or the assembled."
"Scythe","Part",""
"Search Patrol","Other","Search patrols are a unique type of [[0b10]] aligned [[Patrol Squad|patrol squad]]. They can be dispatched if Cogmind generates a lot of [[Alert]] from non-combat sources. This is primarily caused by being spotted by [[Watcher|Watchers]] or [[N-01 Spotter|Spotters]], guard bots like [[Sentry|Sentries]], or by being spotted by any combat hostile and then running away and losing tracking. If the Alert level is above the typical [[Assault Squad|Assault]] range of level 2/400 influence and Cogmind has gained the majority of the influence from these non-combat sources, there is a chance that one or more search patrols may be dispatched. If a search patrol is announced, influence will drop by 150. This will be accompanied by the alert [[GameText]]ALERT: Heightened foreign activity detected, dispatching search patrol.[[/GameText]] The alert will also indicate if multiple search patrols are to be sent out simultaneously. One or more ARCs will be dispatched after a few more turns. These ARCs behave similarly as regular patrol ARCs and have the same standard patrol contents within them. However, search squads will choose random points on the map to patrol to rather than having a fixed patrol route like all other patrols."
"Section 7","Location","Section 7 is a [[0b10]]-controlled [[Research]] [[Branch]] off of either [[Testing]] or [[Quarantine]] that always appears on -3 or -2. Quarantine must come before Section 7, so a -3 Testing followed by Section 7 is not possible. Compared to the previous branches, Section 7 is a lot tougher and more like a regular Research floor. Patrols are denser, [[Sentry|Sentries]] and [[Heavy|Heavies]] are present on the map, and [[Researcher|Researchers]] are present in higher numbers and have a worse scan effects. However, the [[Alien Artifact]] unique parts can be quite gamechanging and can include effects like strong weaponry, part integrity regeneration effects, and permanent buffs to Cogmind for the remainder of the game. This map is also home to powerful [[S7 Guard|S7 Guards]] that guard some of the more powerful and unique Artifacts. Like all Research branches, [[Farcom]] will trigger [[Maximum Security]] upon entry.
The left side of the map is different each run, but the right half, the ""hangar"", is always static. The hangar primarily contains large pieces of machinery used for the construction of a ship based after the Leopard, the [[Sigix]] ship that attacked 0b10. It also contains various Alien Artifacts, an LRC cache containing related Artifacts and is where LRC versions are tested, and several dormant prototype bot guards. The top section of this area is locked by Sealed Heavy Doors with 50 armor and strong resistances to all major damage types except for thermal damage.
[[Heading:2]]Getting Scanned[[/Heading]]
Attacking when in visual range of a Researcher or attacking a Researcher will result in them turning yellow and attempting to stasis and scan any hostiles. Whenever any bot is caught in stasis, the Researcher will summon a [[Reinforcement Squad]] to its current position. Unlike the Q-Series spawns of Testing/Quarantine, if Cogmind is scanned in Section 7, it will also result in [[Intercept Squad|Intercepts]] being summoned. These Intercepts are extremely dangerous to unprepared builds, combat and stealth alike. To avoid unintentionally scanning, detach any ranged weapons whenever a Researcher is in line of sight of Cogmind. Melee weapons, special weapons like [[Datajacks]], and any type of guided weapon are safe to keep equipped to avoid misfires due to [[Corruption]].

The Warrior will follow Cogmind as a normal ally and can be used for the W3 [[Wintypes|Wintype]]. When fighting, the Sigix Warrior will sometimes log the message [[GameText]]Synergy achieved. Target locked: {target}[[/GameText]]. When this occurs, both the Warrior and Cogmind will gain a 15% targeting bonus against the target.
If a [[Core Reset Matrix]] is used, the log message [[GameText]]Sigix Exoskeleton lights up in response to your presence[[/GameText]], and attempting to walk into it will add [[GameText]]Exoskeleton opens, ready for integration override sequence[[/GameText]]. Repeating the movement will force Cogmind into the Exoskeleton and strip all parts. Cogmind will receive innate buffs to energy storage, energy generation, and heat dissipation depending on how many slots were ""consumed"" as a part of this process. The final slot distribution is 1 power slot, 3 propulsion slots (with an nondetachable Sigix Exoskeleton part), 3 utility slots, and 2 weapon slots that are filled with (detachable) Sigix Shearguns. Evolution can occur as normal from this point on. Most parts will be well protected with the extremely high coverage of the Exoskeleton, but as a tradeoff Cogmind takes 25% of all damage dealt to the Exoskeleton additionally as core damage. Some additional benefits are an 18-radius perfect robot, terrain, and item detection info, a distance from exit indicator, and spawns of [[Assembled (7)|Assembled]] from the ground in main 0b10 floors and [[Command]].
If either Cogmind wearing the Exoskeleton or the Sigix Warrior are spotted by a hostile, [[Maximum Security]] will immediately be engaged.
[[Heading:3]]Power Cell[[/Heading]]
One of the machines in the hangar is the Power Cell. It is a heavily armored and extremely explosive machine, with a 20 radius 250 entropic damage explosion that will instantly destroy all hostiles in range. One of the [[Lab]] orders that are accessible when using the [[Data Conduit]] will provide a manual explosion code. The Power Cell Monitoring Terminal will accept this code and start a 20 turn countdown before the machine explodes.
[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There is only one exit in Section 7. The main access exit that leads to the next Research or [[Access]] floor can be found at a dead end of a 4 tile corridor near either the top-middle or bottom-middle of the map."

"Security Squad","Other","[[Image]]Security Squad Heavy.png|A Heavy guarding a busy intersection[[/Image]]
Security squads are [[0b10]] aligned [[Squad|squads]] that guard a single location and do not move unless alerted to hostiles. While they are called squads, security bots nearly always work alone and do not come in groups. Security bots tend to be guarding busy exits, corridors, [[Interactive Machine|interactive machines]], and part stockpiles. These squads are primary composed of [[Behemoth|Behemoths]], [[Heavy|Heavies]], and [[Sentry|Sentries]]. They tend to be present on the map when Cogmind enters, and don't appear in greater numbers as time goes on. The main exception to this is Heavies, which may be replenished by the [[Security Rotation]] event, although there will typically never be more than the initial number of Heavies on a map. Security squads can be Enumerated at [[Terminal|Terminals]], but only within a very limited radius of 20 tiles.

Cryocooling Duct machines may be sometimes found in Quarantine. These machines the ambient temperature of the map by default, but if 2 are destroyed, the ambient heat will rise up to +20. If this happens, all combat bots will be withdrawn from the map, and 12 [[Quarantine Guard|Quarantine Guards]] will be dispatched after about 100 turns. These bots will guard various high traffic parts of the map, while others patrol the map. A few will guard exits, as well as a Garrison, if one is present.[[/Spoiler]]"

They wield dual Kinetic and Thermal guns at each tier. Sentries tend to be slightly more durable than most other bots at their depth. Sentries typically stand guard alone as a [[Security Squad]].
Sentries have no particular weakness, and so most weapon types can be used to dispatch them. Electromagnetic damage is efficient at killing the higher tier bots, and EM is good in general at increasing the chances of looting their treads and armor.
While combat bots will want (or will be forced) to fight Sentries head-on, airborne builds may want to avoid them or at least avoid getting shot by them. One way to do this is to use a [[Terminology#Partial Spot|partial spot]] to lure the Sentry out of their position. After that, Cogmind may be able to use the guarded machine or exit, or grab the loot without being spotted. A fast Cogmind may also be able to use the long memory of Sentries to their advantage while being spotted regularly. It is possible to lead Sentries far out of position and then leave them in the dust to grab their guarded loot.

The Sigix Exoskeleton is an [[Alien Artifact]] that is only found in [[Section 7]]. Initially it is found on an unpowered [[Sigix Warrior]] named Sigix Exoskeleton in the bottom right corner of the hangar. If Cogmind has used a [[Core Reset Matrix]] (CRM), it is possible to enter the Exoskeleton, which dramatically alters gameplay for the rest of the current run.
[[Heading]]Unique effects[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:3]]Additional Core Damage[[/Heading]]
Roughly 1/3 of all damage dealt to the Sigix Exoskeleton is also dealt to Cogmind's core.
[[Heading:3]]Alien Weapon Damage Boost[[/Heading]]
All non-AOE attacks from Sigix weapons is doubled. However, this effect does not stack with things like [[Particle Chargers]]. The full list of affected weapons is as follows: [[Core Cannon]], [[Core Stripper]], [[Modified Sigix Sheargun]], [[Sigix Broadsword]], [[Sigix Shearcannon]], and [[Sigix Sheargun]]
[[Heading:3]][[Assembled]] Absorption[[/Heading]]
While the Exoskeleton is damaged, Assembled can be absorbed to repair it by 30 integrity when standing next to Cogmind.
[[Heading:3]]Core Dependence[[/Heading]]
Cogmind's core becomes dependent on the Exoskeleton. Even if Cogmind still has remaining core, if the Exoskeleton is destroyed the game will instantly be loss.
[[Heading:3]]Enhanced Hypermatrix Pings[[/Heading]]
Whenever entering a new floor with Assembled spawns available (all main 0b10-controlled floors, [[DSF|DSFs]], and [[Command]]), 6-8 Assembled will appear near Cogmind. Additionally, the Exoskeleton provides the CRM's hypermatrix ping detection and Assembled summoning ability at all times rather than only while at 1/3 core.
[[Heading:3]]Damage Reduction[[/Heading]]
The Exoskeleton provides a 50% damage resistance to all conventional damage types. This effect stacks with [[Shield Generators/Force Fields]], but not with other [[Resistance Devices]].
[[Heading:3]]Deactivation-Proof[[/Heading]]
The Exoskeleton cannot be deactivated by any means. This includes manual deactivation as well as [[Heat]]-based side-effects.
[[Heading:3]]Infowar[[/Heading]]
The Exoskeleton provides extremely powerful sensor intel in an 18 tile radius. Perfect bot detection, terrain scanning, part detection, and hidden door detection is granted within this radius.
[[Heading:3]]High Coverage[[/Heading]]
While not exactly a unique ability, the Exoskeleton has a uniquely high 30,000 coverage which dwarfs every other item's coverage in the game. Most typical forms of armor are entirely unhelpful with the Exoskeleton equipped.
[[Heading:3]][[Maximum Security]] Triggering[[/Heading]]
As soon as Cogmind is spotted by any combat hostile in most [[0b10]]-controlled maps, Maximum Security will be immediately engaged. One notable exception is that Maximum Security will not be triggered in Command. Non-combat [[Watcher|Watchers]] and [[Operator|Operators]] whose associated [[Terminal]] hasn't be destroyed will also trigger this effect.
[[Image]]Exoskeleton4x.png|Cogmind's new look[[/Image]]
[[Heading:3]]New Appearance[[/Heading]]
Cogmind will take on the Sigix Warrior artwork, or the uppercase X character in ASCII mode.
[[Heading:3]]Slot Fixing[[/Heading]]
When Cogmind enters the Exoskeleton, all slots will be reset to a total of 1 Power, 3 Propulsion, 3 Utility, and 2 Weapon slots. However, Cogmind gets some boosts in exchange for the slots. Cogmind gains 100 fixed energy capacity, and every slot above the new 9 total slot count provides 3 innate energy generation and 5 heat dissipation. Not counting [[Core Expander|Core Expanders]], a typical -3 Section 7 provides 36 energy and 60 dissipation while a -2 Section 7 provides 42 energy and 70 dissipation. Slots can be evolved as normal after entering the Exoskeleton, including using Core Expanders. As a side-note, a [[Core Physics Calibrator]] cannot remove the 3 propulsion slots and force removal of the Exoskeleton.
[[Heading:3]]UI Intel[[/Heading]]
There are 4 new pieces of intel located at the bottom of the inventory UI:
[[List]]Threats: Counts the number of active hostiles within sensor radius.|Components: Counts the number of parts on the floor within sensor radius.|Ping number: Counts the number of active but untriggered Assembled hypermatrix pings.|Tor distance: Lists the distance to the Tor, the Sigix spaceship. The number in thousands place varies based on the map, but up to the hundreds place, it roughly indicates how many tiles Cogmind must travel to get to the nearest [[Surface]] exit.[[/List]]
[[Heading:3]]Unique Interactions[[/Heading]]
Cogmind becomes indistinguishable from a Sigix Warrior to some NPCs. [[Warlord]] will turn aggressive upon seeing Cogmind during the -2 [[Research]] attack or when summoned via Command cave seals. [[MAIN.C]] has unique encounter dialogue and a special phase 2 encounter after the outer shell is defeated, summoning 4 additional [[M Shell/Atk]] and 4 [[M Shell/Def]]s to his side. The [[Architect]] will recognize Cogmind, but also has unique encounter dialogue."

Higher tier Specialists have some the highest damage output of any standard 0b10 bots in the game. Some Specialists also are unique users of [[VSS Leg|VSS Legs]] and its higher rating variants which allow them to walk at a higher speed than most legs (90 vs 120).
Specialists have no specific weaknesses or immunities, so generally any damage type or strategy can work against them. A few have strong cooling and [[Coolant Injectors]] so heat transfer strategies may fall flat against certain Specialists. However, the same cooling parts can also be looted and taken advantage of by Cogmind. Since Specialists are capable of dealing so much damage, they tend to be high priority targets to kill off first.

Some 0b10 squad types can be recalled using a low success rate Recall hack at a [[Terminal]], but all squad types can be located using an Enumerate hack. The numbers of all squad types, although not their compositions or locations, can be revealed with the Enumerate(Squads) hack.
Typically, one bot per squad is designated as the [[Squad Leader]]. Squad leaders are the only bots that have the AI or order type active. All other bots are set to follow the squad leader. If the squad leader is destroyed, the other bots in the squad will either end up wandering around randomly, or leaving the map if their squad leader was already leaving the map.
[[Heading]]Types of 0b10 Squads[[/Heading]]
[[List]][[Assault Squad]] - Dispatched by 0b10 to target Cogmind directly. Unlike most squads that walk to their target, all Assault contents are contained with a faster wheeled [[C-30 ARC]].

"Sterilization","Other","Sterilization is a special [[0b10]] response to Cogmind destroying too many combat bots on a single map. When activated, the ambient heat of the floor will be increased forever until Cogmind exits the map. As the heat increases, any remaining bots, parts on the ground, machines, and traps will all melt. Occasionally, machines will explode before they melt.

[[Garrison|Garrisons]], [[Wastes]], and [[Command]] can not be Sterilized.

Note: Unlike most other maps, in [[Access]] bots are not evacuated. The evacuation-related alerts will not appear and the bots will continue to stay on the map as usual.
[[Heading:2]]Rapid Sterilization[[/Heading]]
DSFs have a unique rapid sterilization system that works much quicker than normal sterilization. Ambient heat increases begin only 20 turns after the initial announcement and occur every 15 turns after that.
[[Heading]]Part Melting[[/Heading]]
After Sterilization is triggered, parts will begin to melt every 30-40 turns and be destroyed instantly. Parts that are 200 integrity or greater are safe from melting. Parts with a lower integrity are more likely to melt than those with higher integrity. For example, [[Treads]] and [[Armor]] tend to last longer or be immune to melting altogether, while fragile processors will melt almost instantly. Parts only melt when within a 20-tile radius around Cogmind, so with a good enough speed, timing, and luck, it is possible to grab parts that would otherwise melt quickly in the heat."
"Storage","Location","Storage is an early game [[0b10]]-controlled [[Branch]] with no unique rewards but plenty of good prototype parts. Storage maps tend to be fairly cramped just like [[Materials]] maps but with fewer patrols and many more [[Y-45 Defender|Sentries]] guarding individual rooms and corridors. There is an unusually high number of [[A-02 Transporter|Haulers]] in these maps. Destroying them for their loot is highly recommended on -9 and -8. On -7 however, many of the Haulers will begin summoning [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcements]] that can cause trouble. The majority of the [[Prototype Part|Prototype Parts]] at this point in the game will be weapons or flight units, so players trying to prepare for a flight transition should consider visiting Storage on -9 or -8. Combat players should also consider Storage as a good way to stock up on early game weaponry. -7 Storage is considered generally inferior to [[Caves]] because Caves has the advantage of [[Alert]] reduction as well as unique branch rewards.
Storage is notable for the large number of prototype parts available. Unique shell and vaults contain many useful early game loot. Vaults can also contain out-of-depth parts. Storage is also notable for the mostly guaranteed [[Garrison (Machine)|Garrison]]. It is the only way to enter a Garrison on -9.

All of the special loot in Storage comes in the form of vaults and shells. The shells will only contain standard floor rating non-prototype and prototype parts. However, some of the vaults contain very out of depth prototype parts. The single item locked vault and the vault full of traps can contain rating 5* prototypes that are far out of depth compared to the normal Storage depths. These vaults can contain great items like [[Cld. Plasma Cannon]], [[Exp. Targeting Computer]], and even a semi-unique part [[Lgt. Regenerative Plating]]. Shells must be broke open by a weapon, while vaults must be hacked open via [[Terminal]]. Some vaults will already be open on entering the map.
[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There are 2 types of exits in Storage:

"Subcaves","Location","Subcaves is an early game [[Branch]] that is guaranteed to appear on -10 every run, with exits being available from [[Materials]] and [[Mines]]. It is a dangerous map, containing a large number of [[Subdweller|Subdwellers]] that will attack Cogmind on sight. A few [[0b10]] patrols may roam the map, engaging wild [[Derelict|Derelicts]].
Unlike most maps, some areas may not be totally accessible in Subcaves without digging. Machinery strewn throughout the map can block passage to important areas. [[Artisan|Artisans]] will grow the machinery even more. Another unique bot presenter, [[Cobbler|Cobblers]], scoop up matter and produce random parts with their [[Cobbler Unit]].
It is easy to be overwhelmed by Subdwellers due to the overall low quality of parts available and relatively low core available on -10. Using Subdweller's weapons against them is recommended due to their high damage output. A [[Scrap Shield]] should always be used if it drops, since it will protect Cogmind's core and other parts well, and is easily repairable in the Subcaves.
[[Heading]]Unique Mechanics[[/Heading]]
One unique mechanic in this map is the ability to uncover new Subdwellers by digging. Be wary of summoning additional foes in this manner when trying to use [[Launchers]]. Any means of destroying terrain can trigger this effect.
Leaving partially damaged parts on the ground will cause ""Subatomizers"" to show up. They are invisible, and will gradually destroy any damaged parts left on the ground for too long.

A collection of 3 broken Subdwellers can found in Subcaves. Sometimes, they will spring to life when Cogmind comes near or attacks. If this happens, one of the Subdwellers will drop one of the 4L-MR0 prototypes. This can allow for a second prototype to be found in a single run.

Trying to pick off 6 Swarmers one by one may take much longer and result in a lot more damage dealt to Cogmind.
Swarmers have a very low memory (20 actions). While they may pursue airborne builds quickly compared to most other bots, it can be easy to lose them after turning the corner in a corridor or hallway near max range. This strategy is more effective when used with [[ECM Suites]].

"Terminal","Other","Terminals are interactable Machines that [[Cogmind]] can hack for various benefits (such as recalling an [[Extermination Squad]]!) and info. Terminals are also often guarded by an [[Operator]], which if alerted will use this terminal to call for a [[Reinforcement Squad]] unless it or the terminal is disabled/destroyed.
The main differences between security levels and terminal types are are :
[[Table]]Security level|Average size|Armor|Direct hacks|Base direct hacking success rate|Base indirect hacking success rate|Base detection rate||
1|Small (1 tile and such)|18|Few available direct hacks|Depends on the hack|-15% compared to direct hacks|20 or 25%||
2|Medium|25|More available direct hacks|Half of level 1, rounded down|-30% compared to direct hacks|50%||
3|Large|30|Lots of available direct hacks|Half of level 2, rounded down|-45% compared to direct hacks|60%, 70% or 80%||
Terminals inside [[Garrison|Garrisons]]|Small (1 tile and such)|18|One of Access(Emergency), Download(Navigation), Download(Registry), or Download(Security)|Same as level 2|Same as level 2|Same as level 2||
Door-type/Lore terminals|Usually 1 tile|18|Usually one direct hack, to open the relevant door or get relevant lore record|Depends on door/lore record|Unavailable|Same as level 1||
Cave outpost terminal|1 tile|18|Random mix of flavor (useless) and intel ""Report"" hacks, with flavor reports always grouped on top of the list and intel reports grouped on the bottom of the list|100%|Unavailable|Same as level 1[[/Table]]
Non-door Garrion terminals are always security level 2, while door-type, lore, and cave outpost terminals are always level 1.

Unauthorized hacking (trojan and force hacks) success rate follows the same logic as direct hacking.

Download(Navigation), Download(Registry), and Download(Security) hacks are only available inside Garrisons.

The frequency of each security level changes by depth. At depth -10, almost all terminals are level 1, while level 3 terminals are extremely rare. As Cogmind ascends through each depth, level 3 terminals become more common, while level 1 terminals become rarer. At depth -1, level 3 terminals are very common, while level 1 terminals are extremely rare.
[[Image]]../game_sprites/Terminal.png|Level 3 terminal![[/Image]]

[[Heading]]Hacking[[/Heading]]
Hacks are listed at [[~/hacks|the Cog-Minder Hacks page]], and explained further in the Cogmind manual.
Common chance factors:
[[List]]
Terminal Security Level - Higher-rated terminals are harder to hack, with direct hacks having half the base success rate they would have on a lower security terminal. Because of this, direct hacks with a negative base success rate will actually have a higher success rate on higher security terminals compared to lower security terminals (half of -8% is -4%).|
Manual Commands - (Security level * -15%) success chance penalty.|
[[Corruption]] - Penalty of -1% per 3% of system corruption to success chance.|
Use penalty - Successfully hacking Alert(Purge), Recall(Investigation), Recall(Reinforcements), Recall(Extermination) or Recall(Assault) permanently reduces the success rate for that specific hack by 10% for the entire map. This penalty is applied for every successful use of the relevant hack, lowering the success rate by 10% every time. The only way to remove it is to leave the map.
[[Hackware]] - Each attached offensive hackware improves success chances by the amount specified in the part description.|
Operator [[Data Core]] - Moving over an Operator's Data Core will automatically collect and it extract its dynamic key, which provides a one-time 1.5x multiplier to the base success rate of all direct hacks, excluding those with a negative base success rate. The dynamic key can only be used before it expires at its Operator's terminal.|
[[Multitool]] - Using a Multitool on a terminal's interactive tile removes all direct hacks and causes tracing to begin immediately, but applies a modifier to indirect hacks.|
[[Operator]] allies - Having allied Operators within 20 tiles provides a +10% bonus to hacks for the first Operator, +5% for the second, +2% for the third, and +1% for all others.|
[[Spoiler]]Botnets trojans - Installing Botnet trojans on other terminals in the same map provides a +6% bonus to hacks for the first botnet installed, +3% for the second, and +1% for all others. Note that a botnet will not affect hacking success chance on the terminal it is installed on.[[/Spoiler]]
[[/List]]

[[Heading]]Detection/Trace[[/Heading]]
[[B]]Warning - This section is lacking in precision and information![[/B]] Please consider contributing to clarify it and/or add information.

Terminals have a varying base detection rate, dependent mostly on their security level. This base detection rate can be lowered through defensive hackware by the amount specified on their part description, and/or [[Spoiler]]permanently lowered by destroying Network Hubs in [[Hub_04(d)]][[/Spoiler]]. However, it can never be lowered below 10%.

Getting detected will cause a trace to start. Each additional hack attempt will cause the trace progress to advance by an amount which can be reduced in the same way as detection rate. Trace advance can never be lowered below 15%. When failing a hack, a catastrophic failure may occur (more likely on higher security terminals), causing the detection rate to go up by far more.

Getting fully traced may result in receiving [[Corruption]], your [[Hackware]] breaking, and will very likely cause an [[Investigation Squad]].

[[Heading]]Central database authorization[[/Heading]]
Indirect hacks for lore records, prototype IDs, part or robot schematics, and robot analyses, are all considered ""database hacks"". Successfully hacking any of them has a base 25% chance to instead cause an area-wide central database lockout, preventing further database hacks. However, direct hacks of those types remain possible after a central database lockout and cannot cause one.

Additionally, not all lore records, parts schematic, robot analyses or robot schematics can be indirectly hacked on all terminals. Terminals have a level of database authorization dependent on security level and current depth, equal to (10 - current depth + security level). It is only possible to indirectly hack a part/robot schematic or analysis if the terminal's authorization level is equal to or higher than the rating/tier of the relevant part/robot (prototype parts are considered to have a +1 to their rating for this purpose).
For example, at depth -5, level 2 terminals have an authorization level of (10 - 5 + 2) = 7.
Lore records also have a rating/tier, but it isn't communicated in-game. 

[[Heading]]Direct hacking subtleties[[/Heading]]
There are many small subtleties to direct hacking. Here is an incomplete list:
[[List]]
[[GameText]][Local Emergency Access][[/GameText]], [[GameText]][Purge Alert][[/GameText]] and all [[GameText]][Traps][[/GameText]] hacks appear greyed out in direct hacks if they are currently useless. In other words, if a terminal has a greyed out direct [[GameText]][Locate Traps][[/GameText]] hack, then there are no traps within the terminal's range.|
If either [[GameText]][Disarm Traps][[/GameText]] or [[GameText]][Reprogram Traps][[/GameText]] is available as a direct hack, then [[GameText]][Locate Traps][[/GameText]] will also be a direct hack on that terminal.|
If [[GameText]][Purge Alert][[/GameText]] is available as a direct hack, then [[GameText]][Check Alert][[/GameText]] will also be a direct hack on that terminal.|
If there is a direct [[GameText]][Recall][[/GameText]] hack available, then the corresponding [[GameText]][Status][[/GameText]] hack will also be available on that terminal.|

"Testing","Location","Testing is a [[0b10]]-controlled [[Branch]] off of [[Research]] that appears on either -3 or -2. It is always on the floor that [[Quarantine]] is not on. Testing is a much smaller and generally much more manageable map compared to normal Research floors. There are few patrols, no [[Sentry]] or [[Heavy]] guards, and only a few special mini guard areas that can usually be easily avoided. There are unique [[Researcher]] bots that show up on this map that have dangerous effects when getting scanned. There are also powerful special and unique items that are not obtainable anywhere else. Even among normal parts, there is a much higher than usual chance of finding [[Prototype Part|Prototype Parts]] on the ground. Like all Research branches, [[Farcom]] will trigger [[Maximum Security]] upon entry.
Testing is home to the [[SGEMP Prototype]] that [[Zhirov]] asks for when you see him in his [[Zhirov (Location)|lab]]. It is guarded by 2 [[Striker|Strikers]] and an [[Alpha 7]]. The SGEMP always spawns in the vertically opposite corner of the map that Cogmind first spawns on. For example, if Cogmind would spawn in the top-left section of the map, the SGEMP would be in the bottom left. With the [[Phasing AFG]] and [[Portable AFG]], it is possible to retrieve the SGEMP without getting spotted at all. Otherwise the primary methods of obtaining are fighting the bots head-on or grabbing it and making a run for it.
[[Heading]]Getting Scanned[[/Heading]]
Attacking when in visual range of a Researcher or attacking a Researcher will result in them turning yellow and attempting to stasis and scan any hostiles. Whenever any bot is caught in stasis, the Researcher will summon a [[Reinforcement Squad]] to its current position. If Cogmind is scanned, it will also result in [[Q-Series]] being summoned instead of [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]]. These Q-Series have custom loadout that depends on Cogmind's current build.
Typically getting scanned is seen as a negative due to the high power level of Q-Series. Some builds might intentionally want to get scanned in order to get the Q-Series loot. To avoid unintentionally scanning, detach any ranged weapons whenever a Researcher is in line of sight of Cogmind. Melee weapons, special weapons like [[Datajacks]], and any type of guided weapon are safe to keep equipped to avoid misfires due to [[Corruption]].

[[Heading:2]][[Protovariant|Protovariants]][[/Heading]]
There can be up to 2 Protovariants on a Testing map. These are prototype superpowered versions of different bot classes that have a very strong loadout of high rating prototype parts. They are fearsome foes with high damage output and are quite difficult to take down compared to most bots but have incredible loot. They can spawn in one of 4 states: Unpowered, Dormant, Active, or Disabled/rewirable. Protovariants can be of the following types:
[[List]][[Protovariant D]]: Demolisher|[[Protovariant G]]: Grunt|[[Protovariant H]]: Hunter|[[Protovariant L]] Duelist|[[Protovariant P]]: Programmer|[[Protovariant X]]: Specialist|[[Protovariant Y]]: Sentry[[/List]]
In Testing there is a special hack that can appear on [[Terminal|Terminals]]: [[GameText]]Control(Protovariants)[[/GameText]]. If successfully performed, it will turn a Protovariant on the map hostile to everything. The Protovariant can make quite a mess of 0b10 bots, but may cause more trouble than it's worth. Researchers will report the bot repeatedly when they see it attack. There is a special assault [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] that gets dispatched to the Protovariant's location when this hack is performed. This ARC contains an [[Investigator]] inside that will scan Cogmind even without being provoked. Sometimes a Protovariant will enter the out of control state even if Cogmind does not perform the [[GameText]]Control(Protovariants)[[/GameText]] hack.
[[Heading:2]]Testing Shells[[/Heading]]
The majority of unique Testing items appear in Reinforced Shells. There are no identifying features that indicate the contents of these Shells. The list of unique Testing items contained within are:
[[List]][[2N-1CE's Frost Array]]|[[AEGIS Remote Shield]]|[[Cld. Nova Cannon]]|[[Disintegrator]]|[[Exp. Hardlight Generator]]|[[Ghost Barrier]]|[[Hpw. Disruptor Cannon]]|[[Hvy. Quantum Rifle]]|[[Hyp.

Multirail]]|[[Myomer Exoskeleton]]|[[Null Cannon]]|[[Omega Cannon]]|[[Perforator]]|[[Portable AFG]]|[[System Mapper]]|[[Tachyon Dispersion Ray]]|[[Warp Gun]]|[[Z-bomb Delivery System]][[/List]]
There are 2 unique prefabs that do not contain any of the above items and have their own list. One prefab has 1-2 [[Potential Cannon|Potential Cannons]] or [[Imp. Potential Cannon|Imp. Potential Cannons]] (not necessarily the same type) and several [[Imp. Energy Well|Imp]], [[Adv. Energy Well|Adv.]], or [[Exp. Energy Well|Exp. Energy Wells]]. The other shell is locked behind Sealed Heavy Doors and has a special Researcher behind. The Terminal can be hacked to open the doors, but the Researcher will make it difficult to break the Shell without getting scanned. However, penetrating the heavy doors first will allow safely killing the Researcher. It is also possible to dig in to the back of the prefab directly into the Shell area. The shell will always contain [[SHELL Armor]] and 3 random pieces of [[Lgt. Regenerative Plating]], [[Med. Regenerative Plating]], or [[Hvy. Regenerative Plating]]. The Terminal on the inside of the shell contains schematic for some of the regenerative platings.
[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There is always 1, and possibly 2 exits in Testing:
[[List]]Main access exit: There will always be 1 exit that leads to the next main Research or [[Access]] floor. It will always be at a dead end at a tile corridor near the top-middle or bottom-middle of the map.|[[Redacted]][[Section 7]] exit: This exit only appears some of the time. [[Quarantine]] must have been first on the world map, so this exit can only show up when Testing is on -2. A large 4 tile doorway will show up on the middle of the map, on the right side of where the map typically ends. It will open up into a 6 tile hallway and a [[Fortress]] will be guarding the path to the exit.[[/Redacted]][[/List]]"

[[Heading:2]]Behavior[[/Heading]]
Thieves dash towards the closest visible enemy robot and try to steal one of that robot's parts using their [[Tearclaws]]. If successful, the Thief will flee, carrying the stolen part in their inventory. If a Thief in the process of fleeing is or goes outside Cogmind's field of view, they will exit the map.

When trying to steal parts, Thieves will prioritize attacking robots that they can see over those they track but can't currently see, and will always attack enemy robots that are within range.

[[Heading:2]]Strategies[[/Heading]]
Thieves are incapable of taking parts on the ground, so dropping important parts you don't want to lose keeps them safe from them. However, this strategy can backfire if there are [[Dirty Bomb Trap|Dirty Bomb Traps]] or [[Decomposer|Decomposer]] nearby, or if Cogmind or other robots carry  [[Launchers]] or [[Electromagnetic Weapons]] capable of triggering chain reactions in power sources.

Because of how Thieves prioritize targets, moving out of sight can make them attack other robots if you know there are other within the Thieves' sight. Moving behind allies or swapping with them to place them closer to the Thieves can also prevent your own parts getting stolen.

In order to actually destroy Thieves, Launchers can work well when aimed at walls next to the Thieves, though at close range the collateral damage might not be worth it. Targeting utilities can help actually hit them while they are approaching, and a Stasis Beam/Projector can prevent a single Thief from attacking or escaping while also making them easier to hit, at the cost of making them take 50% less damage.

[[Blade Trap|Blade Traps]], [[Segregator Trap|Segregator Traps]] and [[Stasis Trap|Stasis Traps]] can work well in disarming or stopping Thieves, provided you have enough time to place them, for example before attacking a Thief ambush.

If Cogmind is fast enough, fleeing is also an option, for example to lead the Thieves into 0b10 robots, [[Warlord]]-aligned derelicts or traps.

"Traps","Part Group","Traps are most often found in groups called arrays, and appear in a variety of layouts including rows, blocks or sparser ""minefields"". They are, however, usually triggered individually.
[[Heading]]Triggering[[/Heading]]
Moving over a trap does not always trigger it. The chance is instead determined by the form of [[Propulsion]]:
[[Table]]
Mode|Probability
|| Overweight | 100%
|| [[Treads]] | 100%
|| [[Legs]] | 75%
|| [[Wheels]] | 50%
|| [[Hover Units|Hover]]/Core | 40%
|| [[Flight Units|Flight]] | 20%
[[/Table]]
Once triggered, the trap at that position is spent and will not trigger again. (Some traps exhibit special behavior in this regard.)
Note there are also multiple undocumented circumstances under which a trap may be triggered, not simply regular movement. Also, [[Stasis Trap]]s are a special case and their chance to trigger is the opposite of the values listed above (Flight ex: 100 - 20 = 80%).
Cogmind has a 1% chance to detect each trap in view, checked every turn, where each active [[Structural Scanner]] provides a +2% bonus. Hack terminals to reveal entire trap arrays at once. Nearby allied [[Operator]]s will also reveal hidden traps within your field of vision, and local trap locations can also be extracted from an operator [[Data Core]].
[[Heading]]Removal[[/Heading]]
The simplest way to remove one or more traps is to destroy the section of floor housing it. Arrays of traps can be permanently disarmed via terminal hacking, and disabling traps on an individual basis is a possible side effect of hacking one with an active melee [[Datajacks|datajack]].
[[Heading]]Collection[[/Heading]]
An enterprising Cogmind can, with the use of a [[Trap Extractor]] or similar variant, pick up the various traps scattered throughout [[0b10|Complex 0b10]] for their own use.
[[Heading]]Reprogramming[[/Heading]]
By default traps are programmed to trigger on detection of any foreign robot, a setting that can be modified via hacking. Known traps may be reprogrammed with an active melee datajack by bumping them, and entire arrays of traps can be reprogrammed at once from nearby terminals. Reprogrammed traps will no longer recognize Cogmind or allies as a threat, instead reacting to local combat robots. As part of the new programming, each trap's sensitivity will also be set dangerously high, ensuring it will trigger whenever a hostile moves over it, regardless of propulsion.

More announcements will show up, but the next most important one will be [[GameText]]Warlord currently on norther/central/southern western approach. All units hit designated targets[[/GameText]] which indicates where Warlord and [[God Mode]] will appear on the map. 50 turns after entering the map, another announcement [[GameText]]Trap arrays successfully disabled[[/GameText]] will come with all traps being removed from the map. 110 after entering the maps, [[GameText]]Machine network successfully disabled[[/GameText]] will indicate that every machine on the map is now shut down except for [[Garrison (Machine)|Garrisons]] due to the follow-up message [[GameText]]Unrecognized interference restored Garrison access controls.

Every 100 turns 1 Derelict squad will spawn on the left side of the map for each tunnel. After 1000 turns on the map, Warlord will tell Cogmind that it is time to retreat and to open the [[Redacted]]Cave Seals in [[Command]] for the final push.[[/Redacted]]
[[Heading:2]]Downside of event[[/Heading]]
As a result of the Warlord assault, additional patrols will be dispatched in [[Testing]], [[Quarantine]], and [[Access]]. Patrols will increase by 40% in these maps. This is most significant in Access, upping the Patrol count from 20 to 28. A few Warlord bots will also appear at the entrance to these maps.
[[Image]]Research Warlord Squads.png|A few Derelict squads[[/Image]]
[[Heading]]Derelict Forces[[/Heading]]
The Derelict forces consist of many unique bots during this event. All of them appear as non-controllable allies that do not generate any alert for Cogmind. There are 3 spawn points in the form of giant tunnels. Each tunnel is dug out by a [[Borebot]] escorted by 2 [[Samaritan|Samaritans]]. They will dig straight across the map to the right side. Tiles that are dug out by Borebots are safe to travel on and will not cave-in. Warlord attack squads can vary greatly in composition but are made up of the following bots:
[[List]][[Butcher (7)|Butchers]]|[[Commander|Commanders]]|[[Dragon|Dragons]]|[[Fireman (7)|Firemen]]|[[Guerrilla (7)|Guerrillas]]|[[Hydra|Hydras]]|[[Knight]]|[[Marauder (8)|Marauders]]|[[Martyr (7)|Martyrs]]|[[Savage (7)|Savages]]|[[Thug (7)|Thugs]]|[[Troll|Trolls]]|[[Wasp (7)|Wasps]]|[[Wizard (7)|Wizards]][[/List]]
[[Image]]Research Warlord Assault Squads.png|0b10 Warlord response assault squad[[/Image]]The 0b10 forces come in groups of 3 bots. There are always 2 (not necessarily of the same type) of [[Executioner]], [[Striker]], and [[D-83 Annihilator]] bots along with a [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] full of bots. They roam around the map looking for bots to fight.
[[Heading:2]][[DD-05H]][[/Heading]]
Sometimes DD-05H will appear a few hundred turns into the invasion. It will run toward Warlord and then follow Warlord around for the duration of the event. When this happens, the [[Tinkerer]] PL-HR7 will also appear at one of the invasion entrances on the left side of the map. PL-HR7 will drop a [[Warlord Statue]] that Cogmind can use.
[[Heading]]Encrypted Comm Array[[/Heading]]
If Cogmind has aided Warlord forces by compromising Garrisons and DSFs, Cogmind may get 1 or 2 additional special escort squads based on the force multiplier. These special squads will head straight to Cogmind's location and follow. The higher the force multiplier, the stronger the squads available for escort. The special squads are as follows:
[[List]]Bridgeowners Association: Trolls|Cat Herders: Wasps|Death Star: Martyrs|Department No. 42: Firemen|Offensive Angels: Wasps|Golden Rifles: Commanders, Geurrillas, Surgeons, and Thugs|Grunt Murderers: Thugs|Gunslingers: Guerrillas|Lair Dwellers: Hydras|Lobotomizers: Wizards|Lucky Slug: Marauders|Magnificent Bastards: Mutants|Metalheads: Mutants|Knights of the Pentagonal Table: Knights|Railsplitters: Guerrillas|Shockpunchers: Wizards|Smaug Morners: Dragons|The Professionals: Commanders, Guerrillas, Knights, Surgeons, Trolls, and Wizards|Vikings: Butchers|Viscera Detail: Butchers and Savages[[/List]]
This event tends to be great for Cogmind. The primary downsides is that the machine network turns off relatively early into the event and locating the desired exit can be a pain. Getting stuck in a bad position without any Derelict allies can also be painful since the assaults, particularly the prototype bots and demolishers, pack quite a punch. However, the large number of alert-free allies and free loot from the bots fighting is great to any build. Like the Revision 17 event, this event will also cause the maps to have no Heavies. Finding any exit is usually possible by following the assault dispatch notifications. Assaults will be dispatched out of any Garrison or exit. The only exits that assaults do not come from are Quarantine prefab exits. In that case, using other infowar like terrain scanning and drones is the best way to locate these exits."

There are a few [[Dirty Bomb Trap|Dirty Bomb Traps]] spread around this section of the map, so be prepared if Cogmind has any [[Corruption]]. There are two entrances into the base: The first has some doors blocking a large corruption-cleansing System Quarantine Field Array, some opened Blast Doors, and a second set of regular doors opening up into 2 [[Marauder (6)|Marauders]]. This entrance has a large number of [[Fire Trap|Fire Traps]] installed. The second way in is either on the top or the bottom of the map, hidden behind some fake walls. These will automatically open if approached from the inside of the base. Behind these fake walls are a set of Sealed Heavy Doors, followed by one more set of fake walls. If Cogmind is [[RIF]] aligned, they will be detected and the entire base will be turned hostile. This occurs no matter which entrance is taken. It is safe to get the corruption cleanse, but any further will be dangerous.
The interior of the base is different every run. There are always 2 guaranteed rooms in every run. The first is the Vortex Lab which is locked behind Sealed Heavy Doors with a [[Terminal]] to open it next to them. Inside are some [[Tinkerer|Tinkerers]], a lore Terminal, and a random assortment of Vortex weaponry. There will always be at least one pair of weapons from the following list:
[[List]][[Vortex Cannon]]|[[Vortex Driver]]|[[Vortex Lance]]|[[Vortex Rail]]|[[Vortex Rifle]]|[[Vortex Shotgun]][[/List]]
There may also be a single [[Vortex Catalyst Activator]], and if this is a seed where the [[Exiles (Group)|Exiles]] abandoned their hideout, [[EX-DEC]] will be present along with a [[BFG-9k Vortex Edition]]. The other guaranteed room is Warlord's throne room. In it are Warlord himself, 6 [[Thug (7)|Thugs]], 2 [[Knight|Knights]], [[God Mode (Fake)|Fake God Mode]], and Warlord's stash. The stash is locked by Sealed Heavy Doors. The Terminal can be hacked open with a special code obtained at a Terminal in [[Data Miner (Location)]].
The contents of Warlord's stash will vary every game with only the Vortex Chain Reactor being guaranteed. The contents can be as follows:
[[List]](guaranteed) [[Vortex Chain Reactor]]|[[Adv. Remote Shield]] or [[Imp. Energy Mantle]]|[[Exp. Phase Shifter]], [[Exp. Targeting Computer]], or [[Exp. Cloaking Device]]|1-2 of one of [[Electron Diverter]], [[Imp. Diametric Drive]], or [[Cld. Impulse Thruster]]|1-2 of one of [[Exp. Myomer Leg]] or [[Enh. Biometal Leg]]|1-2 of one of [[Cld. Antigrav System]]|[[System Mapper]] or [[Ghost Barrier]]|[[Exp. Energy Well]], [[Exp. Matter Compressor]], [[Exp. Cooling System]], [[Exp. Coolant Injector]], or [[Adv. Cryofiber Web]]|[[Spectral Analyzer]], [[Exp. Target Analyzer]], [[Exp. Core Analyzer]], or [[Exp. Armor Integrity Analyzer]]|[[Thermal Barrier]], [[Exp. Focal Shield]], or [[System Purifier]][[/List]]
[[Heading]]Alignment - [[Warlord (Alignment)|Warlord]][[/Heading]]
After entering Warlord's throne room, he will explain his plan to attack upper 0b10. As long as he survives until Cogmind exits the map and the 0b10 forces attack, he will attack on -2 [[Research]]. This will occur even if you turn the Warlord forces hostile before exiting the map. Keep in mind, it is possible for a fast Flight build to leave before the assault begins which will prevent the invasion. Along with this Research event, there is another event in [[Command]] that this affects: [[Redacted]]When the Command cave seals are opened, [[Warlord (Command)]] will pop out along with various other Warlord-aligned Derelicts.[[/Redacted]] This alignment is incompatible with RIF or attacking [[Scraptown]] as Warlord will be hostile when entering the base. It is also incompatible with [[Imprint]] or [[UFD]] alignment, as Warlord will not be happy talking with Cogmind. If the [[Encrypted Comm Array]] has been obtained, Warlord will thank Cogmind for assisting his forces. At this point, no more forces will be summonable and the Array can be dropped.

[[Heading]]0b10 Assault[[/Heading]]
There are several conditions that can kick off the 0b10 assault on Warlord's base:
[[List]]Moving 575 tiles|Being on the map for 1300 turns|Visiting Warlord in his throne room|Opening up the Vortex Lab[[/List]]
After any of these conditions is met, large groups of 0b10 forces will come from an opening in either the top-right, middle-right, or bottom-right section of the map. These bots roam around the map randomly in groups, but usually come straight through the main entrance. When this happens, a large group of [[Bouncer|Bouncers]] will join the existing Marauder guards at the front gate. The first wave will usually be decimated by the entryway traps, but many more will follow.
There are a total of 14 assault waves, although it is highly recommended to leave the map before that many enemy bots appear. 10 turns after the first [[GameText]]MAIN.C incursion imminent. Mobilizing sentries[[/GameText]] announcement, the first wave will appear with the announcement [[GameText]]Northeast/Southeast/Central east cave walls breached[[/GameText]] indicating where the spawn location is. From then on, waves will spawn in 100 turn increments. Every 90 turns will give a [[GameText]]MAIN.C reinforcements approaching through caves, arriving soon[[/GameText]] announcement, and 10 turns after that the waves will spawn with an announcement of the wave composition. 4 squads can spawn per wave.
[[Image]]Warlord Assault Wave.png|A typical assault wave. Pictured are Saboteur, Hunter, Melee, and Grunt squads with Prototype support[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]]Assault Contents[[/Heading]]
The hostile forces are made up of different types of squads, each with their own squad leader:
[[List]]Behemoth Squad: [[Behemoth|Behemoths]]|Demolisher Squad: [[Demolisher|Demolishers]] with a [[Protector]]|Grunt Squad: [[Grunt|Grunts]], sometimes with a [[Specialist]] squad leader or [[Protector]] support|Hunter Squad: [[Hunter|Hunters]] and [[Swarmer|Swarmers]]|Melee Squad: [[Duelist|Duelists]], [[Brawler|Brawlers]] with a [[Protector]]|Mixed Squad: [[Grunt|Grunts]], [[Duelist|Duelists]], [[Brawler|Brawlers]], and [[Mechanic|Mechanics]]|Programmer Squad: [[Programmer|Programmers]]|Saboteur Squad: [[E-15 Imp|Imps]] and [[Grunt|Grunts]]|Swarmer Squad: [[Swarmer|Swarmers]][[/List]]
Sometimes these squads can spawn with ""Prototype Support"". When this happens, [[Executioner]] and [[Striker]] bots can also appear as part of a squad.
[[Heading:2]]Assisting[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Warlord Wall Lure.png|Luring hostiles around the wall[[/Image]]Staying and fighting near the main entryway is one of the best approaches to fighting the waves off. Join in with [[Launchers]] if you have them, but make sure to watch out for friendly fire. There is a bit of leeway, but hitting allies too many times will be considered a betrayal. Demolishers and Programmers are the highest priority targets since they can cause a lot of damage with Launchers and robot hacking respectively. Throwing Claymores and the Vortex Catalyst Activator that can both be obtained on this map are great options to destroy waves with ease. [[Visual Processing Units]] coupled with long ranged weapons are another good option to sit back and snipe bots from outside their typical range. The entrance defense is quite strong and will perform well most of the time. However, a squad of Programmers with an unlucky chain-assimilation of bots or some unchecked Demolishers will quickly tear any defense to pieces.
Even a build with little offensive power can help out in this part of the defense. Getting spotted first will cause hostiles to prioritize Cogmind for a while, even if they are getting shot by something else. This means that the Warlord bots can blast away all the hostiles while they are trying to run after you. This can work well for combat builds too, especially for combat hostiles without launchers of their own.
[[Heading:2]]Counterattack[[/Heading]]
In between the 4th and 5th waves, a Derelict will appear next to Cogmind to leave the base with the counterattack for cover. At this point, the majority of the combat Derelicts except for the guard Marauders and Bouncers will begin to head outside of the base. The strength of the counterattacks depends on a lot of factors. If the defense falters early on, the counterattack can get caught up fighting a bunch of squads and never make it out the entrance. Their tendency to trickle to the fight can be a big weakness if the hostiles are bunched up and can quickly take out Derelicts one at a time. On the other hand, [[Sapper|Sappers]] will dramatically increase the strength of any counterattack and can destroy big groups of bots on their own. 
The counterattack is usually a good time to exit the map whether it's successful or not. For airborne builds especially, even if the counterattack dies early on it can serve as a good distraction as you fly by.
[[Heading:2]]Base Infiltration[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Warlord Enhanced Allies.png|Enhanced Allies[[/Image]]In between the 7th and 8th assault waves is the final event of the map. A random spot in the Warlord base will be infiltrated and hostile assault squads will begin to appear from that location too with the announcement [[GameText]]Base interior infiltrated, regroup at designated outer cave rendezvous points[[/GameText]]. At the same time, a friendly group of 3 [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]] and 3 [[Enhanced Demolisher|Enhanced Demolishers]] will teleport into Warlord's throne room to assist. 2 of the Demolishers will immediately head toward the exit while the remaining bots follow Warlord around. At this point, all surviving Derelicts will head toward Warlord as he makes his way over to the map exit.
This is the last chance to exit the map with any amount of assistance. With assaults pouring in from the main entrance and a spot in the base itself, it is time to go. The Enhanced Demolishers have incredible loot including [[Cmb. Linear Gravjet|Cmb. Linear Gravjets]], [[Centrium Medium Armor Plating]], [[Coolant Network]], and the unique [[Chain Missile Launcher]]."

"Wasp (5)","Bot",""
"Wasp (7)","Bot",""
"Wastes","Location","Wastes is a [[0b10]]-controlled sub-floor in Factory that appears on most floors between -7 and -4. It can only be entered when Cogmind triggers a [[Chute Trap]]. Cogmind will get dropped in instantly, and any nearby allies or bots who have previously triggered a chute trap will also appear over time. Wastes can be a very brutal map for an unprepared player. There are 6 hostile [[C-40 Crusher|Crushers]] that can decimate Cogmind's build in a few hits. There is an EMP that is on in some Wastes maps that fires every 100 turns and adds between 5 to 10% [[Corruption]] to Cogmind. This corruption can be reduced by EM [[Resistance Devices]] and [[Dynamic Insulation Systems]]. There are various broken, faulty, or otherwise low integrity parts scattered on the ground. These parts can be several ratings out of depth and can be good to try to repair or scan and fabricate.
The layout of this map is semi-fixed. The entrance, exits, and general layouts of the map are similar, although the exact layout can vary a bit in which way paths are connected. There are wide 4 tile corridors that sometimes have 8 by 8 tile wide dead ends on the far ends of the map. Cogmind spawns on the left side, and the exit will always be in an 8 by 8 tile section on the right side of the map.

[[Heading]]Variations[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Wastes Allies.png|[[Derelict|Derelicts]] hiding in the walls waiting to attack[[/Image]][[Image]]Wastes Allies Waiting.png|Allies that invaded chutes waiting for Cogmind[[/Image]]
There are 4 primary variations of Wastes:
[[List]]Standard: The EMP is on, Crushers are present, and there are no allies.|EMP + allies: The EMP is on, Crushers are present, and there are Derelict allies hiding in the walls. The Derelicts will burst out of their hiding spot when coming near them. There is a small stash of weapons and armor in their hiding spot.|No EMP + allies: The EMP is disabled, Crushers are present, and there are Derelict allies hiding in the walls.|No EMP + raided: The EMP is disabled but there are no alive Crushers or Derelicts on the map. Some damaged Crusher loot and broken Crushers and Derelicts are present. Broken crushers may suddenly reactivate if Cogmind gets too close.|No EMP + raided + allies: The EMP is disabled, there are no alive Crushers, but there is a group of Derelicts waiting for Cogmind.[[/List]]
[[Heading]]Strategy[[/Heading]]
If Cogmind is airborne the strategy is usually pretty simple. Either try to search the big map endings where the Derelict allies spawn from or make a beeline for the exit on the right of the map. The Derelicts will usually take out most of the Crushers without any assistance.If trying to fly by, the Crushers do not have the most intelligent movement and can often be juked by luring them to one side of a corridor and then crossing by the other side out of reach. Circling back may be needed to avoid groups of Crushers. If the EMP is off, Cogmind might be able to kite the Crushers indefinitely in order to shoot them to death with any ranged weapon. Otherwise, the best bet is usually to head straight for the exit to avoid getting too much corruption.
Dealing with Crushers on combat is typically a much more daunting task. Crushers are slow moving, but incredibly tanky and difficult to kill through conventional means. One good strategy to kill them are critical destroy weapons such as a [[8R-AWN's Boregun]], [[Hyp. Gauss Rifle]], or [[Hyp. Gauss Cannon]]. While the armor can't be crit, the core and compactor exposure are about 23% together, and getting a critical hit on either one is as good as a kill. To avoid corruption when the EMP is on, put on a [[Damper Plating]] as soon as possible after killing a Crusher. Getting an early crit can result in some very high integrity Damper Plating drops. Another strategy is a meltdown build. 3 or more thermal guns can overheat the Crushers and cause them to melt.
[[Image]]Wastes Crusher Lure.png|Crusher loop strategy[[/Image]]Fighting Crushers head on without enough firepower can usually result in Cogmind losing their build. One way to hedge your bets is to lure the Crushers in a circle around the starting corner of the map. You can shoot the Crusher around the walls and through a tunnel you create. See the image on the right as a reference. The Crushers is forced to take the long path around while you can take the short path. This technique is a little risky as it is possible to get totally surrounded by multiple Crushers.
Sometimes the best option is simply to detach all parts and make a run for it. If the EMP is off, dropping parts in the corner of the map preemptively is a good idea. If the Derelict allies are on the map, they can clear out most of the Crushers for you so you can go back and pick up your parts later. Even if there are no allies around, being able to pick the parts that you want to take is a lot better than having all your parts crushed and being stuck with only junk.
Using [[RIF]] along with a [[Datajacks|Datajack]] and [[Relay Coupler [NC]|NC Couplers]] makes each Crusher neutral for 3 charges a pieces. This makes the Crushers trivial to loot for maximum salvage, although the EMP can still make the process be quite annoying. Ramming these bots when neutralized this way is safe to do if running low on matter."
"Watcher","Bot Group","Watchers are [[Hover Units|hovering]] [[0b10]] non-combat bots that report hostiles upon visual contact to other allied bots. Watchers have a large distress signal area of effect compared to other bots. If Cogmind has a Watcher in line of sight then an animation will play when the Watcher alerts other bots. Combat bots and [[Operator|Operators]] will all be alerted to your location when this happens, after which combat bots will pursue and Operators will attempt to report hostiles at their [[Terminal]]. Watchers have [[Visual Processing Units]] that allow them to see bots at a larger range than the usual 16 tile range of vision. Watchers also have a unique [[Sensor Arrays|Sensor]] jamming effect while Cogmind is within a certain distance of them. Watchers possess a large number of desirable parts, including their Visual Processing Units, Sensor Arrays, and [[Signal Interpreters]].
Watchers are arguably the most troublesome non-combat bot class in the game. Their large visual range, large reporting range, and sensor jamming abilities cause a wide variety of problems for many different build types. The most effective tool against them are [[Transmission Jammers]] which will block their reporting ability. While a Watcher is jammed, it is possible to tell if bots are nearby. If there are no bots nearby, nothing will happen when the Watcher is in range. However, if there are bots nearby, there will be a constant game log message of [[GameText]][Watcher type] distress signal jammed.[[/GameText]]
Watchers are quite difficult to kill, especially the W-44 Eye variant. Their naturally higher than usual avoidance and propensity for running away makes them hard to hit, and a Watcher that lives to run away is a Watcher that continues to summon more trouble from far away. For airborne builds, [[Impact Weapons]] are good at killing Watchers due to their high number of low integrity utilities and massive weakness fo EM damage. For grounded builds, many EM weapons can kill a Watcher in one or two hits, especially with the high amount of corruption gained. To obtain salvage, kinetic guns or non-impact melee weapons are one of the most reliable ways to kill Watchers in a salvage neutral way.

Aligning with [[Zhirov]] is a minor [[Alignment|alignment]] that can be started in [[Zhirov (Location)|Zhirov's Lab]]. After entering and exiting the Terminal room on the left side of the map, Zhirov will ask Cogmind to steal the [[SGEMP Prototype]] from [[Testing]] and bring it to [[Access]]. If this is done, Zhirov, Perun, and Svarog will show up in Access and give Cogmind full map intel. They will follow Cogmind but will all teleport out if Zhirov falls below roughly half core integrity. They also leave if Cogmind enters [[Command]]. If a [[Core Reset Matrix]] is used prior to Access but Cogmind still carries the SGEMP, Zhirov and his allies will turn hostile and fight Cogmind to the death

Zhirov will activate the Modified SGEMP and disable all 0b10-aligned bots on the map. This also affects [[Warlord (Command)]], but no other Derelicts. This does stop Cogmind from getting the score bonuses of defeating [[MAIN.C]], as well as the + on the scoresheet.[[/Redacted]]"
"Zhirov (Location)","Location","Zhirov is a [[Caves]] [[Branch]] that appears on -5 or -4 and is home to the eponymous bot [[Zhirov]]. This is a safe map with no hostile spawns and only friendly bots, although Cogmind should be wary of [[Corruption]] triggering misfires that anger Zhirov. Detaching all ranged weapons is advised.
This map initially appears to be a small section of caves with only an exit. Approaching the left wall will cause the cave walls to slide away to reveal some Cloak Generators and some larger Sealed Heavy Doors blocking the way. These Cloak Generators surround the entire outside of Zhirov's lab. Continuing to the left will cause the doors to slide down and reveal Zhirov himself who will greet you. [[Perun]] and [[Svarog]] guard just above and below the entrance on the left side.
There are a large collection of [[Terminal|Terminals]] to the left of Zhirov. The first terminal going counterclockwise contains some lore records and the depths of, [[Quarantine]], [[Testing]], and [[Command]]. The second contains Analyses for [[Q-Series]], [[Striker|Strikers]], [[Executioner|Executioners]], and [[Alpha 7|Alpha 7s]]. The third contains 4 Prototype ID Banks. The fourth contains Schematics for an [[Assault Drone Bay]], [[Exp. Heat Sink]], [[Exp. Optical Array]], and [[Imp. Arc Thrower]]. This is the only way that Assault Drone Bays can be obtained. In the room just below this, there is a series of 3 Terminals that describe Zhirov's past since arriving on Tau Ceti IV.
Near the center area there are two [[Alien Artifact|Alien Artifacts]] with explanatory Terminals. The left will either be an [[Integrated Reactor]] or an [[Integrated Dissipator]]. The right will always be a [[Transdimensional Reconstructor]].
At the bottom of the map are some broken bots and an assorted collection of parts. None of these parts are guaranteed, although there will always be some available. The list of available parts is as follows:
[[List]][[Adv. Myomer Leg]], [[Cld. Gravmag System]], or [[Cld. Nuclear Pulse Thruster]]|[[Fusion Reactor]] or [[Hvy. Antimatter Reactor]]|[[Adv. Energy Well]], or [[Adv. Power Amplifier]]|[[Exp.

[[Image]]Zhirov Explosion.gif|Zhirov leaving with flair[[/Image]]
Unlike the Cloak Generators in [[Zion]], these machines are the real deal. If destroyed, there are some major consequences that follow. Zhirov and friends will immediately turn aggressive and begin to attack. A large group of friendly [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]] wil teleport in and start attacking Zhirov. Zhirov will attempt to teleport out when his core integrity gets to about half. He will first say [[GameText]]Looks like we have to say goodbye to this place, and you[[/GameText]]. This will rig a large number of explosions to go off in about 10 turns. This happens even if the Cloak Generators are already intact and Zhirov is attacked.
[[Heading]][[Zhirov (Alignment)|Alignment - Zhirov]][[/Heading]][[Image]]Testing SGEMP.png|The SGEMP room in Testing[[/Image]]
After entering and exiting the Terminal room, Zhirov will ask Cogmind to steal the [[SGEMP Prototype]] from Testing and bring it to [[Access]]. If done, Zhirov, Perun, and Svarog will show up in Access and will give Cogmind perfect map intel and follow until Zhirov falls below half core integrity. If a [[Core Reset Matrix]] is used prior to Access but Cogmind still carries the SGEMP, Zhirov and his allies will turn hostile and fight Cogmind to the death instead.
There is a second part of this quest that continues in [[Command]]. [[Redacted]]After destroying the first form of [[MAIN.C (Shell)|MAIN.C]] in Command, Zhirov, Perun, and Svarog will show up and Zhirov will activate the Modified SGEMP and disable all 0b10-aligned bots on the map.[[/Redacted]]
[[Heading]]Fighting[[/Heading]]
Fighting Zhirov and gaining anything from the encounter is not an easy task. Although he has some nice loot, his tendency to teleport out at the slightest hint of danger and explosive aftermath even on a successful kill is very frustrating to deal with. One option is to loot Perun and Svarog while ignoring Zhirov and simply exiting the map safely. These 2 can still have some good parts, although they have nothing as lucrative as Zhirov with the guaranteed inventory drops of [[Deep Network Scanner]], [[Quantum Router]], a [[Transdimensional Reconstructor]], and a [[Zhirov Special]]. Only Zhirov can set off the traps and cause the group to leave.
The best way to safely grab all the loot is with [[Master Tearclaws]] that can be looted from [[Master Thief|Master Thieves]]. These Tearclaws can strip all 3 bots of their parts with little risk of explosives. Just make sure Zhirov doesn't fall below 80 core integrity. The Tearclaws can even remove the inventory items without requiring Zhirov to actually be destroyed. The idea is to shoot one of the bots from just outside of one of the rooms and then retreat behind one of the doorways. This will let you safely use the melee Tearclaws while only getting attacked by 1 bot at a time."

"Zion","Location","Zion is a [[Caves]] [[Branch]] that appears on -7 or -6 and is the home to a large number of [[Derelict]] [[Zionite|Zionites]]. It is a general safe haven for all types of Derelict bots and has a ton of lore available by talking with all sorts of Zionites. Similar to Caves, [[Scrap]] and [[Derelict Log|Derelict Logs]] can appear on the ground here. Aside from one relatively harmless event, there are no hostile bots that appear on this map unless Cogmind attacks or attempts to enter while aligned with [[RIF]] or after becoming hostile to the [[UFD]]. The System Quarantine Field Array at the entrance of the map will cleanse all [[Corruption]]. It is strongly recommended to detach any ranged weapons until cleansing corruption to avoid any misfires that will turn the map hostile. RIF-aligned or UFD-hostile Cogmind can only go as far as triggering the cleanse at the quarantine array. Going any further will turn Zion hostile.
Zion maps are randomly generated but will always have the same overall appearance. There is a small Caves-like section on the east containing the spawn point and exit to Proximity Caves. To the left is the Quarantine Array machine guarded by 2 friendly [[Marauder (6)|Marauders]]. The bulk of Zion is contained within a large hollow square shape. All of the unique prefabs are contained within this area of the map. To the top left is the locked entrance to the [[Zion Deep Caves]]. Below that is a [[Tinkerer]] next to the Conduit Teleporter, 4 [[Mutant (6)|Mutants]], the [[Imprinter]], and some more Tinkerers next to the Imprinting Machine.
[[Heading]]Alignment - [[Imprint|Imprinting]][[/Heading]]Walking into the Imprinting machine will allow Cogmind to Imprint which has some major gameplay effects. The main change is that Cogmind can no longer use normal hacks at [[Terminal|Terminals]] and can now only use a specific set of randomized Zionite hacks. The 4 Mutants that guard the Imprinter will also turn purple and begin to follow you. There is an additional unique effect in [[Command]]: [[Redacted]]When the Command cave seals are opened, powerful Zionite bots will pop out along with various other Zionite-aligned Derelicts. These Zionites will be controllable (blue) rather than purple if a [[Core Reset Matrix]] is used.[[/Redacted]] This alignment has the following incompatibilities:
[[List]][[Farcom]]: The Imprinter will warn a Farcom-aligned Cogmind against trying to use the machine. If the machine is used anyway, the Zionites will take it as an attack and turn hostile.|RIF: A RIF-aligned Cogmind will turn Zion hostile when attempting to enter in the first place.|[[Revision 17]]: Revision 17 will be afraid of an imprinted Cogmind and will not attack -3 [[Research]].|[[Scraptown]] hostilities: Zion will become hostile to Cogmind who has become hostile to the UFD.|[[UFD]]: If Cogmind is a UFD member, The Imprinter will tell Cogmind that the imprinting machine vetting process will take a while and to come back another time.|[[Warlord]]: Warlord will be disappointed in an imprinted Cogmind and will not attack -2 Research.[[/List]]
[[Heading]]Fighting[[/Heading]]
Fighting Zion can be a risky feat for an unprepared Cogmind, but not particularly challenging if going in with a plan. The majority of the [[Zionite|Zionites]] are initially unarmed, although they can scavenge through the Twisted Machinery tiles in order to find several (usually weak) types of guns or melee weapons. Zionites will also appear out of the machinery tiles and instantly attack. This will only happen if Cogmind is within a few tiles of some machinery, so using explosive weaponry on these tiles is highly recommended to avoid unnecessarily fighting extra bots. It is not possible to destroy this machinery beforehand, as destroying too many of these tiles will cause Zion to turn hostile. After attacking, use launchers to take the machines out at range to avoid getting sneak attacked.
One of the largest benefits and threats to fighting Zion is the [[Z-Hero]] spawn. There is a chance that a hostile Hero will spawn at the Caves exit and roam around the map. It is important to have a plan to deal with some of the stronger Heroes like [[99-TNT]] and [[P1-3CE]], even if that plan is only to spot them first and run to avoid getting spotted in return. Other heroes like [[ME-RLN]] are easier to kill. All of them can provide incredibly strong unique loot. Another big reason to fight is the [[Imprinter Data Core]] that will guarantee access to the [[Zion Deep Caves]] if no other methods are available. One thing to note is that the Imprinter will not stick around long after attack. 300 turns after Cogmind angers Zion, the Imprinter will disappear and it will not be possible to get her Data Core. Starting hostilities by attacking her is recommended for this reason.

There are a wide variety of encounters in Zion. A few are useless, some are more niche, but most are going to have a use in many builds. Every game has a half dozen or so of these encounters available and it is likely that most builds will get something nice out of the trip.
[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There are 2 types of exits in Zion:[[List]][[Proximity Caves]] exit: This exit is on the top right side of the map near where Cogmind spawns.|[[Zion Deep Caves]] exit: This exit is on the top left side of the map protected by locked blast doors. The doors can be unlocked with a random Derelict event that will provide the hacking codes or with the same codes obtained by using the [[Imprinter Data Core]]. Additionally, the doors can be broken into with a very powerful Impact ([[Impact Mace]] or stronger) weapon, an overloadable Thermal cannon like a [[Cld. Particle Cannon]], or by using a [[Plasma Cutters|Plasma Cutter]]. The Sealed Blast Doors have an armor value of 45 with 0% thermal resistance but many other strong resistances.[[/List]][[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]
[[List]](+/-) [[Hunter]] attack: A Hunter disguised as a Derelict will sneak up to the gates of Zion and attack the Marauder guards. This will usually result in the quarantine array being destroyed and the Hunter losing the fight. The dropped parts can be collected by Cogmind but will quickly self-destruct.[[/List]]"
"Zion Deep Caves","Location","The Zion Deep Caves, or ZDC, is a [[Branch]] off of [[Zion]] that seems to serve as a sort of base of operations for the [[Imprinter]] and the Zionites. This is a very combat oriented map that requires a lot of preparation to complete entirely. It is possible for a very fast flight build to sneak in, grab one or two things, and escape, but the presence of the perfect-tracking 24 speed [[Z-Imprinter]] makes things tough.
The bulk of the map has a predefined layout except for the right starting point and middle-left exit area which are slightly different every time. These two random areas are mostly empty but can contain small groups of [[Assembled (4)|Assembled]] and a disabled [[Surveybot 24]]. To the left of the starting area are a big Z-Facility machine, a huge explosive Z-Power, and some [[Z-Technician|Z-Technicians]] working on the machine. Above and below are [[Z-Light (5)|Z-Light]] guards. On the top and left side there are Zionite item stashes. To the left side of the exit area is a collection of assorted broken Derelict bots and highly damaged parts. There is an [[Exiles (Location)|Exiles]] item near the top of the area. The far left is an Impregnable Wall which contains a large amount of Assembled and 2 [[Assembler|Assemblers]]. The wall is guarded by a [[Golem]] above and below. There are also some Wall Chambers that drop [[GOLEM Unit|GOLEM Units]] when destroyed. The units will start regrowing into hostile Golems.
While quite challenging, there are some very strong unique rewards on this map. GOLEM units are only available here and can provide a strong build in a-box. [[Asb. Focal Cannon|Focal Cannons]] will tear through most anything in the game quite easily. The [[Asb. Combat Suite]] is a unique part that combines [[Phase Shifters]], [[Targeting Computers]], and [[Core Analyzers]] in a single slot. The [[Surveybot 24 Chip]] is the strongest type of [[Terrain Scan Processors|Terrain Scan Processor]] in the game. [[Zio. Weapon Casing|Weapon Casings]] can protect late-game super-weapons from harm. The [[Zio. Biocell]] is an early way to gain a mostly identical [[Exp. Energy Well]] early in the game.
[[Heading]]Strategy[[/Heading]]
There are some key requirements to deal with each section of this map and common approaches for dealing with each. Here is a general checklist of things that will be useful throughout the map:
[[List]]Propulsion/Weapon/Armor + backups: You will do a lot of fighting in this map. Having backups of these more important parts will keep you alive.|[[Launchers]]: These can be used for the Z-Imprinter, Z-Lights, and especially for the Assembled in the wall. Multiple backups are recommended.|EM weapons: EM is the only effective way to fight Golems. EM traps like [[EM Surge Trap|EM Surge]] or [[Dirty Bomb Trap|Dirty Bombs]] can also be used but having at least 1 EM weapon is best to be safe.|(Optional) [[AS-neutralizer No. 17b]]: Completely neutralizes the threat of the Assembled wall.|(Optional) Allies: Makes the opening Z-Imprinter fight much easier to handle.|(Optional) Dead [[Imprinter]]: Killing the Imprinter in Zion prevents her from showing up in this map. She has no weapons in Zion so taking her out there can be an easy way to skip a big threat on this map.[[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]Starting Area[[/Heading:2]]
There isn't much threat here. There can be groups of 3 Assembled that can be easily dispatched by any weapons, although Launchers are most effective.
[[Image]]ZDC Allies.png|Fighting the Z-Imprinter with allies[[/Image]][[Image]]ZDC Imprinter Launcher.png|Aiming past the Imprinter with a Launcher[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]][[Z-Imprinter]][[/Heading:2]]
After entering the main open area of the map, the Z-Imprinter will spawn and head directly to Cogmind's location. 2 Z-Lights will follow the Imprinter but are much slower and will take some time to arrive. The Z-Imprinter has high evasion, 150 core integrity, and deals a large amount of damage every volley. Allies are highly recommended for this fight to help destroy her quicker and to draw fire from you. The Derelict ally events from Zion can help, as can the A8 code [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]]. Use the code on any of the gate terminals on the entrance to this map. A [[Tactical Coordination Suite]] can really help out with an ally damage. [[Targeting Computers]] or 2-slot Treads with [[Siege Mode]] are also recommended to be able to hit the Imprinter more frequently.
For Cogmind's build, any non-EM and non-Impact damage types will work. To get the [[Zio. Metafield Generator]], +Salvage is recommended by using guns with the best available type of [[Salvage Targeting Computers|Salvage Targeting Computer]]. Although it doesn't deal much damage, EM can be used to apply +Salvage if allies are providing enough damage output otherwise. If salvage isn't needed, using Explosive Launchers will be very effective here. Rather than aiming directly at the Imprinter, aim the launcher at a wall or at the end of its range so that the Imprinter is still hit close to the source. This will maintain a high accuracy while still dealing the bulk of the damage to the Imprinter. This technique can also be used against the Z-Lights to good effect.
After the Z-Imprinter is dead, take care that your allies don't spot the Z-Technicians by the Z-Power machine. They will almost assuredly miss into the machine and end up nuking themselves, and if you're not careful, Cogmind. Beware its large 15 tile radius.
[[Heading:2]][[Z-Light]] Guards[[/Heading]]The top and bottom of the map have groups of 3 Z-Light guards. There are 2 groups on the top and one on the bottom. All of these are optional encounters. To avoid them, dig through the center of the Z-Facility and hang near the left side of the area. Enter the tunnel near the top side to avoid getting spotted by the bottom group. The top Z-Lights are often worth fighting because of the large number of special Zionite parts they guard. It is possible to reach the first alcove on the top without getting spotted, but the remainder are all guarded
If Cogmind still has strong allies like Enhanced Grunts alive from the Z-Light encounter, it is possible to just charge in and fight them all at once. They are not as dangerous as the Z-Imprinter, but in large numbers they can still pack a punch. Using Launchers is very effective on these bots since they don't tend to be very tanky as long as you can actually hit them. Using a [[Transmission Jammers|Transmission Jammer]] to lure them 1 at a time can also be an effective strategy if fighting with non-launcher weapons to preserve salvage.
[[Heading:2]]Exit Area[[/Heading]]
Same as the starting area, the only threat here is small groups of 3 Assembled.
[[Heading:2]][[Golem|Golems]][[/Heading]]
Golems are incredibly tanky enemies with an extreme damage output and the source of many lost runs. In order to claim a GOLEM Unit or the Exiles item, Cogmind must fight or at least run past them. Conventional weapons do not work at all here. With a 10% core exposure, 200 core integrity, and 15% damage resistance to non-melee damage types, trying to fight fairly is suicide. The best approach is EM damage or Impact. Golems only require an average of 118 damage to corrupt them to death compared to thousands of damage with non-EM weapons. Using [[Zio. Weapon Casing|Weapon Casings]] looted earlier may be helpful here to avoid losing your only way to fight.
Due to uneven calculations for line-of-sight and weapon range, it is possible to shoot the Golems once before you are spotted at 16 range. See the Golem 1/2 spots below for reference. This allows Cogmind to wait 2 turns before shooting to avoid any movement accuracy penalties, since every turn counts particularly hard when fighting a Golem. If using EM traps, short ranged EM weapons, or Impact weapons, see the lure images for reference. This will get Cogmind spotted, likely get shot at for 1 volley, and then draw the Golem in closer. This can avoid misses or misfires opening the GOLEM Unit chambers and accidentally triggering the wall early. However, keep in mind that if Cogmind misses or if the Golem misfires into one of the chambers, the wall will open instantly. Luring the Golems out of range where they can attack the GOLEM Unit containers is recommended. The Exiles item will typically require fighting the top Golem, but getting a GOLEM unit typically requires fighting both Golems.

[[Heading:2]][[Assembled (4)|Assembled]] Wall[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]ZDC Wall Activation Zone.png|Approximate wall activation zone[[/Image]]
The Assembled wall is an indestructible wall containing 35 Assembled and 2 [[Assembler|Assemblers]] that will automatically open up when Cogmind gets too close to it, or if any of the GOLEM Unit chambers are destroyed. See the image on the right for a range reference. This range encompasses the GOLEM Unit containers, so fighting the wall is typically required to grab them.
Fighting the wall practically requires Launchers to avoid becoming overwhelmed. Any kinds of launchers work, although explosive launchers are better due to their higher range and base damage. Trying to use launchers at a range where they won't miss and take out the GOLEM unit containers is ideal. Otherwise it can be slightly annoying up to even deadly to have a large number of growing Golems running around. They grow slowly, but trying to deal with the Assembled and growing Golems at the same time can be a recipe for disaster. Alternately, the [[AS-neutralizer No. 17b]] can be used here to almost entirely eliminate any threat of the wall. The Assemblers will still need to be destroyed, but the rest of the Assembled will become useless.
[[Heading:2]]Loot[[/Heading]]
After everything else is cleaned out, all that's left is claiming the loot. Wall Chambers will drop [[GOLEM Unit|GOLEM Units]] when destroyed. They will turn into a Golem in a few turns, so grab them quickly. They can drop their GOLEM Unit upon being destroyed (standard loot rules), so applying positive and negative Salvage affects Golem reformation. Using melee weapons is recommended to avoid missing into other containers and spawning further Golems.
The Exiles item will normally require fighting both the wall and the top Golem. One alternative to grab it is using the Zion special item [[Phasing AFG]]. By using it, the item can be pulled in without any fighting on the left side of the map.
