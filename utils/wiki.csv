"Access","Location","Access is the last [[0b10]]-controlled main floor that only appears on -1. Access is the most challenging main map with increased patrol density, number of bots per patrol, map size, and level and difficulty in hackable machines compared to [[Research]]. These maps have a 150x300 tile size, either being a tall vertical level or a wide horizontal level. Access maps tend to be fairly well connected across corridors and rooms, and have fewer large rooms and larger hallways more similar to [[Factory]] than the cramped maze-like layout of Research. There are only 2 exits in Access, and locating and taking the desired exit can be especially challenging.
In contrast with the small number of exits, Access has the highest number of [[Garrison (Machine)|Garrisons]] with 6 machines spread throughout the level. Shutting or destroying Garrisons is always a good idea, but there is a special interaction in Access: [[Spoiler]]If all 6 Garrisons are shut down or disabled, [[Maximum Security]] will be triggered, sending huge waves of hostiles directly to Cogmind. Either be prepared to fight your way out, or have an escape route planned for a fast airborne build to avoid engaging in combat.[[/Spoiler]]
The biggest bot upgrade in Access is the [[Behemoth]] change. All Behemoths will become [[B-99 Colossus|Colossi]], extremely dangerous and hard to kill threats. They have some incredibly good loot, but trying to kill them with conventional methods is difficult due to their high damage output, high integrity, and [[Adv. Force Field]] reducing damage they take. Avoiding them or running if spotted is usually the best plan.
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
There is one special machine in Access. The Energy Cycler is a large explosive machine that appears in rooms with a 2 tile wide doorway. When it is destroyed, several [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]] will spawn from Garrisons and start roaming around the map. Additionally, all of the sealed heavy doors on the map will retract, allowing access to exits.

[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There are 2 types of exits on Access floors. Both exits can be identified by long 2 tile wide corridors leading to the [[Terminal]]-locked side of the exits. They are both identifiable by look alone:
[[List]][[Surface]] exit: There are 2 sides to this Surface exit. One side is locked behind an 80 armor Sealed Barrier locked by a [[Terminal]] with a base 7% open chance. The other side has Sealed Heavy Doors that are much easier to break through, but is guarded by 2 Colossi. Blowing up the Energy Cyclers will open only the side with the Sealed Barrier. Trying to rush head-on past the Behemoths is usually not recommended due to their extreme damage output and heavy knockback.|[[Redacted]][[Command]] exit: There are 2 sides to this Command exit. One side has a 2 tile snaking corridor that has 3 consecutive Sealed Barriers. Each has a base 30% open chance. The other side has a single row of Sealed Heavy Doors, a guard area with 2 Terminators and 2 Colossi, and 3 more Sealed Heavy Doors blocking the exit. Blowing up the Energy Cycler will only open the side with the 3 Sealed Barriers.[[/Redacted]][[/List]]

"Access_0","Location","Access_0 is a non-[[0b10]] [[Branch]] off of [[Command]] that only appears on -1. It is the home to the [[Architect]], the [[A bots]], and several types of Enhanced bots. Access_0 is a very heavily combat-oriented map that has 2 unique wintypes available and has the Architect present, a special boss bot that will award a + on the scoresheet when defeated. It features a multitude of unique bots, a unique bossfight mechanic, and many of the strongest hostiles in the game to fight.
The overall structure of Access_0 can be split into 2 groups with a small bridge connecting section guarded by [[A2]]. The bulk of the map is on the right side, with the bridge dividing a small section of the left side of the map. Overall, the layout is comparable to a  more maze-like [[Caves]]. There are many dead ends and nearly-connected areas that can be safely dug out when noticed with terrain scanning. Cogmind spawns on the right side of the map along with the Architect, [[A8]], and 2 [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]]. The right side of the map can contain [[Alien Artifacts|Alien Artifact]]-containing Workstation machines, large item caches on the ground or in Reinforced Shells, random bits of machinery, and Subspace Access Nodes. Typically, there are 4 Access Nodes on the right side of the map, although very rarely one can appear on the left. Otherwise, the left side can contain all the same things that the right side has and a few more. The left side will always contain a Singularity Gate machine along with a Gate Controls Terminal that can control it. At the bottom left of the map, there is an Architect Logs Terminal wrapped in a 120 armor Architect Shell.
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:3]]Subspace Access Node[[/Heading]]
There are 4 of these Access Nodes, also known as ""pads"" on the map. They serve as nodes for the Architect to appear at after teleporting out. Destroying all 4 is required to fight the Architect normally.
[[Heading:3]]Singularity Gate[[/Heading]]
A large and fragile machine on the left side of the map. If this machine is intact when the Architect is destroyed, a countdown of 10 turns will begin. If Cogmind is still on the map and the gate is not destroyed in that timeframe, Cogmind will be instantly destroyed. It is possible to activate the machine by performing the Gate Test 138-A and Gate Test 138-B hacks. This will an approximately 5 tile radius singularity that draws bots and parts in and destroys them instantly if the center is reached. This singularity will stop if the gate is destroyed. The Architect will intentionally target the gate to break it while in this state. The Gate Test 138-END will shut down the singularity. One additional hack, 138-C, requires the [[A2 Data Core]] which can be achieved by destroying A2. Performing this hack will immediately end the run and result in a [[Wintypes|W5 Wintype]]. If the singularity gate is still intact when the Architect is destroyed, the gate will be activated and can not be shut down by normal means. Cogmind must exit the map within 10 turns or destroy the singularity gate or else Cogmind will be instantly destroyed. If Cogmind exits the map while the countdown is going off, this will result a W6 wintype.
[[Heading:3]]Architect Logs[[/Heading]]
The Architect shell has 120 armor and is extremely difficult to break through by force. However, defeating the Architect will drop the [[Architect Data Core]] which will result in the shell retracting and revealing the inner Terminal that contains a large number of unique lore entries.
[[Heading:3]]Dimensional Slip Node[[/Heading]]
There is a Dimensional Slip node installed near the top of the map. Using a [[Transdimensional Reconstructor|regular]] or [[Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor]] will always go to this location. An exit is a few tiles away from this spot. If the Architect is still alive when Cogmind appears here, the log message [[GameText]]I have more important things to do than play hide-and-seek. Deal with this piece of junk if it returns.[[/GameText]] will appear, and the Architect will disappear off of the map and will not return.

[[Heading:2]]Caches[[/Heading]]There are several types of caches in Access_0, although they all draw from the same pool of potential items. This pool contains all rating 6-9 [[Prototype Part|Prototype]] parts accessible normally in 0b10 in stockpiles. It does not include any unique parts such as items found in [[Testing]] shells. These Prototype parts will never be faulty.
[[Heading:2]]Alien Artifacts[[/Heading]]
There are typically multiple Alien Artifacts held in 40 armor Workstation machines. If there are any, one will be guaranteed to be a Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor. The full list of available Alien Artifacts are:
[[List]][[Core Expander]]|[[Core Regenerator]]|[[Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor]]|[[Integrated Dissipator]]|[[Integrated Mediator]]|[[Integrated Reactor]]|[[Integrity Redistributor]]|[[Sigix Broadsword]][[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]There is a single exit in Access_0. A [[Surface]] exit is buried behind several dozen tiles of earth near the top of the map. It can be accessed via the Dimensional Slip Node by using a regular or Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor or by digging deep into the earth.
[[Heading]]Special bots[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:2]]The [[Architect]][[/Heading]]
The Architect is the true final boss of Cogmind. It has a multitude of strong offensive and defensive parts, resistances to most common damage types, 400 core, innate core and part regeneration, perfect always-active tracking on Cogmind's position, and a whopping 28 speed to top it all off. There is also a unique mechanic where the Architect will teleport to a nearby Subspace Access Node under various conditions. This includes: falling to 80% of core integrity (320/400), losing 2/3 Modified Sigix Shearguns, or becoming overweight. It will always have perfect tracking to Cogmind and never give up pursuit. It also has ""Behemoth AI"", where it will try to shoot Cogmind through several layers of tiles. This can be exploited by moving behind walls where repeated shots will take out wall tiles instead of hitting Cogmind.
The Architect can not be destroyed by most methods unless all 4 of the subspace access nodes are destroyed first. The one exception to this rule is that dealing 400 core damage in a single turn can destroy the Architect. While technically possible with a large enough weapon volley, this method of killing is primarily reserved to a few unique weapons, like the [[BFG-9k Vortex Edition]], the [[L-Cannon]], a [[Sigix Exoskeleton]]-boosted [[Core Cannon]], or 2 Core Cannons.
[[Heading:3]]Special Weapon Interactions[[/Heading]]
There are a few weapons that have special interactions with the Architect.
[[Heading:4]][[Sigix Terminator]]/[[Supercharged Sigix Terminator]][[/Heading]]
Using either of these weapons will cause the Architect to wrap to the nearest subspace node, resulting in the log message [[GameText]]I'm all too familiar with what that does.[[/GameText]] This effect will only occur if one or more subspace nodes are intact. Due to the way the Architect teleports, it is possible to hit it with the explosion, but only if the pad that the Architect teleports to is within range. This can be used to take out the last pad and land a hit on the Architect at the same time.
[[Heading:4]][[L-Cannon]][[/Heading]]
Similar to the terminators, it is not possible to hit the Architect with the L-Cannon unless the subspace nodes are all destroyed. The log message [[GameText]]I'm aware you stole the capacitor, you know...[[/GameText]] will accompany the Architect teleporting to the nearest subspace node. Even if the nodes are taken down, destroying the singularity gate is required before using the L-Cannon for the killing blow. Otherwise Cogmind will be crushed in the 10 turn countdown since the weapon itself takes 10 turns of delay after firing.
[[Heading:3]]Self-destruct codes[[/Heading]]
If any Enhanced bots or A bots are assimilated by disruption and rewiring or via the [[Field Lobotomy Kit]] and the Architect spots them, a log message [[GameText]]Architect flashes a signal at [Bot Name].[[/GameText]] will appear, and the bot will self-destruct. Bots that self-destruct will drop loot normally according to their salvage. This usually results in some pretty large loot pile explosions, especially for some of the lower numbered A bots. Although these bots cannot be used as allies, assimilation is a good way to let the Architect get rid of them rather than fighting them yourself.
[[Heading:3]]Defeat[[/Heading]]
The Architect is a sore loser. If destroyed, the Singularity Gate will be activated (if intact) and trigger a 10 turn countdown. Cogmind must either use a Transdimensional Reconstructor and escape out the exit at the top of the map near the Slip Node or destroy the Gate machine within these 10 turns to avoid instant death.
[[Heading:2]][[A bots]][[/Heading]]
The A bots are a series of very powerful and unique enemies, most of which only appearing in Access_0 or are allies on other maps. A8 appears at the entrance to the map and A2 guards the ""bridge"" to the left side of the map. [[A7]] does not appear on this map at all. Other than that, [[A6]], [[A5]], [[A4]], and [[A3]] all appear after Cogmind has explored a certain percentage of the map. They appear at roughly 10-15%, 25-30%, 45-50%, and 70-75% map exploration respectively. This is only affected by tiles seen by Cogmind and not other forms of intel such as drones or terrain scanning. If A8 was destroyed in [[Zion]], or A5 was in [[Lab]], they will not appear in Access_0. All A bots also maintain perfect tracking on Cogmind and can not be shaken forever.
[[Heading:2]][[Enhanced Programmer|Enhanced Programmers]][[/Heading]]
Enhanced Programmers are a unique type of bot that can show up in Access_0, but only under certain conditions. Using the [[Data Miner|Data Miner's]] [[Data Conduit]] or bringing more than 2 combat allies (bots with weapons) into the map will trigger these bots to spawn. They are extremely tough bots with many resistances and carry an [[Imp. Energy Mantle]] that will shield other allies. They will roam around the map as lone patrol bots.
[[Heading]]Unlockable Architect Logs[[/Heading]]
Similar to the Lab orders, there are some unique lore entries in the Architect Logs that can only be obtained by performing specific actions before that point. To read these logs, Cogmind must either defeat the Architect or have a strong enough weapon to break through the 120 armor shell that also doesn't break the frail Terminal inside it.
[[List]]Log L.L98W4A5V: Use the Data Miner's Data Conduit.
|Log L.MJH3MJHF: Save [[Revision 17]] in [[Cetus]] by defeating all of the [[Cetus Guard|Cetus Guards]]. Revision 17 must die before Cogmind exits the map.
|Log L.NV345OIG: Save Revision 17 in Cetus while keeping the manufacturing module intact and exiting while Revision 17 is still alive, triggering the -3 Revision 17 invasion event. Revision 17 must also survive until Cogmind exits the map on -3.
|Log L.PLVSNE0F: Trigger the Revision 17 invasion event, but Revision 17 must die in -3.

|Log L.T4KTHQWA: Expose Zhirov by destroying the Cloak Generator machine, but he must survive the attack and teleport away.
|Log L.UHGC2ASH: Fail to ally with [[Warlord]] in [[Warlord (Location)]] by either being [[Imprint|Imprinted]] or by not visiting Warlord in the map. Warlord must not have died at his base.
|Log L.VFLK3RLK: Ally with Warlord at his base and Warlord must survive the -2 assault.
|Log L.WEK5AVLJ: Ally with Warlord at his base and Warlord must die at the -2 assault.[[/List]]
[[Heading]]Getting the Architect's + Strategy (defeating the Architect)[[/Heading]]
Access_0 is an especially tough map in Cogmind, arguably the toughest to defeat. It typically relies on Cogmind single-handedly dealing with a myriad of threats on the map with little breathing room for fixing a build that is starting to fall apart. Assuming MAIN.C is defeated in Command, there is a large amount of preparation that can be done after all of the bots have turned off. MAIN.C's cache can provide some incredibly powerful parts, and the rest of the map can have plenty of goodies to grab. Since Access_0 is a very combat-oriented map, make sure to bring backups of essentials like power, propulsion, weapons, and armor. While there are some part caches in Access_0 itself, their contents are not super reliable and shouldn't be relied on to fix a build. More consistent are the drops from the Enhanced bots and the A bots, assuming weapons with neutral salvage can be used at least some of the time. There tend to be abundant legs and mediocre-quality power above all else from the Grunts and Hunters. The Grunt's [[Neutron Cannon|Neutron Cannons]] can serve in a pinch, but aren't incredibly strong.
All propulsion types can be used in Access_0, although some are definitely better suited than others. Hover and legs are nice middle ground propulsion that can have a lot of power and still retain maneuverability. Treads are the best heavy combat type with lots of coverage and integrity but may get stuck fighting in bad situations with no good way to reposition. Wheels are a little more niche than treads due to the rarity of good wheel propulsion types. Flight is the easiest to use to take down all of the pads but can struggle the most to finish off the Architect in the final fight.
[[Heading:2]]Flight[[/Heading]]
Flight builds should be extremely quick at this point in the game (sub 20 speed) and are able to outrun every bot on the map. Flight does not have the integrity for prolonged fighting and typically wants to destroy the pads first and then try to lure the Architect away from all of the other bots for a quick kill. Evasion utilities work especially well to minimize the number of attacks that land. A Shield Generator or Force Field also work well, but may be tough to support. A bots are a major threat to this playstyle, as their remote force fields can draw out the final encounter to the point that Cogmind is unable to finish off the Architect. Critical weapons can be good for taking out a few enhanced bots or removing hover units off of key A bots so they don't catch up as quickly for the final fight. A strong final Architect-killer weapon is a must for this strategy. [[ECM Suites]] can be used to take a little pressure off of the mass of bots that end up following any flight build.
[[Heading:2]]Hover[[/Heading]]
Hover builds tend to be the hardest to put together but can end up with a good mix of speed, offensive, and defensive capabilities. Using a [[Zio. Metafield Generator]] or [[ST Field Compressor]] can help to outrun groups of bots or reposition more easily. However, a strategy entirely based on running away tends to fare much worse for hover builds due to the lower speed and ability to get trapped by inability to hop in some tight 1 tile corridors. Hover builds should choose their fights carefully and can reposition in combat to avoid getting outnumbered.
[[Heading:2]]Legs[[/Heading]]
Leg builds finally start to trend into the area where having a reliable way to ""shoo"" (deal 80 core damage to trigger the teleport) the Architect is a requirement. While legs can take advantage of the movement bonuses to dodge (5/10/15 extra evasion per tile moved in a row) and can avoid most of the shuts while running in a straight line for a while, they can still take a lot of times trying to move into a better fighting spot constantly. Legs builds need to be reasonably offensively focused. Infowar like terrain scanning or drones can help locate the pads quicker and reduce total attrition taken from the Architect coming back repeatedly. One option for legs is a ""siege legs"" build, where an extra pair of treads are used in addition to the standard legs. This requires 2 extra propulsion slots above what Cogmind already needs to support for the full effect. Being overweight on legs is not ideal in Access_0. The benefits of this strategy are that the Enhanced Hunters can't continually knock Cogmind back into collapsed tiles due to the knockback cancellation ability of treads, and siege mode can be used for tough encounters. The treads also have higher coverage than legs even when not sieged and can take a little more damage.
[[Heading:2]]Wheels/Treads[[/Heading]]
Wheels and treads are the slowest Access_0 propulsion types, and as such need to be the most prepared for heavy combat. Lots of armor and strong weaponry are required for these builds. Wheel builds tend to have lower propulsion slots and higher utility slots, necessitating more utility slots being taken up by armor to compensate. Treads usually have 6-8 propulsion slots and can afford to run less armor in utility slots due to the higher propulsion coverage. Terrain scanning and drones are especially recommended for these builds to reduce the pad finding time. They will end up needing to shoo the Architect repeatedly throughout the level and fight every bot they meet.
[[Heading:2]][[Sigix Exoskeleton]][[/Heading]]
The Exoskeleton plays a little differently from the other propulsion types. Due to its incredible amount of builtin infowar, it is quite easy to find and destroy all of the Architect's pads. With the Sigix Shearcannon it is quite easy to destroy every bot on the map in a few volleys. A Core Cannon can also kill the Architect from full integrity which allows skipping the pad destroying altogether. With weaker weapons than those, the Exoskeleton tends to play like a hover build without much shooing power, taking a few specific encounters and killing A bots but mostly running from the Architect in favor of searching and destroying the pads first before finding a good location for the final fight.
[[Heading:2]]Key Weapon Roles[[/Heading]]
Some weapon types excel at some situations and not in others. Entropic, Kinetic, Pierce, Slashing, Thermal, Vortex damage-dealing weapons all tend to be good all-around in Access_0. Electromagnetic damage is decent in a few key places, while Impact and Explosive damage tend to be subpar. However, there are some particularly useful weapons for specific circumstances. Ratings below include (-) = not suitable for role, (~) = passable for role, (+) = good for role, (++) = great for role. Ratings are a combination of how good the weapon is at killing something, its + or - salvage potential, and resource costs of use.

[[List:Ordered]]The Core Cannon is very strong vs most bots in Access_0 but costs too much core to use consistently, it will often result in early death by core.|Critical hits can disarm or destroy propulsion/weapons of some coring immune bots but not kill directly. Mostly niche use for flight/hover.|A6 is neutral to EM and annoying to kill otherwise, but all other A bots are 75% resistant.|Vortex Lances are the strongest melee weapon here but they have limited uses and should be used sparingly. A bots and the Architect final fight are the best uses for the Vortex Lance as a primary weapon.|Multirails are reasonable Architect shooers, but they have a very high matter upkeep. A [[Desublimator]] or other matter regenerating utilities are recommended to allow Multirails to shoo over a long period of time.|The Sigix Shearcannon has incredible firepower but it comes with a caveat. Cogmind must typically be within 2-4 tiles of the target in order to gain maximum damage potential. Otherwise the weapon's arc will cause some projectiles to miss, with higher percentages of projectiles missing at further distances. This weapon is best suited for faster propulsion types, although even treads can make good use if it in some situations.|Vortex weaponry is quite powerful and good at killing all in Access_0. However, it is not good to use for fighting everything as they have limited usages. A bots and the final Architect kill tend to be the most important uses.|These launchers have very strong killing power and Architect shooing potential. However, the incredibly high matter cost makes them not a good choice for regular usage. One or two [[Prc. Matter Filter|Prc. Matter Filters]] along with a Desublimator may make this a more reliable option, but it may be a bad idea to rely too heavily on launchers without other good options due to the risk of running out of matter entirely.|The Alpha Cannon Mk. II does not need any particle charging in some situations but does in others. It naturally kills 120 integrity Enhanced Grunts/Hunters in 2 hits with its base 65 damage. A bots and Enhanced Sentries have 150 core integrity which takes 3 hits. However, an Adv. Particle Charger ups the damage to 81. This turns those 3 hits into a 2 hit kill. This also matters for the Architect, where 81 damage will guarantee the shoo on a single core hit instead of requiring 2 hits.[[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]Other useful parts[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:3]]Targeting[[/Heading]]
Specifically, [[Adv. Targeting Computer|Adv.]] or [[Exp. Targeting Computer]] or [[Asb. Combat Suite]], for ranged combat, [[Adv. Melee Analysis Suite|Adv.]] or [[Exp. Melee Analysis Suite]] for melee. Targeting is the most important combat utility to use in Access_0. The Architect and Enhanced Hunters all run [[Exp. Phase Shifter|Exp. Phase Shifters]] which dramatically reduce chance to hit ranged attacks. Running at least 2 targeting utilities is extremely recommended to maintain a high chance to hit.
[[Heading:3]]Core chance to hit boosters[[/Heading]]
Specifically, [[Core Analyzer|Regular]] or [[Exp. Core Analyzer]] or Asb. Combat Suite and [[Imp. Armor Integrity Analyzer|Imp.]] or [[Exp. Armor Integrity Analyzer]]. Next to targeting, the best offensive utilities to use. Core Analyzer is superior, but they both work together and an Armor Integrity Analyzer should be used over the second Core Analyzer if there is space.
[[Heading:3]][[Weapon Cyclers]]/[[Actuators]][[/Heading]]
Weapon cycling is another great way to increase the damage done. Keep in mind they do require extra weapon energy/heat upkeep as the full volley will be fired more quickly than without. A [[Quantum Capacitor]] is good for any single powerful energy cannon, especially ones that can shoo the Architect in a single core hit.
[[Heading:3]][[Kinecellerators]]/[[Particle Chargers]][[/Heading]]
Nearly mandatory for some weapon types and less important for others. In some cases, like with the Omega Cannon and an Adv. Kinecellerator, it can be the difference between a single core hit Architect shoo and a double core hit Architect shoo.
[[Heading:3]][[Shield Generators]] and [[Force Fields]][[/Heading]]
Force fields are the best way to reduce damage in the game as long as their energy demands can be met. Airborne propulsion may want to use Shield Generators for their lesser energy requirements and lighter mass.
[[Heading:3]][[Phase Shifters]]/[[Reaction Control Systems]][[/Heading]]
All around good ways to reduce damage taken. Reaction Control Systems can only effectively be used by airborne propulsion types and legs.
[[Heading:3]][[Microwarp Drive]][[/Heading]]
This is especially useful for grounded propulsion types. The Microwarp Drive can be used to travel large distances very quickly in order to get to a specific pad location, reposition for a fight, or even just move around much quicker than normal. The core cost is prohibitive for constant warping, but this item can save a lot on overall build attrition with good use.
[[Heading:3]]Scouting Infowar[[/Heading]]
Specifically, [[Terrain Scanners]] with [[Terrain Scan Processors]], [[Drone Bays]], [[Visual Processing Units]] ,[[Structural Scanner]] or  [[Deep Structural Scanner|DSS]] variant. All of these provide extra map intel which can be used for locating pads more easily or finding shortcut digs that can be taken. The Structural Scanner is more useful for airborne propulsion than grounded propulsion since it works instantly and can be used to dodge groups of hostiles if running away. It doesn't typically help find the pads sooner like the others.
[[Heading:3]][[ECM Suites]][[/Heading]]
For airborne propulsion only. This can help take some pressure off by causing groups of followers to much more quickly lose tracking of Cogmind.
[[Heading:3]][[Triangulator]][[/Heading]]
This typically niche item has a unique ability in that it allows for tracking hostiles at 24 range even if they can't be seen via other sensor methods. The Architect has scan cloak 5 which prevents all other detection methods. Using the Triangulator can pinpoint the way the Architect is coming from at long range which can greatly help in determining pad locations.
[[Heading:3]]Matter generating utilities[[/Heading]]
Specifically, [[Desublimator]], [[Field Recycling Units]], [[Matter Filters]], [[Tractor Beams]], and [[Matter Compressors]] .For any kinetic based weapons or weapons that cause a lot of negative salvage like the Potential Cannons, having ways of stockpiling matter or restocking up on matter mid-map can be entirely essential to avoid losing the run due to running out of matter. The Desublimator can be found off of Enhanced Hunters only on this map, but the others can be brought over from earlier maps.
[[Heading:3]]Energy support[[/Heading]]
Specifically, [[Energy Wells]], [[Power Amplifiers]], and [[Energy Filters]]. All of these utilities can be used to maintain expensive energy cannons and force fields through prolonged combat. Energy wells can be dropped on the ground to instantly absorb the energy needed to keep firing, while the others must be attached to help.
[[Heading:3]]Remote [[Datajacks]][[/Heading]]
If the Data Conduit is used, Cogmind will be given intel for instant kill codes for all A bots that must be used with a Remote Datajack.
[[Heading:3]][[Terrabomb]][[/Heading]]
Although a little niche, Terrabombs do great at opening up a large part of the map to check for nearby pads. This is a double-edged sword since any nearby groups of enemies will spot you instantly, and the Architect can potentially start shooting from out of weapon range.
[[Heading:3]][[Sigix Terminator|Regular]] or [[Supercharged Sigix Terminator]][[/Heading]]
This single-use weapon is best used after taking down all of the pads in order to kill or at least severely cripple the Architect for the final fight. If airborne, this can also be used to kill off a lot of the bots following behind in a big mass.
[[Heading:3]]Regular or Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor[[/Heading]]
There is almost always one of these on the map somewhere and the Architect drops one when defeated. This can be an issue if defeating the Architect with a weapon with knockback like a kinetic cannon because it may be dropped too far away to pick up to exit the map in time. Also, keeping a spare is a way to escape with a non-Architect killing win if all hope is lost instead of dying in Access_0.
[[Heading:3]][[Core Reset Matrix]][[/Heading]]
There are several Alien Artifacts on the map and using the Core Reset Matrix ahead of time allows for locating them right away on entering the map. Sometimes being able to head for a Core Regenerator or Integrity Redistributor right away after entering the map is the difference between a loss and a win.
[[Heading:3]][[Integrity Redistributor]][[/Heading]]
Useful to prevent essential parts of the build from breaking or just generally to repair everything at once. Things with a limited but very high value such as shieldings or non-regenerative armor like [[Zio. Shade Armor]] or [[Exp. Powered Armor]] should be taken off preemptively at low integrity in order to use a Redistributor on them at a later time.
[[Heading:3]][[Core Regenerator]][[/Heading]]
Most helpful if using core-hungry Alien Artifacts like the Core Cannon, Microwarp Drive, or an Integrity Redistributor. It provides 400 (or more core with [[LRC Armor]] that can be used as more fuel. Sometimes it is better to use before entering the map if core is low enough.
[[Heading:3]][[Navigation Efficiency Matrix]][[/Heading]]
While this artifact can be very painful to use from the random teleportation, it does have some good usages in Access_0. When teleporting, all of the Enhanced bots lose tracking on Cogmind. This can be used on airborne propulsion to avoid getting large groups of Enhanced bots following behind, or on grounded propulsion to attempt to reposition or even avoid fighting groups of enemies. It is a mixed bag since it can just as easily teleport Cogmind into an even worse position than before.
[[Heading:2]]Stages of the map[[/Heading]]
There are several distinct stages of the map where different strategies can be used. Some playstyles may skip certain stages entirely, like how a flight build will typically not stick around for the initial map fight, while grounded propulsion builds will have to fight.
[[Heading:3]]Initial fight[[/Heading]]
Cogmind is confronted by the Architect, A8, and 2 dormant Enhanced Grunts. Rarely, a patrol of more Enhanced Grunts or Enhanced Hunters spawns close enough to also join in here. Flight will typically ignore this part and skip straight to hunting for the pads to destroy. Hover can kill all the bots and shoo the Architect right away or move deeper into the level and try to fight the bots one-on-one instead. Grounded propulsion usually need to fight right at the starting position, so be prepared with strong weaponry to begin with. Siege up right at the entrance of the map if using treads. Targeting the Architect for a shoo is usually the best approach, followed by A8, and finally the Enhanced Grunts. If lacking any good Architect shooing weapons, focusing A8 first may be preferable so A8's Remote Force Field won't be able to protect the Architect.
[[Heading:3]]Searching for the pads[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Access_0 Subspace Access Node.png|Subspace Access Node layout[[/Image]]
This stage is where the vast majority of the time spent in Access_0. This part involves running or actively fighting the Architect, Enhanced bot guards and patrols, and the A bots as they appear. Infowar utilities are most useful at this time. The general strategy for combat here is to shoo the Architect and then start heading in the direction that it came from. Since it typically comes from the closest pad, that is the best way to get in the right general area. If multiple pads are close by, this can be difficult as the Architect can start spawning at different pads and coming at different directions. Infowar is best to help find the pads in this situation, but if none is available then making a guess at the pad location and heading there is better than getting stuck moving back and forth in a loop, failing to get anywhere.
When using terrain scanning, there are often telltale signs of a pad even before getting the whole area scanned. Any of the 4 inner tiles or the 4 surrounding cyan tiles are very recognizable. The white tiles surrounding the machine are also not guaranteed to lead to a pad, but they are good to investigate. Finally, pads are always found at the end of 2 tile corridors. Following 2 tile paths can be a good way to get to the final pad location.
Drone Bays and especially Terrain Scanners tend to have high coverage and not the most impressive integrity. They should usually be swapped out during any prolonged combat encounters for offensive utilities or better armor. With a good shooing weapon, it may not be necessary to swap out every time the Architect comes. Making sure these important utilities don't get destroyed early can be very important. If using drones, the best time to release them is just before or right after the Architect teleports away. That gives them the maximum amount of time to explore before the Architect gets a chance to attack them.
If using the Data Conduit, finding the pads is easy since all the machines are revealed on entering the map. However, the additional Enhanced Programmer patrols can be a huge pain even when knowing exactly where to go. Make sure to have a good answer to these Programmers.
Most of the A bots are fairly similar in overall strategy to fight. Most have remote force fields that shield allies, so the A bots are a high priority to take out first. EM is ineffective against all of them except for A6, for which EM is the best solution. Generally any other damage type is fine for taking out the rest of them. Core Stripper and Disintegrator are uniquely good for killing some of the A bots because they guarantee (or nearly guarantee) full salvage of all parts.
[[Heading:3]]Destroying the Singularity Gate (optional)[[/Heading]]
Destroying the gate is an optional action that needs to be done in order to obtain any Architect Logs lore unless there is another way in. Otherwise, the singularity will crush Cogmind before there is enough time to get the lore. The gate is on the left side of the map and A2 is on the way. The gate itself is very fragile and just about any weapon will destroy it easily. It is best to get rid of nearby pads on the right side of the map before crossing the bridge so the Architect takes longer to get to Cogmind's location. After that, take the trek back to finish off the final pad and the Architect.
[[Heading:3]]The final pad[[/Heading]]
After all the other pads are destroyed, the Architect will continually teleport back to the last pad. This can be frustrating for grounded propulsion, where after being shooed the Architect will return after only a few moves as you get closer and closer. At a certain point, it is best to ignore the Architect and just walk by until the last pad is destroyed. Faster propulsion types have an easier time of doing this, and the Microwarp Drive can help a lot here. Putting on evasion utilities helps to reduce the damage taken during this last walk.
[[Heading:3]]The final fight[[/Heading]]
After all this, the Architect can finally be fought normally. For grounded builds, siege up with any treads if you have them, then start fighting to the death. Frailer airborne builds might need to lure the bulk of the pursuers to one corner of the map and then take the Architect to the other side of the map to avoid getting overwhelmed.
[[Heading:3]]Escape/cleaning up[[/Heading]]
After the Architect is destroyed, the Singularity Gate will be triggered if it is still intact and a 10 turn countdown will trigger. Grounded builds may need to be close to the Architect if relying on the Transdimensional Reconstructor that it drops. Otherwise the singularity countdown will kill Cogmind on the escape. Most grounded propulsion builds will need to detach all parts and core hover to equip the Reconstructor and to the exit if this happens. Airborne propulsion usually have enough time to get to the exit without needing to do this.
If the gate is destroyed, however, you are free to take your time to clean up any stragglers on the map and exit whenever. Get the Architect Data Core and head to the bottom-left corner of the map to open up the Architect Logs Terminal and obtain any new lore. Exploring the rest of the map will cause all remaining A bots to spawn as normal. The A bots and any other remaining Enhanced bots can be fought for extra points.","Redacted","","","","",""
"Archives","Location","Archives is a [[0b10]]-controlled [[Factory]] [[Branch]] that appears between -6 and -4. It is part of the [[Extension]] branch line and can only be entered through [[Cetus]]. It is a lightly guarded static map that has the same layout every time. There are 4 [[Sentry|Sentries]] and a large number of [[O-32 Director|Operators]]. Except for 1 special map variation, all 4 of the Archive Hub machines are useless and contain no data. No normal squads can spawn on this map.

"Armory","Location","Armory is a [[0b10]]-controlled [[Factory]]/[[Research]] [[Branch]] that appears between -4 and -3. It is a tough map with tight corridors, few available paths, an above average number of patrols, and special dormant and guard bots. There are several unique types of patrols on this map as well, with a [[Demolisher]] leading a squad of [[Grunt|Grunts]] and [[Duelist]] squads with a [[Protector]] in tow. Stealth builds will have a difficult time of sneaking past unnoticed and combat hostiles must be ready to do a lot of killing to get by. If Cogmind can survive, some of the rewards are rewirable allies, a high number of [[Fabricator|Fabricators]], and large stockpiles of out-of-depth parts.
The overall map structure varies, but there are some common features of Armory maps. There are usually corridors running horizontally on the bottom and top of the map that contain large rooms next to each other connected by Emergency Access doors. The map can be a little maze-like although heading to the left and crossing from bottom to top or top to bottom will usually lead to an exit.
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
There is one type of special machine in Armory. The Energy Cycler is a large explosive machine that will open all Sealed Heavy Doors on the map and summon several patrols. These Sealed Heavy Doors have hackable Terminals and contain high rating part stockpiles, sometimes full of entirely non-faulty [[Prototype Part|Prototype Parts]].

It is sealed off by 50 armor Sealed Blast doors that can be opened with a 30% success rate Terminal. The inner area has an unavoidable special alarm that triggers when entered.

"Caves","Location","Caves is the most frequent [[Branch]] map throughout all of [[Factory]] depths. It is a non-[[0b10]]-controlled map where [[Derelict|Derelicts]] often roam free and hostile 0b10 squads patrol and can be taken out without fear of reinforcements. Non-patrolling 0b10 outposts guarded by a [[Sentry]] and dormant bots are common. Every depth has 2 guaranteed Caves exits and each Caves map is a part of a series of 3 maps in a row. Not counting event-based exits, all first Caves maps of each depth can only be exited by entering the second Caves map. Caves maps do not have very many regular parts on the ground, but piles of [[Scrap]] contain usable but partially damaged parts and [[Derelict Log|Derelict Logs]] can give unique intel about upcoming floors.
There are different names for the different types of Caves maps and they have slightly different characteristics. Lower Caves is the name given to the first 2 Caves maps on -7 and -6, while Caves maps on -5 and -4 are named Upper Caves. The third caves map is accessible only by exiting the depth-specific special branch at the left side of the second caves map and is called Proximity Caves, regardless of depth. Lower and Upper Caves are very similar in all but [[Robot Tier]], but Proximity Caves tends to be more densely populated with patrols. They also contain [[N-01 Spotter|Spotters]] that will report armed hostiles on sight, causing a 150 alert increase per spot when entering the next map. This caps at 900 alert gained.
Caves are patrolled lightly by hostile 0b10 bots compared to the main floors. [[Infowar]] utilities are a good option to avoid unnecessary encounters as many patrols can be avoided with a bit of patience. Caves have a unique mechanic where parts dropped from 0b10 bots will automatically self-destruct after a few turns. Looting must be done quickly or else the dropped parts will be lost forever. The only 2 ways around this mechanic are [[Self-destruct Interrupter|Self-destruct Interrupters]] and [[Electromagnetic Weapons]]. The interrupters will prevent the parts from frying while active and EM damage will interfere with the self-destruct mechanism. While EM will give [[Corrupted Parts]], it is far better to end up with corrupted parts than to end up with no parts at all.
Due to the low rate of good parts spawning on the floor and the overall difficulty in looting hostile 0b10 bots, it is very easy for an unprepared build to fall apart in these maps. Bringing plenty of spares into Caves is highly recommended to avoid running out of essentials like propulsion, weapons, and armor. [[Launchers]] are a must here to handle ambushes of large numbers of 0b10 bots hiding in outposts. Launchers are also incredibly useful when entering a Caves map because the standard spawn protection that is present in 0b10 maps doesn't apply here. That means that one (or more) patrols can appear right in Cogmind's face on entering a map.
[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]
[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Caves[[/Lore]]
[[Heading]]Navigation[[/Heading]]
Cave maps all have a very similar overall layout. While the paths within the caves are unpredictable, these maps can typically be divided into 6 equal chunks. Top left, top middle, top right, bottom left, bottom middle, and bottom right. Cogmind will always spawn from the top right or bottom right chunks in Lower and Upper Caves or the top left or bottom left chunks in Proximity caves. One exit will always be in the chunk furthest from Cogmind. In the second Lower or Upper Caves map, the unique branch exit will be in that furthest chunk and the exit back to the main floor will always be on the same side. A good rule of thumb is that left is away from 0b10 while right is toward 0b10.

[[Heading]]Checkpoints[[/Heading]]
Caves checkpoints are square-shaped open spaces with a guard positioned at the center with possibly other robots stationed nearby.
There are three types of checkpoints:

Caves has one of the largest collections of prefabs of all the maps in the game, with a wide mix of good and bad prefabs. One of the strongest prefabs, the derelict [[Researcher]] with a [[Core Expander]], is so strong that it alone can be a good reason to go into Caves.
The most common encounters on this map tend to be the many different forms of 0b10 outposts. [[Transmission Jammer|Transmission Jammers]] are highly recommended to take bots in these outposts out one at a time without getting overwhelmed. In some hostile encounters, [[Sentry|Sentries]] can call for a reinforcement [[Assault Squad]]. In the first Caves map each depth only no reinforcements will come as there is no 0b10-controlled exit. Killing the Sentries as quickly as possible is highly recommended in all other cases. Sentries capable of calling reinforcements will only do so when they are both tracking Cogmind and in Cogmind's field of view. Whether the Sentries themselves see Cogmind is irrelevant. Fighting these outposts is a bad idea for an unprepared build, but larger outposts with Terminal intel are very valuable. This intel can be the same as the intel found in [[Derelict Log|Derelict Logs]].
Friendly Derelicts will not move from their guard position, but they will engage any 0b10 forces they see. Leading hostile squads into them can let them do the fighting for you. This is particularly easy to do for fast airborne builds who don't want to engage in combat and can use the Derelicts as a distraction. These Derelicts can also be safely salvaged for parts and will not retaliate.

"Cetus","Location","Cetus is a [[0b10]]-controlled [[Factory]] branch between -6 and -4 that can only be entered through [[Extension]]. This map is the same every game with no variation. There are 2 groups of a [[Watcher]] + 4 [[Cetus Guard|Cetus Guards]]. One is on the bottom left side of the map and the other is on the top right. In the center is the Cetus Manufacturing Module machine, a few scattered lore [[Terminal|Terminals]], and a Terminal that locks up the Cetus Mainframe.
If [[A7]] is rescued and kept alive, they will provide a special Terminal hack for the manufacturing module that will create 5 Cogmind-controlled [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]]. A7 also has a special interaction upon seeing the Cetus Mainframe. After exiting the map, they will give a special robot hack that [[Redacted]]decreases the reaction time of [[MAIN.C]], causing them to take much longer to attack[[/Redacted]].
One special bot appears on this map: [[Revision 17]]. After destroying all 8 Cetus Guards, they will appear and thank Cogmind for freeing them. If both Revision 17 and the Cetus Manufacturing Module are still intact when leaving the map, it is possible to [[Revision 17 (Alignment)|align with them]] and cause a special -3 [[Research]] event where Revision 17 attacks the map.
There are no standard [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]] or [[Assault Squad|Assaults]] on this map. However, there is a special patrol [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] spawn. 750 turns after entering the map and every further 250 turns, 2 ARCs will spawn from random exits and roam around the map. It is best to exit the map before too many of these ARCs start showing up.
[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]
[[Lore]]Cetus Records|Cetus Mainframe[[/Lore]]
[[Heading]]Strategy[[/Heading]]
The [[Cetus Guard|Cetus Guards]] are not too tough of foes and have some very nice loot, especially the [[Adv. KE Penetrator]], [[Centrium Heavy Treads]], [[Centrium Medium Armor Plating]]. They have an above average amount of core integrity but no critical destroy immunity or EM resistance, so destroy crit and EM weapons tend to be the most effective. EM Launchers are particularly effective at taking out each chunk of 4 in a short amount of time. There will be some [[Corrupted Parts|corrupted]] parts, but this loot is definitely worth the corruption. 
Cogmind will often have a big group of allies from Extension. These can be helpful and harmful at the same time. Too many allies will just get in the way of each other and you, so telling some controllable allies to stay back is often a good idea. While the [[Guerrilla (5)|Guerillas]] have -Salvage from their [[Bore Cannon]], they tend to perform very well against the Cetus Guards due to their very high critical destroy chance.
To best preserve the Cetus Manufacturing Module for the A7 code or Revision 17 events, tell all controllable allies to stay at the first intersection after killing the first set of Cetus Guards. This will cause any ARCs that spawn from the top-left exit to fight those allies out of the way. Otherwise|being created via the A7 code will often fight right in front of the module and cause the machine to get destroyed by wandering patrols trying to fight.
The Cetus Mainframe door has a very low base success rate of 10%. While [[Hackware]] can help out here, the Cetus Guards can conveniently drop a [[Adv. Variable Charge Gun]] which can be overloaded to destroy the Sealed Heavy Doors. Otherwise, any rating 3 or higher [[Impact Weapons|Impact Weapon]] can destroy the Reinforced Barrier around it.

[[List]]Main access exits: The exits on the top left/right corners of the map will lead to the next main Factory or Research floor.|[[Archives]]: The exit on the bottom right corner leads to Archives.[[/List]]","Spoiler","","","","",""
"Command","Location","Command is an [[0b10]]-controlled [[Access]] [[Branch]] that only appears on -1. It is the home to [[MAIN.C (Shell)|MAIN.C]], the mastermind AI behind 0b10, and huge groups of his forces. Command features a heavily patrolled dense layout that feels more similar to [[Research]] than [[Access]] with smaller corridors and generally smaller heavily interconnected rooms with Emergency Accesses connecting many rooms. One unique feature of Command is that dispatched squads are not spawned from an exit. Instead, there is a dedicated ""Garrison"" area in the map where bots are dispatched from. This means that unlike most maps, it is possible for Command to run out of squads to send after Cogmind.
The overall structure of Command can be split into 3 groups. The right and left sections are both randomly generated per seed, although there are several fixed features, while the center section is always fixed. The right side is connected to the center section in 3 different places. In the center of the map there is a 5 tile wide corridor typically referred to as the ""Doom Corridor"" that contains multiple unpowered Warlord variations, 2 [[Combat Programmer|Combat Programmers]] and 2 [[M Guard|M Guards]]. Above and below are passages to the ""Garrison"" sections of the map. Each Garrison has a fixed set of bots that are initially present. Above the Doom Corridor are some Sealed Barriers with 80 armor surrounded by Reinforced Barriers with 100, locked by a [[Terminal]] with a 60% base open chance. Past this hall is a large room with a big chunk of machinery called the 0b10 Conduit that is hooked up to MAIN.C. 100 armor Heavy Barriers appear on the bottom left side of this room that block off the left section of Command. The left section will always contain a cache of high rating parts near the top-right or bottom-right side of that section.
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:3]]Phase Generator[[/Heading]]The Phase Generator is an explosive machine with a distinctive look and is always found on the right section of Command. This Phase Generator will block most forms of bot detection and and terrain scanning. [[Sensor Arrays]] except for the [[Active Sensor Suite]], [[Terrain Scanners]], and the [[Structural Scanner]] all do not work in Command unless the Phase Generator is destroyed. [[Farcom]], however, does work even through the Phase Generator. This machine also keeps Phase Walls powered, which look just like normal walls unless destroyed or an 0b10 bot walks into one. These walls disappear when the Phase Generator is destroyed.
[[Heading:3]]Cave Seal[[/Heading]]
Cave Seals are a special type of Terminal that will spawn bots when opened. There are always 2 Cave Seals on the right side of the map. After being opened, large groups of bots will appear roughly 10 turns, 125 turns, 225 turns, and 375 turns after opening. The type of bots depend on various factions and alignments Cogmind has interacted with.
[[Heading:3]]Wave Inhibitor[[/Heading]]
The Wave Inhibitor, only appears on the left section of the map. It will prevent teleportation via the [[Transdimensional Reconstructor|Regular]] and [[Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor|Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructors]]. It also blocks calling for allies when [[Imprint|Imprinted]].

[[Heading:2]]Cave Seal contents[[/Heading]]
The contents of the cave seal depend on alignment. Warlord/Imprint alignment are mutually exclusive and take priority of Core Reset Matrix seals. If no other options apply, wild cave derelicts will appear. For allied seals, some of the bots will follow Cogmind around and others will roam the map randomly.
[[Heading:3]]Warlord seal[[/Heading]]
Warlord seal bots are white colored, meaning that they are allied to Cogmind but do not generate [[Alert]]. Warlord will always come out of the first opened cave seal. They can contain the following bots by default:
[[List]][[Warlord (Command)|Warlord]] (first only)|[[Butcher (7)]]|[[Fireman (7)]]|[[Guerrilla (7)]]|[[Knight]]|[[Marauder (8)]]|[[Martyr (7)]]|[[Mutant (8)]]|[[Savage (7)]]|[[Thug (7)]]|[[Troll]]|[[Wasp (7)]]|[[Wizard (7)]][[/List]]
If Warlord forces have gained a force multiplier by the [[Encrypted Comm Array]] mechanics, more bots and stronger bots will appear from these seals. If the multiplier is high enough, the following bots can additionally be found in these seals:
[[List]][[Dragon]]|[[Hydra]]|[[Surgeon (6)]][[/List]]
[[Heading:3]]Imprint seal[[/Heading]]
Imprint seals contain purple-colored bots which [[I]]will[[/I]] generate Alert for Cogmind. Be careful of alert generation as it is extremely easy to trigger [[High Security]] very soon after opening an Imprint seal. Unlike most purple allies, some of these bots will wander off without following Cogmind. If a Core Reset Matrix has been used prior to opening the seal, any [[Experimental|Experimentals]], [[Z-Light|Z-Lights]], and [[Z-Heavy|Z-Heavies]] will be blue and controllable instead of purple uncontrollable. They can contain the following bots:
[[List]][[Fireman (7)]]|[[Martyr (7)]]|[[Mutant (8)]][[Wizard (7)]]|[[Z-Experimental (8)]]|[[Z-Experimental (10)]]|[[Z-Heavy (9)]]|[[Z-Light (9)]][[/List]]
[[Heading:3]][[Core Reset Matrix]] (CRM) seal[[/Heading]]
CRM seals consist only of [[Golem|Golems]] and [[Assembled (7)|Assembled]]. There is either 0 or 1 Golem per spawn, and about a dozen Assembled each time.
[[Heading:3]]Wild Derelicts[[/Heading]]
Wild Derelict seal bots are brown-colored meaning hostile unaligned Derelicts that do not contribute to Alert. They can contain the following bots:
[[List]][[Butcher (7)]]|[[Fireman (7)]]|[[Guerrilla (7)]]|[[Mutant (8)]]|[[Savage (7)]]|[[Thug (7)]]|[[Wizard (7)]][[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]Command cache contents[[/Heading]]
There are several groups of parts that can appear as part of this cache. There is one special item which contains many otherwise unique [[Testing]]-only parts, and the Gamma Refractor that can't appear anywhere else.
[[Heading:3]]Unique item[[/Heading]]
This unique item appears in the center of the cache:

[[Heading:3]]Gaining Access[[/Heading]]
The door terminal only has a 10% chance of hacking, though this hack is only available while MAIN.C is still alive. Other methods of entry will require bypassing the Sealed Heavy Doors via Spacefold, digging through with strong Thermal damage, or digging through the side with a Matter Drive or Laser Shovel.
[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There are 3 exits on Command maps. All are very uniquely identifiable:
[[List]]Right-side Surface exit: This exit is behind a 4 tile wide doorway on the right side of the map. This exit is extremely heavily guarded, with 2 [[Alpha 7|Alpha 7s]], 2 [[Striker|Strikers]], 2 [[Executioner|Executioners]], and 2 [[B-99 Colossus|Colossi]]. There are also 10 rows of stasis traps and a further layer of stasis traps surrounding the Access Shell that make flying or core hovering through a nightmare. Launchers can be used to destroy the stasis traps without triggering them manually, or a [[Stasis Canceller]] can be used to ignore them altogether. It is usually better to use a strong digging method to dig through the back of the exit to avoid most of the head-on fire.|Left-side Surface exit: This exit is on the left side of the map and can be located by a 2 tile wide corridor dead-ending in it along with Reinforced Barriers surrounding it. There are no guards at this exit.|[[Access_0]] exit: This exit can be found on the far left of the map, past any 0b10 level. There is a [[Dimensional Node Initializer]] activated here, which means that a [[Transdimensional Reconstructor|Regular]] or [[Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor]] will always result in coming to this exit as long as the Wave Inhibitor is destroyed. It is possible to dig to this location, although it will be very painful with many cave-ins and there is no easy way to identify where the exit is.[[/List]]
[[Heading]]MAIN.C[[/Heading]]
MAIN.C is a very unique encounter in the game. Unlike most bots in the game, he has 2 different forms. The [[MAIN.C (Shell)|base form]] is a 3x3 tile slow-moving tank. The [[MAIN.C|second form]] drops down to a 1x1 tile fast hover-bot. Both forms have an ability that regenerates 5 core integrity every turn. He has much state-dependent dialogue, and multiple interactions with different bots in Command.
[[Heading:2]]Fighting[[/Heading]]
MAIN.C will instantly attack when opening the door to his room, then monologue a bit. On defeating the first phase, MAIN.C will typically offer a choice to continue fighting or to surrender. Surrendering will start the process for a W8 [[Wintypes|Wintype]], discussed below. MAIN.C will not offer the surrender option if Cogmind has used a [[Core Reset Matrix]] or if [[Warlord (Command)|Warlord]] is alive and present on the map. If continuing to fight, the Command Garrisons will be activated, leaving the large swathes of Garrison bots to swarm around the map aimlessly. The Doom Corridor guards and the right side exit guards will also be summoned directly to the MAIN.C room, if alive. If MAIN.C is destroyed, a large percentage of all 0b10-aligned bots will turn into a new unaligned faction, hostile to other 0b10 bots. Every 200 turns, more bots will randomly switch between the two factions, continuing to destroy each other. 600 turns after MAIN.C's death, all remaining combat hostiles will turn unpowered.
[[Heading:2]]Warlord interaction[[/Heading]]
If phase one of MAIN.C sees Warlord, he will unpower Warlord permanently. This ability can be avoided in two ways. The first is to destroy phase one of MAIN.C before Warlord comes into view. This is only really possible for an airborne builds that can leave Warlord behind to try and fight phase one before Warlord can catch up. The second way is to use the MAIN.C hack. There are a few turns of wiggle room before Warlord is shut down, so make sure to use this hack via some kind of remote [[Datajacks| Datajack]] immediately on entering the MAIN.C room.
[[Heading:3]]W7: ""Establishing Free Derelict Territories""[[/Heading]]
If MAIN.C is destroyed and Warlord is still alive and has not been unpowered, a W7 will be achieved. Using the MAIN.C hack first makes this wintype much easier to accomplish to stop the unpowering ability.
[[Heading:2]]MAIN.C Hack[[/Heading]]If [[A7]] was rescued in [[Extension]] and his quest to see the [[Cetus]] Mainframe is completed, they will provide the MAIN.C hack. Using this hack has two primary effects. It stops Warlord from being shut down after being spotted and it dramatically slows down MAIN.C's action speed. Every free turn, there is a chance that MAIN.C will be unable to move with the text [[GameText]]MAIN.C reaction time slowed by virus[[/GameText]]. This substantially decreases the amount of damage output, although it doesn't slow down any of the Command Garrison bots from running into the room quickly.
[[Heading:2]]Zhirov[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Command Zhirov.png|Zhirov, Perun, and Svarog arriving to finish off MAIN.C[[/Image]]
If [[Zhirov]]'s SGEMP quest is completed and Zhirov is still alive, he will show up along with [[Perun]] and [[Svarog]] after Cogmind defeats phase one of MAIN.C. A Modified SGEMP will be detonated, unpowering every 0b10-aligned bot on the floor. This also includes Warlord if he is present on the map. After this, Zhirov will remark that there is a lot of cleaning up to do, then he and his friends will teleport out. This does not count as a MAIN.C kill for the run (a + on the scoresheet). However, it does provide a good method to prepare for Access_0 with all of the good loot available and is generally a good way to explore Command.
[[Heading:2]][[Sigix Warrior]]/[[Sigix Exoskeleton]] interaction[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Command Sigix Shell.png|Special MAIN.C phase 2 reinforcements to fight the Sigix[[/Image]]
If Cogmind has activated the Sigix Warrior or has gotten into the Exoskeleton, MAIN.C will be much more prepared for phase 2. In addition to the second phase of MAIN.C himself, there will also be 4 [[M Shell/Atk]] and 4 [[M Shell/Def]] that appear from the outer shell. The Defensive shells are not too much stronger than an average [[Protector]], but the Offensive shells boast a ridiculously strong offensive loadout with many of the best offensive utilities in the game. Fighting them head-on is not an easy task.
[[Heading:2]]W1: ""Establishing 0b11""[[/Heading]]
This wintype can be achieved by destroying both phases of MAIN.C and taking either Surface exit off of the map. If Cogmind has consumed a Core Reset Matrix, a W2 will override this win.
[[Heading:2]]W4: ""Assimilated 0b10""[[/Heading]]
This win can be achieved in one of two ways using the 0b10 conduit that MAIN.C is normally hooked up into. The machine must remain intact in order to achieve this wintype. The first is to destroy both phases of MAIN.C and then stand next to one of the corners of the conduit. If using [[RIF]], MAIN.C does not need to be destroyed. Using RIF is by far the easier technique as the MAIN.C first phase is very slow and easy to lure away by a fast flight build that can hop back over MAIN.C and run into the machine.
[[Heading:2]]W8: ""Fortifying 0b10""/Surrender[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Command EQ-Series.png|[[Enhanced Q-Series]] attacking 0b10[[/Image]]
If the surrender option is chosen after defeating MAIN.C phase one, a different ending will begin. First, all 0b10 bots including MAIN.C will become friendly to Cogmind with the log entry [[GameText]]LRC-V3 rejoined 0b10. Threat protocols amended.[[/GameText]] MAIN.C will give Cogmind complete map intel and say to go stock up in the Command cache, which will open automatically on approach. After 100 moves or approximately 400 turns, another two alerts will indicate [[GameText]]System intrusion detected. Garrison defenses under attack.[[/GameText]] and [[GameText]]All Command Garrisons activated[[/GameText]]. Garrisons be significantly sabotaged, and after 40 more turns, a large group of [[Enhanced Q-Series]] will teleport into random locations on the map. After every 100 turns or so, more waves of Q-Series will spawn in. These bots have randomized loadouts just like regular [[Q-Series]] do, but are much more powerful. MAIN.C will order Cogmind to fight them off. Be careful of Launcher uses and misses/misfires for this event. If 0b10 bots are attacked enough times, MAIN.C will announce Cogmind as a traitor and all 0b10 bots will once again become hostile.
The Enhanced Q-Series waves will go on endlessly without intervention. There is some amount of contribution required to be able to complete the event. The details are not well understood, but participating in kills will move the event closer to completion. Expect between one to two dozen Enhanced Q-Series kills required before the event can be completed. If Cogmind is not contributing enough, when the 4th wave spawns, MAIN.C will tell Cogmind to help out a bit more or else they might lose. After enough kills, MAIN.C will say that the reinforcements seem to have stopped coming and must prepare for the future. This will end the run and result in the W8 ending.
[[Heading]]Getting MAIN.C's + Strategy (defeating MAIN.C)[[/Heading]]
Command is one of the toughest maps in the game and has a lot to prepare for. Since the most challenging encounters on the map are fixed, it is possible to prepare for many things ahead of time. Unlike most maps, combat is not optional in order to win. Cogmind does not necessarily need to do any fighting, although it is always a good idea to be able to meaningfully contribute. However, seal allies can be incredibly strong, and can even kill MAIN.C unaided in some cases.
[[Heading:2]]Seal Strategy[[/Heading]]
Warlord and Imprint seals are the most powerful and have the potential to carry a run through the Doom Corridor and sometimes even through MAIN.C. Since seals have a 0% base success rate, opening them requires some forward planning. A decent stack of [[Hackware]] is all but required to open seals successfully. Killing 0b10 [[Operator|Operators]] can be a good way to stockpile Hackware ahead of time. Destroying one or more Network Hubs in [[Hub_04(d)]] can provide decent defensive hacking bonuses without needing Hackware equipped. Prototype Hackware is very useful here for minimizing the number of utilities that need to be carried around. Other ways to increase hacking capabilities are the [[Terminal]] Trojan(Botnet) hack and the allied Operator bonus.
Locating the Seals can be difficult on some maps. Unless the Phase Generator is destroyed, terrain scanning does not work in Command. It may be worth keeping a [[Terrain Scanners|Terrain Scanner]] around in case of an early Phase Generator. While it does generate 150+ Alert, the ability to search for Seals and potentially use [[Sensor Arrays|Sensors]] to avoid enemy encounters may be a worthy tradeoff. Unfortunately, the [[Machine Analyzer]] does not work on seal Terminals. However, an Index(Terminals) hack will locate all Terminals, including the seals. This narrows down the locations needed to search. Using the [[Data Conduit]] trivializes the search, as all machine intel is given instantly upon entering the map.
Once a seal has been located, there is one choice to make. Use the seal now or fight the Doom Corridor first and come back for the seal for the MAIN.C fight? The answer can depend on the seal type, Alert situation, machine location relative to the Doom Corridor, Cogmind's build, and more. Opening a seal will spawn a large group of allies immediately and allows a few backup waves to spawn over time. This is great to protect Cogmind immediately, although it may not help the Alert situation in the case of Imprint or Core Reset Matrix (CRM) seals if there are a lot of hostiles nearby or if the seal is far away from the Doom Corridor. Large groups of blue or purple allies can skyrocket Alert and trigger [[High Security]] quickly. Warlord allies do not generate Alert themselves, so this is not a problem for that faction. If the seal is far from the Doom Corridor, it may be impractical for Cogmind to defeat the Doom Corridor solo and then make the trek back to the seal and then all the way back to MAIN.C without getting caught up by additional patrols, [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]], and [[Assault Squad|Assaults]]. Prolonged time in Command will cause part attrition to Cogmind and/or a loss of seal allies very quickly. High Security disables the seal machines and the Assault forces will make quick work of any amassed allies with additional [[Demolisher|Demolishers]] being sent along, although already opened seals will not stop spawning allies when the machine network is disabled. If Cogmind is already in good shape to take on the Doom Corridor without assistance, the allies may be better saved for the MAIN.C fight instead.
[[Heading:2]]Doom Corridor Strategy[[/Heading]]
The Doom Corridor is the first major fight of the extended endgame. 2 [[M Guard|M Guards]] and 2 [[Combat Programmer|Combat Programmers]] down a hallway. They can tank very well and deal quite a bit of damage back to Cogmind, so having a plan ahead of time is essential. It is possible to skip fighting Doom Corridor to avoid any combat at this part, but it is not generally recommended because all 4 of the guards will be summoned to aid MAIN.C later on. The vast majority of runs hoping to complete Command will have to fight head-on.
[[Heading:3]]Doom Corridor Skip[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Command Doco Skip.png|One Doom Corridor skip[[/Image]]
Digging past the Doom Corridor requires a strong digging tool that can break through 100 armor tiles, ideally at range. Dig the path shown on the right to safely get past without being spotted. The end of this path results in a 4 tile dig which does have a slight cave-in risk. There is an alternative route that digs directly into the terminal tile and through the Sealed Barrier instead, but this can be even riskier as a poorly timed misfire or misdirect can place Cogmind in a very bad spot. Another alternative skipping solution for airborne builds is to use one or mores [[ECM Suites]] after luring the guards out of the corridor. The idea is to loop the Combat Programmers across the map for a while until the M Guards get sufficiently far out of the way. Then use the ECM Suites on the return trip so they forget about Cogmind. Then simply pass through the corridor up to MAIN.C, forgotten by its guards.
[[Heading:4]]Why skip?[[/Heading]]
There are a few reasons why skipping the guards might be desirable. If going for a W8 [[Wintypes|Wintype]], keeping the Doom Corridor guards alive is very useful for defeating the summoned [[Enhanced Q-Series]]. The more bots destroyed on the way, the fewer guards there are to protect Cogmind and MAIN.C for the hard part of the ending. Another reason could be if [[Zhirov]]'s SGEMP quest has been completed. Zhirov will set off the Modified SGEMP after phase one of MAIN.C is defeated any unpower all bots anyway, so there is not a big benefit in fighting the Doom Corridor first unless there is a good setup for looting the M Guards in hand already. One last reason might be if Cogmind has a very powerful MAIN.C killer, where the guards won't be able to reach Cogmind by the time MAIN.C is dead. This is mostly applicable to the extreme superweapon the [[BFG-9k Vortex Edition]] that can kill MAIN.C in only a few hits.
[[Heading:3]]Doom Corridor Guards[[/Heading]]
The Doom Corridor guards are scary in different ways. The Combat Programmers don't deal quite so much damage but allies can be easily assimilated by their strong hacking ability. They also tend to rack up the Corruption quite quickly on Cogmind. While typically not too game-ending, high corruption will frequently cause minor annoyances that can add up into big problems while in combat at one of the most crucial points in the game. M Guards can deal massive direct damage to Cogmind and any allies around with their powerful launchers. The guards also protect each other with their abilities. M Guards are fairly susceptible to EM attacks, but Combat Programmers will typically cleanse their corruption before Cogmind can get the kill. On the other hand, the M Guards will provide high damage reduction to the Combat Programmers with their [[AEGIS Remote Shield]] that makes them more difficult to kill first.
[[Heading:3]]Useful parts vs Doom Corridor[[/Heading]]
Some specific parts can be especially helpful for conquering the Doom Corridor:
[[Heading:4]][[Antimissile Systems]][[/Heading]]
Most of the damage coming from the M Guards is from their Launchers. A single Antimissile System has a roughly 2/3 chance of shooting down a Launcher shot coming in from >3 range. A second one brings that chance up to about a 90% chance to shoot down Launcher shots. This is a significant damage decrease to Cogmind if fighting solo and is absolutely crucial to keeping large groups of allies alive.
[[Heading:4]][[Exp. EM Disruption Field]][[/Heading]]
Fairly self-explanatory, this part will turn Combat Programmers into largely ignorable nuisances.
[[Heading:4]][[Imp. Shock Absorption System|Imp]]/[[Exp. Shock Absorption System]][[/Heading]]
This is a good alternative to the Antimissile System to cut down Launcher damage taken.
[[Heading:4]][[Graphene Brace]][[/Heading]]
This part is most helpful against [[Graviton Cannon]] M Guards. Blast is a scary mechanic to face, and getting an Antimissile System blasted off immediately into a Launcher hit is the stuff of nightmares. It also helps a little against the Combat Programmer corruption criticals.
[[Heading:4]]Strong Thermal Cannons like [[Enh. Nova Cannon]][[/Heading]]Combat Programmers have a -25% resistance to Thermal damage and strong Cannons are the best way to exploit this. Alternatively, a thermal gun stack with good burn criticals can be used to overheat the bots to death and earn an early kill.
[[Heading:4]]Strong EM Cannons like [[Com. HERF Cannon]][[/Heading]]
After the Combat Programmers are taken down, the M Guards are vulnerable to EM damage. With high resistances all around and an additional 50% damage reduction from AEGIS, EM is the ideal way to kill here. M Guards only have 50% EM resistance, and EM corruption ignores the AEGIS damage reduction entirely. HERF can take down an M Guard in relatively few volleys.
[[Heading:4]][[Core Stripper]]/[[Disintegrator]]/[[Warp Cannon]][[/Heading]]
These weapons can instantly kill any of the Doom Corridor guards. Core Stripper and Disintegrator in particular are great at generating loot. Their energy and heat requirements can be a little tough to deal with though. These are best used by airborne builds that can easily separate the guards from each other for easier looting. Alternatively, allies can be used to draw fire away from Cogmind so that the dropped loot doesn't get beat up by M Guard Launchers.
[[Heading:4]][[Firepult]][[/Heading]]
This part can single handedly melt all of the Doom Corridor bots in only a few volleys, with some lucky hits. If heat dissipation allows, using a Quantum Capacitor can help a lot to overwhelm the Coolant Injectors of the M Guards.
[[Heading:4]][[Vortex Catalyst Activator]][[/Heading]]
This launcher is uniquely good at softening up the Doom Corridor due to dealing Vortex damage, something that none of the bots resist. It may not be able to single handedly kill all the guards due to the limited number of shots it can fire, but it should get most of the way there.
[[Heading:4]][[Microwarp Drive]][[/Heading]]
This part is very strong for slow treaded bots. Either get into line of sight or shoot with a long-ranged weapon to attract attention, then warp out of the corridor to safety. This allows for easily separating the Combat Programmers to destroy them first without any AEGIS protection. The M Guards will take a long time to make their way over.
[[Heading:4]]Defensive [[Hackware]][[/Heading]]
Defensive Hackware will reduce the chances of Combat Programmers being able to hack allies. Very useful if Cogmind has seal allies.
[[Heading:4]][[Energy Wells]][[/Heading]]
Using stored energy to continue firing EM weaponry or to power expensive [[Defensive Utilities]] is always useful in combat.
[[Heading:4]]Traps[[/Heading]]
[[Fire Trap|Fire Traps]] and EM traps like [[EM Surge Trap|EM Surge Traps]] can be used to take out the Combat Programmers and M Guards respectively with little else.
[[Heading:4]][[Relay Coupler [Proto]|Prototype Relay Couplers]][[/Heading]]
A RIF build can assimilate the entire Doom Corridor with enough of these.

[[Heading:3]]Doom Corridor Combat Strategies[[/Heading]]
There are several common Doom Corridor fighting strategies that depend on obtained parts and allies:
[[Heading:4]]Solo Cogmind[[/Heading]]
If Cogmind is fighting alone, it can be very effective to lure the Combat Programmers out first to kill them before the M Guards arrive. A Microwarp Drive makes this very easy to do. Without a Microwarp Drive, one strategy is to use a long ranged [[Ballistic Cannons|Ballistic Cannon]] to shoot one of the M Guards and then duck into one of the Warlord cubbyholes. The Combat Programmers will run out of AEGIS protection range to fight. Ideally, these Programmers will be destroyed by the time the M Guards catch up. If not, it is still good to finish them off before moving to the M Guards. Switch over to EM to quickly finish the M Guards.
[[Heading:4]]Seal Charge[[/Heading]]
If one or more seals have been activated, there can be a large mass of allies following Cogmind around. If grounded and slow, sometimes there are so many allies that no kind of special maneuvering is possible. In this case, charging down the Corridor is the only real choice. If possible, try to use an Antimissile System or two to keep allies alive as long as possible. This strategy usually results in a large percentages of allies getting destroyed in the fight, and often the allies can be totally obliterated. If Warlord is present, he will typically be the last ally standing for this type of strategy. In fact, Warlord alone can end up carrying the entire Doom Corridor fight. He has 100% EM resistance so the Combat Programmers can't hurt at all, and he has a massive amount of integrity to tank the M Guards.
One variant of this strategy is to try to sneak around the top of the Corridor with the intention of Warlord or other allies getting spotted first. This will result in the majority of allies getting Launchered out of existence very quickly, but keeps fire off of Cogmind. The tradeoff here is that it is much easier to sneak in with a Core Stripper or Disintegrator and preserve dropped M Guard loot while Cogmind is not the primary focus of the guards. Otherwise, Cogmind rushing in can result in -salvaged M Guards or existing floor loot being destroyed.
[[Heading:4]]Lure strategy[[/Heading]]
This strategy works best with fast airborne builds and/or with blue CRM-controlled Imprint seals. The general idea is to set up a killzone just outside of the Doom Corridor front doors and lure the guards to that spot. For Imprint, try to separate Experimentals in a way such that multiple Experimentals won't get hit by a single M Guard Launcher hit. If Warlord seals, try to lure the Derelicts back a little ways to give yourself some breathing room before you return. Run or Microwarp in, get the guards to follow you out, then let your allies do their thing. Ideally the M Guards don't make it out until Combat Programmers are dead, and they should suffer the same fate as the Programmers. This works better with a large number of allies, particularly Experimentals or Z-Heavies, and a wide-open area outside of the Doom Corridor. This usually results in much fewer ally casualties due to bots rushing in front of each other and getting in each others' way, blocking LOS and causing missed shots to result in friendly fire. It can be a good idea to hide behind a wall for a bit after luring the guards since they will prioritize Cogmind first and take a while to switch into attacking other hostiles.
[[Heading:4]]Trap strategy[[/Heading]]
This strategy works best with fast airborne builds or tread builds with the Microwarp Drive. Use Fire Traps first to take out the Combat Programmers. 1-2 should result in a heavily disabled or entirely melted down Programmer. A thermal weapon can be used to trigger the full meltdown of a bot in critical range to begin with. After the Programmers are dead, place down any type of EM-damaging or corruption trap. EM Surge Traps work best. 2-3 of these will take down an M Guard alone. Use of a [[Trap Extractors|Trap Extractor]] is helpful to preserve inventory space.
[[Heading:4]]Assimilation strategy[[/Heading]]
Using RIF with Prototype Relay Couplers is an easy way to handle all bots in the Doom Corridor. The full set of Doom Corridor bots can be assimilated at a cost of 42 charges of these couplers. A melee Datajack is useful for the Programmers because they have a high chance of shooting down Remote Datajacks. Lure the Programmers around a corner, assimilate then, then use a Remote Datajack to take care of the M Guards.
[[Heading:3]]Accessing MAIN.C[[/Heading]]
MAIN.C is locked behind a very powerful sealed barrier with 80 armor. The Terminal has a high base success rate of 60% but may not always be available. If Cogmind has hit High Security or if the Terminal is blown up while fighting the Doom Corridor, alternative methods must be used to gain entry. Powerful Thermal weaponry including [[Cld. Nova Cannon]], [[Null Cannon]], [[Potential Cannon]], [[Imp. Potential Cannon]], and [[Core Cannon]] can be used to dig through the center. An high rating reactor explosion from an EM launcher such as the [[Shock Bomb Launcher]] sometimes available on [[Warlord D3-CKR]] can destroy a few wall tiles at a time. [[Plasma Cutters]] can be used to disassemble the Sealed Barrier without much hassle. Another alternative is to skip through the barrier with a [[Spacefold Activator]], or to dig around it using a [[Matter Drive]], [[LU-1G1's Laser Shovel]], or [[Terrabomb]].
[[Heading:2]]MAIN.C Strategy[[/Heading]]
After bypassing the Doom Corridor in one way or another, the big boss MAIN.C lies ahead. The first form is the easier of the two. It is easier to hit, has weaker weapons, lacks some resistances that the second phase has, and has no strict timer. The second phase is much scarier. This form deals much more damage, has a 20% blast from the [[Omega Cannon]], gains Thermal and Explosive resistance, becomes much quicker at 34 speed, and most importantly, puts Cogmind on a time limit due to activating all of the Command Garrisons.
[[Heading:3]]Useful parts vs MAIN.C[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:4]]Strong Kinetic, Entropic, or Vortex weapons[[/Heading]]
Phase two is 75% resistant to Thermal damage and Explosive damage, and 100% EM resistant. That only leaves melee weapons and the aforementioned ranged damage types capable of realistically taking him down. While superweapons or allies can help take him down easily, 4 [[Linear Accelerator|Linear Accelerators]] backed with offensive utilities is enough to win. Some other good weapon choices are: [[Hcl. Linear Accelerator]], [[Multirail]], [[Graviton Cannon]], [[Omega Cannon]], [[Zio. Phaser-H]], [[Zio. Alpha Cannon]], [[Zio. Alpha Cannon Mk. II]], [[Vortex Cannon]], [[Vortex Driver]], [[Vortex Rifle]], [[Vortex Shotgun]], [[Sigix Sheargun]], and [[Sigix Shearcannon]].
[[Heading:4]][[BFG-9k Vortex Edition]][[/Heading]]
This unique weapon deserves a special mention of its own. This will always kill with 2 core hits, and even guarantee the kill with a single [[Adv. Particle Charger]].
[[Heading:4]][[L-Cannon]][[/Heading]]This weapon is also very unique. The completed L-Cannon is capable of killing MAIN.C in a single hit, and with good aim, can even destroy both phases in a single volley. Due to MAIN.C's fixed location and the L-Cannon's unique infinite range, it is possible to camp out in the corner of the map and destroy phase one safely out of sight. If MAIN.C survives into phase two, Cogmind can just wait around until he comes into range to finish the job.
[[Heading:4]][[Graphene Brace]] (MAIN.C)[[/Heading]]
Phase 2's 20% blast from the Omega Cannon can blast parts off of Cogmind, causing wasted time re-equipping parts or destruction of critical utilities. Graphene brace completely negates this risk.
[[Heading:4]][[Imp. Utility Shielding|Imp.]] or [[Exp. Utility Shielding]][[/Heading]]
These will protect vital utilities and also protect utility parts from getting blasted by phase two.
[[Heading:4]]A strong Launcher[[/Heading]]
while MAIN.C himself is highly resistant to Launchers, the Garrison ARCs can wander into the room and drop a bunch of bots on top of Cogmind. It can be worth swapping to a Launcher to finish off that group before switching back to MAIN.C.
[[Heading:4]]Chance to hit core utilities[[/Heading]]
Specifically, [[Core Analyzer|Regular]] or [[Exp. Core Analyzer]] and [[Imp. Armor Integrity Analyzer|Imp.]] or [[Exp. Armor Integrity Analyzer]]. The Core and Armor Integrity Analyzers are very effective utilities at reducing kill time. Since killing MAIN.C quickly is the highest priority, these utilities are greatly appreciated to cut down time to kill. Killing quicker also has a stacking effect. The less time MAIN.C is alive, the less time he has to regenerate core, and the fewer overall core damage is required.
[[Heading:4]]Kinetic resistance[[/Heading]]
For example, [[Adv. Focal Shield|Adv.]] or [[Exp. Focal Shield]] or [[Med. Reactive Plating|Med.]] or [[Hvy. Reactive Plating]]. Being able to cut down on the kinetic damage dealt by phase two can help a lot.
[[Heading:4]]Any Remote [[Datajacks|Datajack]][[/Heading]]
The A7 MAIN.C hack can only be delivered with a manual hack performed with a Datajack.
[[Heading:4]][[Energy Wells]] (MAIN.C)[[/Heading]]
Powering Force Fields or expensive Energy Cannons can require a lot of energy, and storing some in advance is always helpful. Consider pre-dropping energy wells so that energy is available when needed.
[[Heading:4]][[Matter Compressors]] or [[Tractor Beams]][[/Heading]]
Kinetic Cannons will eat up huge chunks of stored matter. Without a good way to replenish it mid-combat, Cogmind can run out of matter entirely. Phase one will typically drop a large amount of matter that can be gathered mid-combat with a Tractor Beam. Matter Compressors do a good job of storing matter ahead of time.
[[Heading:3]]MAIN.C Combat Strategies[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Command Warlord Seal MC Attack.png|Charging MAIN.C with Warlord Cave seal allies[[/Image]]
There are not too many strategies for killing MAIN.C. The majority of the work is going to be in the initial setup and not necessarily in the actual fight. The typical course of action is to step into the room, use the MAIN.C hack (if obtained this run), take a few steps into the room, and [[Siege Mode|siege]] up if wearing Treads. After that just start shooting. Phase one can be destroyed with thermal weapons to preserve matter for Kinetics or integrity for Vortex weaponry. When phase one is almost destroyed, it can be worth pre-switching to the phase two build to ensure minimum delay between phase two summoning the Garrisons and MAIN.C dying.
[[Heading:3]]Post-kill[[/Heading]]
After the kill, a large portion of the 0b10 forces will begin to turn on each other. However, it is not safe yet as both 0b10 factions will still try to fight Cogmind. Grab whatever loot there is from MAIN.C (make sure to grab the [[MAIN.C Data Core]]) and decide what to do next. If Warlord is still alive, getting within line of sight of him will result in a W7 ""Establishing Free Derelict Territories"" win. Otherwise, there are two main options here:
[[Heading:4]]Hide in the MAIN.C room[[/Heading]]
Digging through the machinery to hide in the corners of the room can avoid getting spotted by the remaining 0b10 forces. This is most effective with a weapon that can dig into the 100 armor Reinforced Barriers around the room. Otherwise, the machinery tends to get destroyed over time and Cogmind will eventually become exposed. Digging and hiding in the walls, however, is very safe. Either way, just wait out the 600 turns until all of the remaining bots are disabled.
[[Heading:4]]Heading to the left side of Command[[/Heading]]
There are usually a few 0b10 bots wandering around the left side. Usually a little fighting is required to head this way. However, hiding out in one of the corners on the left side here is typically much safer than trying to hide in the corners of the MAIN.C room without being able to properly dig. There is a much smaller chance of wandering bots discovering your hiding spot. The Command cache is a great safe spot to hide in.
If surrounded by a lot of hostiles, one potential strategy is to drop all parts except for the propulsion and try to return later. Core hovering while running away is a good way to escape most of the bots to the left side of Command.
After the bots are disabled, there are two more options to take. Either take one of the surface exits now, or break the Wave Inhibitor machine, loot the map, and teleport to Access_0. If going to Access_0, there is plenty of good loot on the ground or still on unpowered bots. Some of the nicer targets for looting are [[Executioner|Executioners]], [[Alpha 7|Alpha 7s]], [[B-99 Colossus|Colossi]], and both forms of MAIN.C. The Command cache also has plenty of strong prototype parts that will help out.
[[Heading]]W8: ""Fortifying 0b10"" Strategy[[/Heading]]
If the surrender option is selected instead of continuing to fight, Cogmind must face off against waves of Enhanced Q-Series. These bots are mostly randomized, but there are some common qualities to them. They all have [[Adv. Dynamic Insulation System|Adv. Dynamic Insulation Systems]], so EM is not a very effective way to kill. They will typically have another damage resistance utility or armor, although Kinetic and Thermal damage is usually pretty effective. A 4+ Kinetic Cannon or [[Multirail]] stack is a good set to deal a lot of damage to these Q-Series. The overall build requirements tend not to be too strict here. As long as Cogmind can put out a decent amount of damage and manage to keep a build well intact from backup parts and from Q-Series or 0b10 bot loot and MAIN.C doesn't wander off and get overwhelmed, this wintype is not too difficult.
One consideration when doing this event is whether or not to go to the cache. Since Cogmind only gets 100 moves and about 40 more turns after that, it may be worth calculating the path ahead of time. If MAIN.C gets overwhelmed in the first fight, single-handedly fighting a large group of Q-Series, the event can end in failure right at the very beginning. A Microwarp Drive can help greatly here since one warp only counts as one move for the purposes of the timer.
[[Heading:2]]Useful parts vs. Enhanced Q-Series[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:3]]Antimissile Systems (Enh. Q-Series)[[/Heading]]
Some of the Enhanced Q-Series carry powerful Launchers that are best blocked by a utility.
[[Heading:3]]Tractor Beams[[/Heading]]
There aren't typically a lot of turns to spend running around collecting matter in this event. Being able to restock remotely can help save a lot of time and damage dealt to Cogmind.
[[Heading:3]]Matter Compressors/Energy Wells[[/Heading]]
Resource storage is always useful here.
[[Heading:3]]Launchers[[/Heading]]
While these should be used sparingly to avoid friendly 0b10 fire that can cause a betrayal, sometimes large groups of Enhanced Q-Series will wander into the MAIN.C room at about the same time. It is very nice to be able to attack these groups simultaneously.
[[Heading:3]][[Phasing AFG]]/[[Portable AFG]][[/Heading]]
Drawing loot piles closer to Cogmind can also save a lot of otherwise wasted time trying to travel a long distance to get some good loot.","Redacted","","","","",""
"DSF","Location","DSF (Distributed Storage Facility) is a [[0b10]]-controlled sub-floor in [[Factory]] and [[Research]] branches that appears in all depths from -7 through -2. It can only be entered by hacking open a DSF entrance terminal (base 50% chance) without being spotted by any hostiles on the map. DSFs contain large amounts of non-[[Prototype Part|Prototype]] parts in groups of 2-6 that can be any part that can normally appear on the ground for the given depth. Unlike most maps, the ambient temperature in DSFs is -10 rather than 0. This has the effect of giving an additional 10 heat dissipation per turn to all bots on the map.
The overall map layout is semi-fixed. It consists of 2-4 quadrants connected by 2-tile wide corridors In the corner of each quadrant are large Matter Repository machines that will release [[Matter]] when broken. These corridors can have [[Alarm Trap|Alarm Traps]] and [[Stasis Trap|Stasis Traps]] in them but not in the item stockpiles. The exit will never be in the quadrant that Cogmind starts in. In the center of every DSF is a depth-appropriate [[Heavy]], guarding all of the main corridors in the map. Around the Heavy are 4 unpowered [[A-15 Conveyor|A-15 Conveyors]]. The corners of the map can have individual dormant [[Specialist|Specialists]], but not always. There are sometimes groups of 4 prototypes hidden behind emergency access doors in the center of a quadrant, and these prototypes will typically be out-of-depth. Sometimes there is a [[Sentry]] guarding this prototype stockpile.
[[Lore]]0b10 Records|DSF[[/Lore]]
[[Heading]]Mechanics[[/Heading]]
The Heavy in the center of the map makes nearly the entire map relatively unsafe. Although there are no patrols initially, walking through the DSF will quickly get some standard Heavy [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcements]] called on Cogmind. These reinforcements behave no differently than an normal map.
[[Heading:2]]Additional Patrols[[/Heading]]On top of the standard Heavy reinforcements, there are other ways to summon additional patrols. These patrols come in the form of 3 [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]] carrying other bots inside, spaced roughly 80 turns apart. These patrols will come one at a time and remain on the map permanently unless destroyed. These additional patrols can be summoned in one of 3 ways:
[[List]]The Heavy summoning reinforcements: When Cogmind is detected via the Heavy's active scanning, additional patrols will be summoned shortly after.|Terrain destruction: Patrols will be summoned if any of the walls of the DSF are destroyed by any means.|Alarm trap: Patrols will be summoned if an alarm trap is triggered and not jammed using a [[Transmission Jammer]].[[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]Rapid Sterilization[[/Heading]]
After killing around 10 hostiles on the map, rapid sterilization will be engaged. 20 turns after this announcement the ambient heat will rise by 10 and continue to raise by another 10 every 15 turns. This will happen until Cogmind exits the map. This also enables the [[Encrypted Comm Array]] to spawn in the next [[Caves]] if Cogmind does not have a conflicting faction.

[[List]](++) Derelict assault group on entry: A group of [[Derelict|Derelicts]] are present on entering the map next to Cogmind. These bots will charge the center of the map, try to kill the heavy, and continue on toward the exit. If any Derelicts survive, they will continue through the exit and show up on the next map.|(++) Derelict assault enters after Cogmind: Similar to the previous event, bots will trickle one at a time onto the map and then wander around the map instead of heading directly toward the exit.|(++) Derelict assault in progress: A much larger Derelict attack force fights a large number of 0b10 bots. This can include prototype 0b10 and Warlord bots, such as [[Striker|Strikers]] and [[Hydra|Hydras]].|(~) Sapper sabotage: 2 [[Sapper|Sappers]] will appear at the start of the map with lots of [[Sapper Charge|Sapper Charges]] on the ground. Large explosions will follow the 2 bots through the map as they head for the exit. For slower propulsion types, do not slow down or else the high damage explosions will reach you.|(~) [[Assembled (4)|Assembled]] infestation: Assembled will appear behind the emergency access doors with a cache of prototype items and roam around the map. They will continue to spawn in greater waves and attack everything in sight. Up to two [[Demolisher]] response squads will be summoned to deal with them.|(~) Wild Derelict Assault: Wild (and hostile) cave Derelicts will attack the DSF from the exit and roam around the map. They will attack 0b10 and Cogmind-allied bots alike.[[/List]]
[[Heading]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There is only one exit in each DSF. Most of the time the exit leads to the next main floor, although it can occasionally lead into a [[Garrison]] on the current depth. If leading to a Garrison, the Garrison exit will not loop back to the same depth again.","","","","","",""
"Data Miner (Location)","Location","The Data Miner location is a [[Caves]] [[Branch]] that appears on either -7 or -6 and is home to the eponymous bot the [[Data Miner]] aka DM. There are no initially hostile bots, but if Data Miner is attacked or the Data Conduit machine is broken he will trigger a trap door to leave the map and 4 dormant [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]] hidden in the walls will wake up and become hostile. If you have any [[Corruption]], make sure to detach all ranged weapons to avoid accidental misfires.
There are 4 unique Terminals on the bottom side of the map. The left 2 contain mostly lore records, although the top-left Terminal will also list the depth of [[Section 7]] as well as the access code to the [[Warlord (Location)|Warlord]] Prototype Stash. These two vary per run so make sure to grab these lore entries every time. The bottom ones do not contain any additional information each run. The top-right Terminal will contain several random bot [[Schematic|Schematics]] and the bottom-right Terminal will contain a large number of part schematics and a few Prototype ID Banks. The part schematics will always contain schematics for [[Combat Drone Bay]] and [[Lgt. Regenerative Plating]].
[[Heading]]Alignment[[/Heading]]
Talking with the Data Miner will result in a permanent alignment bonus that does not have any incompatibilities. [[Investigation Squad|Investigations]] and [[Assault Squad|Assaults]] on all [[0b10]]-controlled floors have a 50% chance to be redirected to another random place on the map if Cogmind is determined as needing assistance. For Assaults, this will result in their permanent repositioning. This is a benefit most of the time, although on cramped maps it can be a downside because bots can be grouped together at chokepoints. However, this effect can only occur if Cogmind's build is in a generally poor state. Additionally, several door terminals will automatically open with the Log message [[GameText]]Door Terminal flashes as you approach.[[/GameText]] This will happen at all of the locked cells in [[Extension]] as well as locked entrance Terminal prefabs to Extension, [[Quarantine]], and all 3 [[Command]] entrance Terminals.
[[Heading:2]]Data Conduit[[/Heading]]
There is a second secret alignment to this map. After the Data Miner is attacked and either destroyed or trap-doored off the map it is possible to step into and use his Data Conduit machine. Doing so will provide many benefits and some major penalties. The rewards are:

The upsides are quite strong but the downsides are very deadly to all but the most prepared Cogmind. [[Tracker|Trackers]] can easily chew up any airborne build with their deadly [[Immobilizer]] to halt any chance of escape with their highly accurate [[Linked Autogun]] to put out the damage. Adequately prepared combat builds can usually dispatch the Trackers without too much trouble and use their Linked Autoguns to great effect. Each Tracker will also summon a [[Combat Programmer]] which is a high-damaging foe that will quickly rack up corruption. Unlike [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]], Intercepts are move-based and not tile-based and tends to punish airborne builds relatively more than combat builds. When using the Data Conduit, Cogmind should either be prepared to exit maps quickly to avoid Intercept encounters or have a plan to fight.
[[Heading]]Fighting[[/Heading]]
Killing the Data Miner himself is highly luck based with only a few ways to improve the chances. A successful Data Miner kill can yield up to 4 pieces of Prototype Hackware at an early depth. Ranged weapons are almost entirely out of the question because he will escape after the first weapon in a volley. However, melee weapon follow-ups will not cause the trap door to activate in between the volley. The primary ways to increase kill chance are to:
[[List]]Use as many weapon slots with melee weapons as possible|Use [[Actuator Arrays]] to increase followup chance|Use [[Core Analyzers]] to increase core hit chance|Use [[Momentum]] to increase damage|Use [[Force Boosters]] to increase damage[[/List]]

[[Image]]Data Miner Combat Dig.png|Digging through the Data Conduit to fight Grunts[[/Image]]
After the Data Miner is attacked these grunts hidden in the wall will burst out and become aggressive. These Grunts have some nice loot for the depth, particularly their [[Neutron Cannon]], [[Adv.

These can often be found in caves by looting [[Minesweeper|Minesweepers]].|Use 2 or more [[Launchers]] and fight them all at once. Explosive launchers will be slower and provide little to no loot but can have a nice range advantage over the Grunts' below average 14 range.

This is the best tactic to fight Grunts with melee or conventional non-launcher methods.[[/List]]
Another approach is to simply run from the Grunts. This works best for airborne builds as they can get in and out with the fewest number of shots. Digging a tunnel through the Data Conduit machine is also very helpful for escaping. Luring the Grunts into a tunnel as you escape out the other end can avoid most attacks. Flight can hop over the grouped-up Grunts and dodge into the spawn areas to avoid more shots","Spoiler","","","","",""
"Exiles (Location)","Location","The Exiles map appears as a [[Branch]] off of [[Mines]] on either -10 or -9 and is home to the Exiles, a group of friendly Derelict Tinkerer outcasts made up of [[EX-BIN]], [[EX-DEC]], [[EX-HEX]], and their bodyguard [[8R-AWN]]. These Exiles have a large collection of unique prototype parts that are only available in the Exiles vault. The entrance is guarded by some rigged engines that blow up when a hostile bot crosses them. There are some lore terminals with entries written by each of the tinkerers that describe many of the prototype parts obtainable on this map as well as some that are not. The terminal near the center of the map also contains a log entry that points to the depth that [[Zion]] is on. Various caches of storage units and energy/matter storage can be found throughout the map. ""The Gauntlet"" at the bottom of the map is a stretch of tester bots that are working on the latest batch of prototype parts. These Derelicts have names that reference Cogmind community members. This map is also home to the [[Farcom]] aligner machine and a unique alignment.
Carrying a [[Datajack]] into this map can be a good idea due to all of the prototype parts that the Exiles and 8R-AWN have on them. Parsing them will provide the associated prototype part IDs so you can recognize the parts later.
Be wary of [[Corruption]] on this map. There is rarely any way to cleanse corruption this early in the game, and misfires are possible at even 1% corruption. One misfire hitting the wrong thing will result in the whole map turning aggressive and death will likely follow. Detaching all ranged weapons is recommended if Cogmind has any corruption.
[[Heading]]Alignment[[/Heading]]
Using the [[Farcom]] machine grants an 18-radius permanent combat hostile sensor in any [[0b10]] controlled maps and one of the special vault items. If Farcom abilities are retained, entering any [[Research]] branches will have massive consequences. Other than that, Farcom can provide some great advantages to help players with permanent itemless sensor abilities.
3 random items will be present in the vault in most games from the [[Exiles Vault Prototypes]] list. However, 3 [[Deploy-a-Sentry]] and 2 [[Potential Leg]] will appear instead of just one.
[[Heading:2]]Alignment Options[[/Heading]]
There are more ways to interact with Farcom without just taking a single vault item. Here are all of the outcomes:[[List]]Use Farcom machine, take 0-1 vault items: Permanently gain Farcom and the use of the vault item taken.|Use Farcom machine, take 2-3 vault items: Gain Farcom until [[Factory]] is reached. After that, the Exiles notice that you are a thief and will remove Farcom.

They will prioritize high rating parts and Exiles prototypes.|Use Farcom machine (or don't), attack Exiles and leave the map with 0 vault items: Lose Farcom instantly. The Exiles will become aggressive and send [[Assembled (4)|Assembled]], a [[DAS Turret]], and [[8R-AWN]] to kill you. After leaving the map, there is a chance that a hostile [[Z-Hero]] will spawn and attack you. Note: Using vault items on the map is safe as long as no items actually leave the map.|Use Farcom machine, attack Exiles and leave the map with 1 or more vault items: The same as above except you get Master Thieves in caves as described above.[[/List]]
[[Heading]]Variations[[/Heading]]
There are several variations of the Exiles map that can change things dramatically. In the majority of maps, the Exiles are present. However, there are 2 possible variations in the maps:
[[Image]]Exiles Attacked.png|Attacked Exiles vault[[/Image]][[List]]Abandoned Exiles: In this map, the Exiles have all fled the map and taken nearly everything on the map as well.

[[Heading]]Fighting[[/Heading]]
Fighting the Exiles is a challenging yet rewarding endeavor. Although they are normally friendly, they can pack quite a punch and will likely end the run of any unprepared player. As far as rewards go, [[8R-AWN]] has some powerful unique [[8R-AWN's Boregun|Boreguns]] with a high salvage and destroy critical %, out-of-depth parts including [[Exp. Heat Sink]], [[Adv. Weapon Cycler]], [[Exp. Targeting Computer]], and [[Adv. Myomer Leg]]. Another unique part, the [[AS-neutralizer No. 17b]] is very helpful in a later game branch [[Zion Deep Caves]]. Other useful parts on some of the Exiles themselves are [[Adv. Component Analysis Suite]], [[System Purifier]], [[Cmb. Antigrav System]], [[Imp. Armor Integrity Analyzer]], [[Exp. Core Analyzer]], and [[Adv. Transmission Jammer]].
[[Image]]Exiles Kill Build.png|Example Exiles kill build[[/Image]]
Fighting the Exiles is not recommended on -10 due to lower slot count, lower core integrity, and difficulty in getting enough integrity to survive the 8R-AWN fight. If fighting on -9, evolving a 3rd weapon slot can be very effective in killing 8R-AWN and any potential [[Z-Hero|Z-Heroes]] that might spawn in the next Mines map. The third weapon slot is not required to kill by any means, however, and any combination of weapon, utility, and propulsion slots for the evolve will work. As a basic checklist, the following parts are recommended:[[List]]Multiple kinetic guns with backups, ideally [[Hvy. Assault Rifle|Hvy. Assault Rifles]] or [[Imp. Assault Rifle|Imp.

IMPORTANT: Do not install more than one trap until after the attack has begun. Exiles will give a warning if a trap is installed, and immediately turn on Cogmind if a second is installed.|(Optional) [[Thief Drone Bay]] trivializes the 8R-AWN fight. Make sure that you have aggro (he is shooting you), then release the drones. They will rip off parts very quickly and leave them defenseless.[[/List]]
[[Image]]Exiles Kill.png|A visual guide to killing the Exiles[[/Image]]
There are some things that should be done before actually doing the fight itself. The image on the right serves as a visual reference. Any rigged engines used must be in inventory before attacking the Exiles, otherwise the engines will still remain loyal to the Exiles and explode only on Cogmind. Matter pods should be relocated near the 8R-AWN fighting spot (See point #4 in diagram) to avoid running out of matter in combat. Any allies should be told to stay in the same general area so they can contribute to the fight. However, Grunts can't deal much damage until [[8R-AWN's Armor/TH]] is destroyed. Finally, some vault items may come in handy for the fight. The [[Cloak of Protection]]'s effect is not so strong, but when turned off it is a high coverage high integrity piece of armor. The [[Longsword +1]] is a very effective kill tool. The [[Potential Leg|Potential Legs]] have a lot of integrity in case you run out of propulsion during the fight. The [[Gui. Plasma Cannon]] may be used to safely destroy the [[DAS Turret]] without getting attacked back. One thing to consider about the vault is that there may be a 0b10 attack on the Exiles after exiting. In those cases, an Exiles kill may either have to be cancelled or at least turned into a 8R-AWN only kill. Aside from that, the fight may begin:
[[Image]]Exiles Launcher DAS.png|Launchering the DAS turret[[/Image]]
[[List:Ordered]]Shoot one of the spike-shaped machines to turn the Exiles hostile.|Drop the rigged engines from the entrance every few tiles while walking toward the spot for step #3, they have an explosion radius of 2. This will take care of most of the Assembled that are coming your way. IMPORTANT: This must be done after the Exiles become hostile. If you do it before that, they will explode on Cogmind.|Pull out a Launcher and dispose of the remaining Assembled.|Go to the corner to fight 8R-AWN. If you have any blade traps, now is the time to use them. Place them just above the bottom-most wall to the right of the spot marked 4. This is the part that needs the most backups, as 8R-AWN will destroy many of your parts very quickly due to high damage and high part destroy critical chance. Always put on backup parts right away after they are destroyed.You may run out of matter and have to refill from matter pods at this point, which is why preemptively moving the matter pods here can be very important. Many kill attempts that don't have enough damage or integrity will end here.|Hopefully you have some good loot after 8R-AWN is destroyed. [[8R-AWN's Boregun|Boreguns]] are a very easy way to destroy the [[DAS Turret]]. Penetrate through the machines to try and kill the turret without getting shot at because the cannon deals incredibly high damage. If no Boreguns were dropped, using a launcher is another good option. The idea is to aim around the spike in the machine so that you can't get hit but the explosion radius will still hit the turret.|Finally, all that is left is to loot the Exiles and their Derelict friends. Otherwise just finish them off with whatever you have left. Watch out for [[EX-DEC]] as they have a deadly [[AWS/EX-DEC]] that can deal a lot of damage very quickly if you aren't careful. It has a short range, so just take them out from a distance.[[/List]]","","","","","",""
"Extension","Location","Extension is an [[0b10]]-controlled [[Factory]] [[Branch]] that appears between -6 and -4 and serves as a connection between the main [[0b10]] complex and [[Cetus]]. It is the beginning of a 4-map sequences of branches that spans Extension, Cetus, [[Archives]], and [[Hub_04(d)]]. It is an 0b10-controlled map with a small amount of patrols and moderate amount of guards spread throughout. There are a large amount of non-combat hostiles moving in between [[Transfer Station|Transfer Stations]] at the left and right-most parts of the map. Unlike most 0b10-controlled maps, [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]] will not spawn in Extension. The central area is heavily guarded with 2 [[Behemoth|Behemoths]] and 2 [[Sentry|Sentries]] standing by.
The overall map shape is similar to a large B turned on its side. This map shape is the same between runs, although every map has random contents. There is a single bottom path that runs straight to the main Factory/Cetus exits and 2 branching paths that contain some machines and disabled and imprisoned [[Derelict|Derelicts]]. One special NPC, [[A7]], is nearly always guaranteed to be locked in one of the cells. The central area has the aforementioned guards stationed as well as a [[Terminal]]-locked exit. The bottom path to either side of the central area can have Emergency Access doors along the top or bottom of the path. These can contain hostile guards, part caches, or nothing.
One unique mechanic to Extension is the persistent threat check. If too many non-combat hostiles are attacked and destroyed, an alert with the text [[GameText]]ALERT: Persistent threat to transfer network, dispatching additional forces.[[/GameText]] will appear, and 2 [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]] will be dispatched to patrol the map.
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
There are two types of special machines in Extension. The first, the Transfer Station, is a machine that normally transports non-combat hostiles. When destroyed, each one will reduce the number of non-combat robots on all 0b10-controlled maps by a stacking 50% amount. Note that this does not include [[Researcher|Researchers]]. The other, Energy Cyclers, will open all Sealed Heavy Doors simultaneously when destroyed and summon several ARCs to patrol the map. This will free all of the locked up Derelicts and they will start heading in Cogmind's direction, fighting every hostile they see. Destroying either of these machines can be either good or bad, although the energy cycler effect is almost always bad.
[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]
[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Extension[[/Lore]]
[[Heading]]Strategy[[/Heading]]The strategy for Extension is a fairly simple one. From the spawn location, take the path to the top-left of the map. Travel along the right and destroy any hostiles. Rewiring and freeing bots in cells is an option at this point, but it is usually better to wait to do this to keep [[Alert]] lower and to preserve ally integrity for the center fight. When you reach the center area where the only path is down, there are 2 primary options:
[[List]]Head back and loop back around counter-clockwise to the center of the map. Free/rewire any allies along the way. Take on the first Behemoth alone, then keep moving forward with your allies to finish the rest of the center area off.|Dig through the top-center part of the map. This is about 10 tiles long and is a risky dig with a high chance of one or more cave-ins. For a build with no allies and no good way to take on the central area, this may be a better risk to take than a head-on fight.[[/List]]
After that, clear the top right section of the map to collect as many allies as possible, then head to the exits.

[[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]
[[List]](++) Derelict attack: There is an extremely rare event in which a large group of Derelicts attack Extension. The trigger conditions for this event are unknown.[[/List]]","Spoiler","","","","",""
"Factory","Location","Factory is a [[0b10]]-controlled main floor that occurs on every floor between -7 and -4. It is the beginning of the midgame where the game really starts to open up. In stark contrast with earlier [[Materials]] maps, Factory start out huge with a ~200x200 tile map size. The rooms, the corridors, and the overall layout are all much wider and more open and connected than Materials. The patrols and guards are more spread out and stealth play with airborne propulsion and [[Infowar]] becomes a strong gameplay option.
[[Alert]] starts to be more of a concern as the maps become bigger and harder to traverse. [[Hackware]] is useful to be able to successfully use Access hacks at terminals to locate exits. [[Signal Interpreter|Signal Interpreters]] will also be more useful at identifying exits as the exit types will be less predictable. [[Caves]] exits are available in every Factory map. They can be difficult if a player is unprepared, but they can provide many unique rewards and will typically result in a complete Alert purge by the time Cogmind makes it back to the next main floor.
As [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]] become a regular occurrence, a large part of a build's effectiveness becomes how quickly Cogmind can kill Programmers. [[Corruption]] can build up very quickly if fighting multiple Programmers in open areas without a good way to kill them. Having strong thermal or kinetic weaponry is a good way to destroy them quickly. For lighter airborne builds, non-Impact melee weapons can work, although using Hackware to recall Exterminations is also very effective. This tends to be more important in later depths as Exterminations will upgrade from a single [[P-60 Hacker]] to 1-2 [[P-70 Sage]] per squad.
There are many new mechanics introduced beginning in Factory floors:

[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There are 4 types of main exits on Factory floors:
[[List]]Main access exits: These always lead to the next main floor, either Factory or [[Research]]. Sometimes these exits can be identifiable by a 5 tile wide corridor leading to a dead-end with the exit in the middle. All other types of exits that aren't a part of a prefab can be either a main or branch exit. There will always be 4 of these exits per Factory map.|[[Caves]] exit: These exits can never be identified purely by looks. Using a [[Signal Interpreter]] or access hack to identify exits are the main ways to do so. There will always be 2 of these exits per Factory map.|[[Spoiler]][[Extension]] exit: Extension can always be identified by a distinctive prefab where a large area is sealed off by orange Blast Doors. These doors can be open or locked. If locked, the nearby [[Terminal]] will have an Open hack available to open the doors. Otherwise, shooting the walls open with strong thermal weaponry, causing an engine detonation with an EM launcher, or strong melee attacks can dig through or around these doors. Factory maps at the same depth as Extension will have 2 Extension exits.[[/Spoiler]]|[[Spoiler]][[Armory]] exit: Armory can always be identified in Factory by a large 5 tile corridor leading into a 3 tile doorway. These exits will always be heavily guarded by a mix of [[Y-72 Warden|Sentries]] and [[G-67 Veteran|Grunts]] and have large stockpiles of weapons nearby. Factory maps at the same depth as Armory will have 1 of these types of exit.[[/Spoiler]][[/List]]
[[Image]]Factory DSF Exit.png|Hacked open DSF exit[[/Image]]
Several non-standard exits also appear in Factory. [[Chute Trap|Chute Traps]] will throw Cogmind into [[Wastes]] which can end many good runs if unprepared. Using a [[Datajack]] on a [[K-01 Serf|Serf]] for the find_chute hack is very effective to either reveal traps to avoid or areas to head toward if planning to take on the [[C-40 Crusher|Crushers]] in combat. The other type of exit is a [[DSF]]. These exits can be hacked open at distinctive DSF terminals but will automatically lock upon being spotted by any hostile. Stealth or good luck is required to make it to these exits.","","","","","",""
"Garrison","Location","Garrison is a [[0b10]]-controlled sub-floor available from all main maps and several 0b10 branches from -9 to -1. It can only appear on -9 as a [[Storage]] Garrison, but can appear in [[Materials]] starting at -8, [[Factory]], [[Research]], and [[Access]]. Other branches that can have Garrison entrances on them are [[Hub_04(d)]], [[Testing]], [[Quarantine]], and [[Section 7]]. Garrisons are very combat hostile-dense maps, with a few patrols and a large number of guard posts that will automatically open to reveal their contents if Cogmind or an ally is nearby.
Every Garrison has a center square area with 4 guard ""checkpoints"" and is often guarded by a [[Behemoth]]. There are 4 wings of the Garrison extending past the center area dividing into the top left, top right, bottom right, and bottom left segments of the map. Each wing that Cogmind did not spawn in contains an exit, although exits may be locked if Cogmind is not [[RIF]]-aligned. The wings have many random variations that can contain part stockpiles, rewirable bots, Phase Generators, Garrison Relays, trapped Derelicts, and additional guards. At least one of the wings will contain a RIF installer.
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
There are several unique types of machines in Garrisons.
[[Heading:3]]Garrison Relay[[/Heading]]
Garrison Relays are machines located in each wing of the Garrison and contain 3-5 [[Relay Couplers]] that will be released if the machine is destroyed. If Cogmind is not RIF-aligned, destroying Garrison Relays will decrease the chance of exits being locked.
[[Heading:3]]Phase Generator[[/Heading]]
Phase Generators are explosive machines that are responsible for maintaining phase walls and stopping normal [[Sensor Arrays]], [[Terrain Scanners]], and the [[Structural Scanner]] from working. [[Active Sensor Suite]], the [[Seismic Detector]], and the [[Triangulator]] do work, however. If destroyed, all phase walls will be removed and sensor and terrain scanning functionality will be restored. This behavior does not change even if there are multiple Phase Generators in the same Garrison. Destroying a second does not have any additional effect, other than cause a large explosion. Phase Generators are not guaranteed to appear on any Garrison. When they do show up, they are often hidden behind phase walls or emergency access doors, although they may be located via audio cues as the loud machine can be heard through walls.
[[Heading:3]]Phase Wall[[/Heading]]
While not a machine, Phase Walls are special tiles that are powered by Phase Generators. They are not normally visible unless Cogmind has the Structural Interface RIF ability. They have less armor than standard Garrison walls, although this is not revealed unless Cogmind becomes aware of them by some means. Any bot standing in a phase wall will get a free 50% force field-like damage reduction. Cogmind cannot walk in one normally without Structural Interface. However, it is possible to ram a bot out of a phase wall to gain the shielding.
[[Heading:3]]RIF installer[[/Heading]]
There is always at least one RIF installer per Garrison, with a chance of a second. They may be hidden behind phase walls and emergency accesses and not easily visible. Stepping into the middle of one will first cause Cogmind to become RIF-aligned if there are no other conflicting alignments. [[Imprint|Imprinting]] and using a [[Core Reset Matrix]] will cause Cogmind to be unable to use a RIF installer. If Cogmind is already RIF-aligned, Cogmind will either gain a new [[~/rif.html|RIF ability]] or increase the level in an existing one. The machine itself is quite fragile, so be careful for [[Corruption]]-induced misfires or explosive traps destroying the machine before use.
[[Heading:2]]Patrols/Guards[[/Heading]]
The following bot types can appear as patrols in Garrisons:
[[List]][[C-30 ARC|ARCs]]|[[Brawler|Brawlers]]|[[Cutter|Cutters]]|[[Duelist|Duelists]]|[[Hunter|Hunters]]|[[Grunt|Grunts]]|[[Swarmer|Swarmers]]|[[Programmer|Programmers]][[/List]]
The following bot types can appear as guards inside checkpoints:
[[List]]ARCs (up to 4 can appear, although all but one will be unpowered|Brawlers|[[Demolisher]] + [[Protector]] combo|Duelists|Hunters|Grunts|Swarmers|[[Sentry|Sentries]]|[[Specialist|Specialists]][[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]Active scanning[[/Heading]]
Active Sensor Suites may bypass the Phase Generator to allow seeing all bots inside the Garrison. However, there is a downside to this. After scanning a few bots, a log message [[GameText]]ALERT: Active scanning activity detected within garrison interior, activating patrols.[[/GameText]] will appear. After this, all dormant bots will be activated, every checkpoint will be raised, and all guard bots will be sent to roam around the map randomly to search for hostiles. While the sensor effect is quite strong, the downsides are quite large and may not be worth the hassle of all the bots being released at the same time.
[[Heading:2]]Interior Compromised[[/Heading]]
After 1200 turns in a Garrison, if not triggered by another special event, the following message will be logged [[GameText]]ALERT: Garrison interior compromised[[/GameText]]. This also comes with a 100 [[Alert]] increase. After that initial 1200 turns, this message and Alert gain will repeat after 600, 300, and finally every further 150 turns. The first Garrison compromised message will trigger the [[Encrypted Comm Array]] to spawn in the next [[Caves]] map if Cogmind does not have an incompatible faction. Destroying various Garrison-specific machines will contribute to the multiplier.

[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There are always at least 3 exits per Garrison, the main 3 of which all lead to the same map. If RIF-aligned, all of the exits will always be available. Otherwise, exits may lock when trying to use them. Destroying Garrison Relays will lower the chance that the exits will lock on use. Only 2/3 of the main exits may lock, so it is not possible to get stuck on the map. There are 3 possibilities for Garrison exits:
[[List]]""Looping"": A Garrison may exit back to a new map at the original depth. This can happen as long as the Garrison wasn't entered from a DSF and a RIF installer wasn't used on a previous Garrison.|0b10-controlled branch: The following 0b10 branches are possible Garrison exit targets: [[Testing]], [[Quarantine]], and [[Redacted]][[Section 7]] only when entering a Garrison from Testing or Quarantine when Section 7 is on the same depth.[[/Redacted]]|0b10-controlled main floor: The exit continues onto the next main 0b10 depth.[[/List]]
There is also a special ""looping"" exit that will always loop or lead to a 0b10-controlled branch exit if available. This exit only rarely appears. It allows looping more than one time per depth even if a RIF installer has been used in a previous Garrison.

"Hub_04(d)","Location","Hub is a [[0b10]]-controlled [[Factory]] [[Branch]] that appears between -6 and -4. It is part of the [[Extension]] branch line and can only be entered through [[Archives]]. It is much more similar to normal floors than the rest of the Extension branch maps where all of the normal squad types can spawn regularly.
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
There are two types of special machines in Hub. The first, the [[Transfer Station]], is also common to Extension. When destroyed, it will reduce the number of non-combat robots on all 0b10-controlled maps by a stacking 50%. Note that this does not include [[Researcher|Researchers]].
[[Image]]Hub Explosion.gif|A Network Hub explosion[[/Image]]The other, the Network Hub, is a large EM explosive machine. When destroyed, it will reduce all machine hacking trace capabilities by 20%. Every further hub destroyed reduces by half that amount rounded down. In total, defenses are decreased by 20%, 30%, 35%, and 37%. This is equivalent to the first effect of defensive [[Hackware]]. A 20% tracing decrease is equivalent to wearing 2 base-tier [[System Shield|System Shields]]. Another effect of destroying a Network Hub is that 3 squads of 3 [[Lightning]] + 1 [[I-47 Archangel|Archangel]] will spawn from different exits and Garrisons. They will patrol around the remaining 3 Network Hubs are located. All non-combat hostiles will also be called to evacuate the map.
[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]
[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Hub_04(d)[[/Lore]]
[[Heading]]Variations[[/Heading]]There are 3 variations of the Hub map:
[[List]]Network Hubs in corners: All 4 Network Hub machines will be in their own corners of the map. They are not likely to overlap in explosion radius and cause chain reactions.|Network Hubs on left side: All 4 Network Hub machines will be on the left side of the map. It is likely that either the top 2 or bottom 2 Hub machines will overlap in explosion radius and guarantee a chain reaction. It is very rarely possible for all 4 Hubs to chain together.|Network hubs on right side: Same as above but on the right side of the map.[[/List]]
[[Heading]]Strategy[[/Heading]]
Blowing up Network Hubs as soon as you see them is usually a bad idea. Shooting them directly causes a ton of [[Alert]] gain due to their large destructive radius. The Lightning squads that follow can also be very scary for an unprepared Cogmind. If unprepared to fight off the Lightning, it is a good idea to blow up the Hubs from a distance or right next an exit.
There are a lot of methods to blow up Network Hubs that do not trigger the alert gain:
[[Heading:2]]Hostile attack[[/Heading]]
If Cogmind or an ally stands in front of a Network Hub and a 0b10 bot misses into it, the destruction will be associated with that bot and not Cogmind. This also works well with allies and drones. Just position the ally in front of a Hub and attacking enemies can shoot around or through them to trigger the explosion.
[[Heading:2]][[Traps|Trap]] explosion[[/Heading]]
Traps never assign Alert to Cogmind unless they manually trigger the trap. Any explosive or area EM traps will work, [[I]]but[[/I]] if the trap triggers due to Cogmind's corruption then the alert isn't assigned, which can be used to avoid the alert.
[[Heading:2]][[Plasma Cutter|Regular]] or [[Imp. Plasma Cutter]][[/Heading]]
Plasma Cutters can destroy any machine with minimal Alert gain. As a bonus, Plasma Cutters also do not trigger the explosion at all which can otherwise place Cogmind in a bad defensive position.
[[Heading:2]]Force(Sabotage)[[/Heading]]
If successful, this hack will blow up a random explosive machine on the map. Network Hubs are the only available targets so this will always work on this map. This hack is inconsistent and may fail multiple times in a row. This hack will cause an Alert gain of 50 if successful, but it is substantially less than the several hundred of a manually-blown Network Hub. Note: unlike this hack, Trojan(Detonate) does cause Alert to go up from the Explosion and is not a great hack to use.
[[Heading:2]]Lightning[[/Heading]]
The best way to deal with the Lightning squads is to use critical destroy weapons as they lack any critical immunity. [[8R-AWN's Boregun]], [[Adv. KE Penetrator]], and any Hyp. guns or cannons will work well. [[Damper Plating]] works great at reducing damage taken by Lightnings to negligible amounts. The [[Exp. EM Disruption Field]] that they carry can also do fine after being looted.

[[Heading:2]]Getting Scanned[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Lab Visible Lasers.png|Visible Lab intruder detecting lasers[[/Image]]
The lasers are invisible by default, although the A7 core and using the Data Conduit will reveal them. They are 3x3 squares of yellow tiles that move randomly. Every turn there is a chance that they will move in one of the cardinal directions. The center tiles cannot overlap with other lasers and they cannot move through walls, machines, or past the entrance of the Lab. Being within the 3x3 area will result in being scanned immediately. This will cause an announcement [[GameText]]A0_COM: INTRUDER ALERT[[/GameText]] and [[A5]] will show up and fight. This scan will also cause [[Intercept Squad|Intercepts]] to appear on most [[0b10]]-controlled floors. The other way to get scanned is to break either the outer wall of Reinforced Barriers or to destroy the Active System Cloaker machine on the right side of the map. Other machines are safe to break.
The inside of the Lab contains many unique item spawns. In counter-clockwise order starting from the entrance:
[[List]]Big machine on top right: [[Core Reset Matrix]]|[[Alien Artifacts|Alien Artifact]] shell on top right of map #1: [[Transdimensional Reconstructor]]|Shell #2 (middle): [[Integrated Dissipator]], [[Integrated Mediator]], or [[Integrated Reactor]]|Shell #3 (left): [[Core Expander]] or [[Core Regenerator]]|Top left item spot #1: [[Deep Network Scanner]] or [[Quantum Router]]|Item spot #2: [[AEGIS Remote Shield]], [[Exp.

EM Gauss Rifle]], [[Potential Cannon]], [[Tachyon Dispersion Ray]], or [[Warp Cannon]]|Item tucked into bottom right wall: [[Gui. Remote Datajack]][[/List]]
There is also a locked chamber at the bottom of the map. Accessing it requires walking through a scan laser positioned in the bottom left corner of the lab. The Blast Barrier that locks the door has 45 armor and no Thermal resistance, but 50% resistance for most other major damage types. Inside is a machine that contains the [[LC Capacitor]].
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
Not counting the entrance Terminal, there are 3 unique interactive Terminals on this map. They will only be understandable if the Data Conduit has been used this run, otherwise they will just be garbled text. The Active System Cloaker machine on the right has some lore records and will summon a squad of [[Grunt|Grunts]] when destroyed. The A0 Command machine on the left only has lore records. Some of these records can only be unlocked if certain gameplay actions were performed this game. The hidden Storage 04-B machine has some lore records explaining the LC Capacitor and has a hack that will drop the Capacitor on the ground where it can be used.
[[Heading]]Unlockable Lab Orders[[/Heading]]
While most of the Lab Orders in the A0 Command machine are available all of the time, there are a few that have special conditions to achieve:
[[List]]Order 6-0321: Destroy the [[Cetus]] Manufacturing Module machine|Order 6-0323: [[Warlord]] must be destroyed in his [[Warlord (Location)|base]]. Cogmind does not need to be the one to destroy Warlord or attack him at all.|Order 6-0324: Warlord must be met in his base, survive, and plan to attack -2 [[Research]][[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]L2 Power Cell code[[/Heading]]
Order 6-0319 will provide a manual Terminal hack that can be used in [[Section 7]] on the Power Cell Monitoring machine. Using it will create a powerful explosion that will destroy any combat bots in its 20 tile range.","Redacted","","","","",""
"Materials","Location","Materials is the first real level of the game. These maps are small, cramped and have few paths forward. This is the first map with hostile [[0b10]] patrols hanging around, comprised mainly of low level [[G-34 Mercenary]] and [[G-47 Trooper]] grunts and [[S-10 Pest]] swarmers. There are also a few special special mechanics such as [[U-05 Engineer|Engineers]] not calling for reinforcements when attacked while trying to build structures in -10 and -9 and [[A-02 Transporter|Haulers]] not calling for reinforcements at all.
Trying to play flight or hover is not easy in Materials due to many forced encounters with combat robots, little room for maneuvering and few slots yet available for good utilities. The usual recommended way to play these maps is to grab some legs or treads and start blasting. Most players prefer not to transfer to airborne propulsion until [[Factory]] where it is much easier to stealth around and avoid combat. In Materials, it's good to fight enemies one at a time by leading them to one of the many doorways around the map. Use of launchers is very effective whenever there is more than a single bot grouped up close.
[[Alert]] is not a big issue in these maps because of the relatively small map size and number of total patrols. If making a mess of the floors on -10 and -9, entering the [[Mines]] is a good way to lose all of the alert gained from the early Materials maps.

Cogmind only starts with a [[Sml. Storage Unit]] with very little room for important backup parts and should upgrade ASAP. While not guaranteed, these storage caches will appear on almost every Materials map. [[Hcp. Storage Unit]] and [[Huge Storage Unit]] can both be commonly found on the floor in these maps, but they are not included in the standard storage cache prefab.
The other important cache is the out-of-depth parts cache. These caches contain 3 groups of 4 parts that will be one rating out of depth and can include prototypes. For example, on -9 Materials the standard highest rating part is a 2, while the cache will contain rating 3 or 3* [[Prototype Part|Prototype Parts]]. This is one of the best ways to become very strong in Materials. For example, getting a stockpile of [[Enh. Autogun|Enh.

"Mines","Location","Mines is one of the first [[Branch|Branches]] of the game and is guaranteed to appear on -10 and -9 of [[Materials]] in every game. These maps have several unique early-game rewards that can pay off throughout the whole run, but also has some very dangerous events. The assembled infestation event is a common cause of early death in runs. Aside from the events, the map is sparsely populated with early game patrols of [[G-34 Mercenary]] and [[G-47 Trooper]] grunts and [[S-10 Pest]] swarmers. Several types of friendly and occasionally hostile Derelicts can also be found here. [[Derelict Log|Derelict Logs]] and [[Scrap]] can be found randomly on the ground.

A few Assembled will also show up buried in the walls. Squads of [[T-07 Excavator|Tunnelers]] guarded by [[G-34 Mercenary|Grunts]] will be dispatched continuously every several hundred turns to dig out the collapsed tiles. Using a digging tool like a [[Mining Laser]] or [[Mining Claw]] is recommended to escape quicker.|(--) Assembled invasion: A large number of Assembled will appear and start attacking everything nearby. An [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] containing 2 [[D-53 Grenadier|Demolishers]] will be dispatched from the closest Materials exit and sent to the initial spawn location. A [[Guerrilla (5)|Derelict]] will appear next to you and tell you to run away as they provide a distraction. This event is extremely dangerous so early in the game as both the Assembled and Demolishers can deal a lot of damage very quickly. A launcher is highly recommended for dealing with the Assembled, while strong single-target weapons like kinetic cannons are ideal for dealing with the Demolishers. Getting stuck between them both is the worst case scenario and stripping to core and running is sometimes the only option to survive. A good tactic to avoid combat is to try to dig into the walls using a digging tool like a [[Mining Laser]] or [[Mining Claw]] and hide out of sight for a few hundred turns. Usually, most of the Assembled and Demolishers end up destroying each other.[[/List]]","","","","","",""
"Quarantine","Location","Quarantine is a [[0b10]]-controlled [[Branch]] off of [[Research]] that appears on either -3 or -2. It is always on the floor that [[Testing]] is not on. Quarantine is a much smaller and generally more manageable map compared to normal Research floors. There are few patrols, no [[Sentry]] or [[Heavy]] guards, and only a few special mini guard areas that can usually be easily avoided. There are unique [[Researcher]] bots that show up on this map that have dangerous effects when getting scanned. Quarantine is home to a large number of unique [[Alien Artifacts]] that can be strong equippable parts or consumable effects not found elsewhere. Unlike most maps, the ambient temperature in Quarantine is -20 rather than 0. This has the effect of giving an additional 20 heat dissipation per turn to all bots on the map. Like all Research branches, [[Farcom]] will trigger [[Maximum Security]] upon entry.
Testing is home to the [[Sigix Containment Pod]], a captured [[Sigix]] warrior being trapped in a cage. Carrying the Sigix to the [[Surface]] is required to achieve a W3 [[Wintypes]]. The Sigix always spawns in the vertically opposite corner of the map that Cogmind first spawns on. For example, if Cogmind would spawn in the top-left section of the map, the Sigix would be in the bottom left. The Sigix is locked behind a [[Terminal]] and some Sealed Heavy Doors with 40 armor. After opening or digging past the doors, the Sigix will have some garbled dialogue unless Cogmind has used a [[Core Reset Matrix]] first. There will be a lockdown [[Patrol Squad|patrol squad]] dispatched consisting of an [[I-47 Archangel]] and 3 [[Lightning|Lightnings]] at this point. They do not have active tracking on Cogmind but simply patrol around the area. Behind the doors, one Terminal contains the access code needed to be used on the other Terminal to open the 80 armor Sigix Quarantine Chamber.
[[Heading:2]]Getting Scanned[[/Heading]]
Attacking when in visual range of a Researcher or attacking a Researcher will result in them turning yellow and attempting to stasis and scan any hostiles. Whenever any bot is caught in stasis, the Researcher will summon a [[Reinforcement Squad]] to its current position. If Cogmind is scanned, it will also result in [[Q-Series]] being summoned instead of [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]]. These Q-Series have custom loadout that depends on Cogmind's current build.
Typically getting scanned is seen as a negative due to the high power level of Q-Series. Some builds might intentionally want to get scanned in order to get the Q-Series loot. To avoid unintentionally scanning, detach any ranged weapons whenever a Researcher is in line of sight of Cogmind. Melee weapons, special weapons like [[Datajacks]], and any type of guided weapon are safe to keep equipped to avoid misfires due to [[Corruption]].
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
There is one special type of machine in Quarantine called the Cryocooling Duct. There is usually at least one of these on every Quarantine floor. The map is affected by how many ducts are destroyed:
[[List]]0: The ambient temperature of the map is -20|1: The ambient temperature of the map rises to 0. All noncombat (green) bots are called to evacuate map and will head toward the nearest exit. This does [[Researcher|Researchers]] and green [[Operator|Operators]] that have already spotted Cogmind, but yellow Operators and [[Watcher|Watchers]] will not exit the map.|2: The ambient temperature becomes +20 which will apply 20 heat to all bots on the map every turn. All combat hostiles will be called to evacuate the map and most forms of squad dispatches will stop happening, including [[Assault Squad|Assaults]] and [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]]. After about 100 turns, 12 [[Quarantine Guard|Quarantine Guards]] will be dispatched to the map. Some will patrol around the map looking for hostiles, while others will guard key spots like exits and the [[Garrison (Machine)|Garrison]] (if any are present).|3+: Ambient heat continues to rise +20 per destroyed machine, but no other special effects occur.[[/List]]

"Recycling","Location","Recycling is an early game [[0b10]]-controlled [[Branch]] with few active combat hostiles. The 3 ways to enter this branch are by using the [[GameText]]\\IAMDERELICT[[/GameText]] code at the Recycling exit in [[Storage]], by entering a Storage [[Garrison (Machine)|Garrisons]] and looping back into this floor instead of proceeding to the next depth, or by taking the guarded exit in [[Subcaves]]. There are a few dormant [[Sentry|Sentries]] guarding hallways and several more in rooms with large amounts of rewirable bots. Unlike most 0b10 maps, more combat bots will not be summoned in any scenario. Recycling is unique in that it forces a skipped depth. For example, entering a Storage map on -8 leads to a Recycling map on -8 that leads to a [[Factory]] map on -6 rather than -7 like most branches.
The main benefits to going to Recycling are for [[Scraptown]] or obtaining the unique [[Scrap Engine]] from the scraplab. Because there are no combat reinforcements of any kind, there are few downsides to getting traced at all of the [[Terminal|Terminals]] and [[Recycling Machine|Recycling Machines]] aside from minor [[Alert]] gain. There are a large number of Recycling Machines on this map and using [[GameText]]Force(Tunnel)[[/GameText]] on all of them can be very helpful in uncovering the depths of many maps in the floors above. There are commonly a large number of [[Corrupted Parts|corrupted]] [[Authchips]] available for players who want to do a lot of [[Fabricator|Fabrication]]. A small army can be raised off of the rewirable bots in some of the rooms, though tend to be heavily damaged.

[[Heading:2]]Scraplab[[/Heading]]
Cogmind can gain access to the Scraplab by entering a particular dead end-seeming rectangular room. Inside are Terminals providing information on the [[Scrap Engine]] and a way to eject the Scrap Engine. Beware that releasing the Scrap Engine will count as a hostile action and cause the Scraptown exit to close and all inhabitants of the Scraplab to become hostile. One additional [[Scrapper]] will appear from the exit to attack Cogmind when this happens.
[[Heading:3]][[SUBCON Basin]] delivery[[/Heading]]
If the full SUBCON basin is delivered from Subcaves and dropped on the ground, one of the [[Scientist|Scientists]] will drop a [[Tech Extrapolator]] on the ground. This is the only way to obtain one without attacking Scraptown, as the Extrapolators attached to the scientists in the lab will explode after death.

If 01-MTF is brought from Storage to the Scraplab, a special event will occur. 01-MTF will try to explain something to [[KN-7UR]], but KN-7UR will say that his time is up, and they will begin to fight. Cogmind may choose to help out in the fight. If Cogmind attacks KN-7UR and 01-MTF wins the fight, 01-MTF will drop a 99 charge [[Relay Coupler [Proto]]].

"Research","Location","Research is a [[0b10]]-controlled main floor that appears on both -3 and -2. Research maps continue to amp up the difficulty in strength and number of general combat encounters, hacking difficulty, and difficulty in locating exits. Compared to the previous [[Factory]] floors, Research maps are just as big, but are much more maze-like with large numbers of smaller interconnected rooms and big sections of the level entirely disconnected by large chunks of earth. Exploring all of these different rooms is more difficult than before, and finding an exit can be a real challenge.
Unlike factory floors with [[Caves]] available, there are usually no easy exits to dissipate [[Alert]] in Research. The natural alert dissipation that occurs between levels continues to decrease. Purging alert or avoiding generating it in the first place can be a big deal if the player is not prepared to fight off [[High Security]]. [[Infowar]] continues to be important to avoid unnecessary encounters whenever possible, and [[Hackware]] should be used to purge alert and locate exits whenever possible.
As the difficulty increases, the rewards do to match. Many powerful unique parts can be found in Research specific branches [[Testing]] and [[Quarantine]]. There are also more [[Prototype Part|Prototypes]] lying around on the floor. Using a [[Component Analysis Suites|Component Analysis Suite]] can pay off to avoid attaching faulty prototypes.
A big change in Research is the final upgrade of Programmers. The 1-2 [[P-70 Sage|Sages]] per [[Extermination Squad|Extermination]] get upgraded to being 2-3 [[P-80 Master|Masters]]. The extra Programmer on average, higher core integrity, and higher damage output make them a serious threat to prepare for. Many builds will live or die based on how well they can handle Exterminations. Look for a way to kill in a single core shot, like using a [[Enh. Nova Cannon]]. Airborne builds can instead make use of recall hacks or get spotted and run away to avoid direct combat.
Other important Research level bot upgrades are [[Heavy|Heavies]] and [[Hunter|Hunters]] upgrading to their highest tier on -2. The [[H-81 Overseer]] deals a frightening 91 damage per volley, becomes even tougher to kill, and gains a visual upgrade to 22 tiles which is further than the telltale 20 tile range of the [[Active Sensor Suite]]. The [[H-88 Terminator]] is also a very formidable opponent. The scary changes here are the upgrade from an [[Imp. Phase Shifter]] to an [[Adv. Phase Shifter]] which makes them even more difficult to hit, and the Scan Cloak (4) trait which makes them invisible on [[Sensor Arrays]] unless using an [[Exp. Signal Interpreter]]. If fighting them head on, using [[Launchers]] to aim indirectly or Treads with [[Siege Mode]] can help a lot.

Eventually, the Terminal network will be shut down, and [[Prototype Robot|Prototype]] [[Executioner|Executioners]] and [[Striker|Strikers]] will be dispatched along with assault [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]].

[[Heading:2]]-2 [[Warlord (Alignment)|Warlord Invasion]][[/Heading]]
If Warlord is aligned with in his [[Warlord (Location)|base]], he will bring huge groups of [[Derelict]] forces to attack Research. All traps on the floor will be disabled after 50 turns, and after 110 that the entire machine network will be turned offline, except for [[Garrison (Machine)|Garrisons]]. Waves of Derelicts will spawn on the left side of the map, while Assaults, [[D-83 Annihilator|D-83 Annihilators]], Strikers, and Executioners spawn from Garrisons and exits.[[/Spoiler]]","","","","","",""
"Scraptown","Location","Scraptown is a [[Branch]] accessible through [[Recycling]], based in the Old 0b1 Recycling map, that is the home to a large amount of [[UFD|United Federation of Derelicts (UFD)]]-aligned [[Derelict|Derelicts]]. Scraptown contains many different groups of Derelicts and most have various rooms that can appear from run to run. The overall layout of Scraptown is the same each run, but the rooms will contain different combinations of groups each time. There are C-Scrubber machines at the entrance and all exits on this map that will cleanse corruption, and their use is recommended to avoid misfiring and causing accidental hostilities.
The map always consists of an open left area that all bots are free to explore. The map is divided by a giant UFD HQ Gate with [[Triborg]] guarding nearby. The gate has 60 armor and high resistances to all main damage types except for Thermal damage. Realistically, the only options to cut through are [[Plasma Cutters|Plasma Cutter]] or the [[Siege Cannon]]. However, the gate will open automatically if Cogmind becomes UFD aligned. The right side of the map contains many more unique rooms.
[[Heading]]Alignment - [[UFD]][[/Heading]]
Talking to the Scrapper standing next to the UFD registry near the HQ gate will allow Cogmind to become a UFD member and enter the right side of the map. This alignment is only possible if Cogmind is not [[RIF]]-aligned, has not taken [[Farcom]], and has not stolen or attacked the [[Exiles (Group)|Exiles]].
Aside from access to the right side of the map, Cogmind also gains access to 2 new [[Recycling Machine]] hacks [[GameText]]Force(Scrapoids)[[/GameText]] to summon [[Scrapoid|Scrapoids]] and [[GameText]]Force(Fedlink)[[/GameText]] to allocate more resources to the UFD recycling network.
[[Heading]]Hostilities[[/Heading]]
The UFD is typically friendly to Cogmind but will turn hostile if Cogmind attacks a bot or digs through any dirt or machine tiles. There are a large amount of bots that will turn hostile to Cogmind, so attacking should not be done lightly. If Cogmind is capable of taking down all of its inhabitants, there are a large number of unique items that are only available by attacking Scraptown.
[[Heading:2]]Attack Mechanics[[/Heading]]
After Cogmind either attacks a bot or destroys a wall or machine tile, every UFD bot will turn hostile to Cogmind with the message [[GameText]]Intruder alert! Defend Scraptown![[/GameText]]. After that, certain events will occur in a predictable fashion:
[[List]]~75 turns: 4 [[Scrapper|Scrappers]] will come from the left exit and guard it.|~100 turns: The message [[GameText]]Triborg tracking relay activated. Stay clear or you only have yourself to blame![[/GameText]] appears. Triborg will gain tracking on Cogmind and pursue throughout the map. Triborg will shoot through walls like a [[Behemoth]], so hiding is not particularly effective|~250 turns: The message [[GameText]]HQ reinforcements inbound. Hold Tight![[/GameText]] will appear.|~350 turns: Reinforcements will start to appear from exits on the left and right sides of the map. A large group of bots will appear instantly, and more will trickle onto the map over time.[[/List]]

The Cartography Club contains multiple rewards that are locked behind a maze. These items are a [[Mapping Drone Bay]] (not guaranteed), a [[Surveybot 17 Chip]] (not guaranteed), a Terminal filled with various forms of map intel (guaranteed), and a [[Deep Structural Scanner]] (guaranteed). In order to perform steps 4-6, Cogmind must be at least 50 speed. A grounded bot can temporarily purge items in order to complete the puzzle, as core hover is enough speed.
The maze may mirrored horizontally from the example image. The following steps will solve the maze:

[[Heading]]Fighting Scraptown[[/Heading]]
Scraptown is a challenging area to fight. The majority of the armed bots are individually weak, but in the dozens they can overwhelm Cogmind and wear down any defenses. Many unique items are only obtainable by destroying terrain or killing certain bots, which can make attacking Scraptown a promising endeavor. However, there is a serious drawback of going for a full clear or even smashing a container for one item and running: The [[Zion]] and [[Warlord (Location)]] maps will become hostile when Cogmind tries to enter them.
[[Heading:2]]Items obtainable by murder[[/Heading]]

Humpback - Curator's Association Exhibit[[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]Requirements[[/Heading]]
In order to effectively full clear Scraptown, there are a few general requirements:
[[Heading:3]]Triborg Solve[[/Heading]]
Triborg is by far the scariest individual bot on the map with an incredibly powerful [[Siege Cannon]] that can quickly kill an unprepared Cogmind. Siege mode brings Triborg's initially high 40% core exposure down to a significantly reduced 28% which makes direct damage dealing a rather inefficient method. An EM resistance of 65% doesn't help an EM approach much either, with an average requirement of 285 EM damage to be dealt before corruption death. Very little conventional weaponry can deal enough damage to eliminate Triborg in a reasonable amount of time.
The most reliable way to beat Triborg is with meltdown. Large groups of allies with heat transfer can easily overheat Triborg before it gets much chance to deal damage. [[Storage]] frequently has a vault of 10 [[Grunt|Grunts]] that will become friendly to Cogmind upon entry. These 10 Grunts are sufficient to melt Triborg within a few volleys, if not instantly. [[Army Drone|Army Drones]] from [[Army-in-a-Box]] can also produce sufficient heat transfer for an easy kill. [[DAS Turret|DAS Turrets]] from Deploy-a-Sentry do not have heat transfer but have extremely high damage output, so if Cogmind can hold Triborg's fire, 3 or 4 turrets taken from the Exiles can deal enough conventional damage for core destruction.
Aside from allies, there are few other Exiles Prototypes that can handle the Triborg fight reasonably well:
[[List]][[AWS/Autocannon]]: The Autocannon has an incredibly high damage output that can take Triborg out within 4 core hits.|[[Field Lobotomy Kit]]: Triborg is not Disruption immune so the FLK will instantly turn a threat into a useful ally|[[Firepult]]: Firepult has sufficient heat transfer to melt Triborg with ease. Make sure to pack plenty of cooling to use this early.|[[YOLO Cannon]]: YOLO Cannon's high 50% meltdown critical easily kills Triborg. Note: the AOE effect of YOLO cannon may damage the loot on the ground.[[/List]]
[[Heading:3]]Trash Killer[[/Heading]]
Cogmind should have an efficient way of dealing with the dozens of average to weak strength bots that will swarm Scraptown after hostilities begin. Any decent rating parts can solve this, although some parts are particularly good at this role. This is an essential role as merely passable weapons will result in Cogmind taking a lot of damage in the long run as each bot gets a few shots off before being destroyed. Here are some above average parts for the job:
[[List]]AWS/Autocannon: Autocannon has enough damage to core any bot on this level, builtin targeting, fires beyond Cogmind's vision, and even has no upkeep cost.|[[AWS/Gauss]]: Notably worse than the Autocannon with significantly lower damage, but still good for similar traits. With 3 weapon slots, can be combined with another non-AWS weapon for additional damage.|[[AWS/Thermal]]: As powerful as the AWS/Gauss but suffers from a significant range decrease to 14. Should be used in close quarters as kinetic bots can outrange this part.|Siege Cannon: Easily lootable off of Triborg with a CPS Tube. This requires the use of [[Tri-treads]] also dropped from Triborg to enter siege mode and avoid the recoil chance.|[[Hvy. Assault Cannon]]: High range and sufficient damage to one shot any bot on core.|DAS Turrets have high visual range (22) and will kill every bot in one core hit. Keep in mind that eventually they will run low on matter and take longer to fire.|Storage Grunt Army: While they don't last forever, a well positioned Grunt army can act as a firing squad for bots that wander into their line of sight.|Army-in-a-Box: Similar to a Grunt army, only there's a lot more Army Drones available. Don't use too many at once or else they will get in each others' way.[[/List]]
[[Heading:3]]Way to cut through to right side[[/Heading]]
It is a much easier task to avoid becoming a UFD member and opening the gate before hostilities. In order to do this and still perform a full clear, Cogmind must have a way to dig through the HQ gate. The only options are a Siege Cannon from Triborg, a [[Plasma Cutter]], a YOLO Cannon, or an EM [[Launchers]] like an [[EMP Blaster]] with rating 3 or higher engines. The [[Imp. Deuterium Engine|Imp. Deuterium Engines]] dropped by Elites are a good choice for EM Launchers.
[[Heading:3]]Essential Parts[[/Heading]]
No NPC murder setup is complete without a few highly essential build components:
[[List]]Backup Treads: Cogmind can easily salvage Triborg for Tri-treads and those should be used if possible. However, depending on Cogmind's starting position, it may be possible to be stuck fighting without having time to move over to the Triborg loot and swapping to the treads. Additionally, if Cogmind happens to miss a CPS tube, a lot of essential loot may not drop.|Backup Wheels (Optional): [[Wheels]] are useful to temporarily swap on to move quickly. Useful for picking up matter out of Tractor Beam range.|Backup Armor: Self-explanatory. Triborg drops [[Mak. Medium Armor Plating]] and [[Elite|Elites]] drop [[Mak. Light Armor Plating]] to use in a pinch.|Backup Weapons: Aside from Siege Cannon, most of the weapons dropped by NPCs on this map are not ideal for Cogmind to use in Scraptown.|Backup Power: Self-explanatory.|[[Cooling Devices]] (optional): Siege Cannon in particular is hot to use in prolonged combat.|[[Targeting Computers]]/[[Weapon Cyclers]]/[[Core Analyzers]] (optional): Useful offensive utilities|[[Hardlight Generators]]/[[Shield Generators]]/[[Force Fields]] (optional): Useful defensive utilities|[[Tractor Beam|Normal]] or [[Hpw. Tractor Beam]] and [[Matter Compressors]] (optional): Siege cannon requires a lot of matter to use. Matter storage and Tractor Beams allow Cogmind to continue to fight in extended encounters without having to reposition to collect more matter.|[[Adv. Visual Processing Unit]]/[[Seismic Detector]] (optional): With long ranged weapons like Siege Cannon, it is best to hit enemies before they can see you and outside of their visual range.[[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]When to Kill[[/Heading]]
Generally, a build should be designed for killing Scraptown several maps ahead of time. This will typically involve going to [[Exiles (Location)]] and either taking [[Farcom]] or killing/stealing for powerful Exiles prototypes that can handle Scraptown kills. Scraptown kills are best done on -8 or -7 for this reason. While it is still possible to kill on -9, it will be much more difficult with the small number of slots and no potential for Exiles prototypes. Cogmind should have at least 3 propulsion slots and 3 weapon slots to use Tri-treads and Siege Cannon from Triborg.
[[Heading:2]]Location to Fight[[/Heading]]
When engaging hostilities, there are 2 best points where Cogmind can choose to start the fight:
[[Heading:3]]Next to the UFD Gate[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Scraptown Triborg Surrounded.png|Grunts surrounding Triborg prepared to melt it down, with nearby Protector[[/Image]]
The gate is the best place to begin if Cogmind has allies or a quick way to neutralize Triborg. There is lots of room so allies won't have to run past each other or try to shoot through each other like they would in hallways. This area also has favorable sightlines if Cogmind has vision utilities or a DAS Turret to work with Siege Cannon. Allies should be positioned around Triborg in a box as shown to the right. If a [[Protector]] is available, place it close to the Gate so it is more out of harms way.
[[Heading:3]]Bottom Left Corner[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Scraptown Bottom Left Triborg Path.png|Path Triborg should take if in the bottom left corner[[/Image]]
If Cogmind the only solution for Triborg is brute force like with an AWS/Autocannon, it may be better to hide in the corner of the map so that bots do not swarm the center more quickly than Cogmind can kill them. Stay in the position shown in the image to the right to begin hostilities. When Triborg peeks around the corner, move up a few tiles so Triborg is forced to move closer to Cogmind to shoot. The right side path to this location is a little short, but the top path can take good advantage of the large sightlines.
[[Heading:2]]Beginning Hostilities[[/Heading]]
If Cogmind starts the Scraptown assault near Triborg, the #1 priority is to use a CPS tube on Triborg to ensure full salvage drops. Take out Triborg with whatever means are available, then grab and equip the Tri-treads and Siege Cannon (if slots available). If fighting in the corner, start by either shooting a wall out or killing any nearby bot. Lure Triborg close and use the CPS Tube, then go for the kill. After Triborg is dead, stay put and slowly clear out the UFD reinforcements. This process can take a large amount of time as the bots wander the map slowly instead of making a targeted assault on Cogmind.
At this point, patience is key. Leaving too soon can cause a lot of extra shots up on Cogmind. Generally, only moving around to collect more matter when needed is the best strategy here. Otherwise, stay put until close to 60 bots or so have been killed. After bots stops showing up, it is fairly safe to explore the rest of the left side and clear out the few remaining stragglers. Take this chance to evaluate the essentials and backups situation and pick up parts from the ground as needed.
[[Heading:2]]Opening the gate[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Scraptown Wall Dig.png|Digging past the gate[[/Image]]
Once the left side is fully cleared out, the right side must be opened with a Siege Cannon, Plasma Cutter, or YOLO Cannon. Siege cannon is preferred because it can penetrate a single tile-wide line through the gate. This kind of layout works best so that bots don't swarm out. It works well with the high penetration capabilities of the Siege Cannon too. A diagonal dig as shown to the right is preferred; even if a few missed shots destroy parts of the wall, it is more difficult for multiple bots to get an angle on Cogmind to shoot past each other.
The right side is mostly more of the same. Wait for bots to come to you from your safe position. There are another roughly 60 bots to kill on this side of the map. Otherwise, there is nothing too special about this portion as long as Cogmind has enough spare parts to last without the build falling apart. After the bots stop wandering by, walk into the right side of the wall. There will be 4 Elites patrolling in the center-most HQ area. Take them out and the loot should be yours for the taking. The only other hostiles that can appear after clearing out all of the roamers are an [[Autobeam Turret]] in the Curator's Exhibit, which shouldn't be much of an issue at this point, and an Explorer or two behind the walls in the Cartography Club.
[[Heading:2]]Loot Time[[/Heading]]
Most of the loot should be fairly self explanatory to grab. A few less obvious ones:
[[List]]Smash open the wall hiding a Schematic in IN-MT5's Study|Dig out the corners in the Curator's Association because one will have an extra item|Dig through the back of the Scrapoid Pod storage to get many more pods|Dig out the center earth tile in LU-1G1's Boring Crew room|Check rooms closed for remodeling for the rare Exp.

Waiting around for this event can be fairly risky since there is no way to prepare for the fight and it is very easy to get destroyed by either the demolishers or the assembled.","","","","","",""
"Section 7","Location","Section 7 is a [[0b10]]-controlled [[Research]] [[Branch]] off of either [[Testing]] or [[Quarantine]] that always appears on -3 or -2. Quarantine must come before Section 7, so a -3 Testing followed by Section 7 is not possible. Compared to the previous branches, Section 7 is a lot tougher and more like a regular Research floor. Patrols are denser, [[Sentry|Sentries]] and [[Heavy|Heavies]] are present on the map, and [[Researcher|Researchers]] are present in higher numbers and have a worse scan effects. However, the [[Alien Artifacts|Alien Artifact]] unique parts can be quite gamechanging and can include effects like strong weaponry, part integrity regeneration effects, and permanent buffs to Cogmind for the remainder of the game. This map is also home to powerful [[S7 Guard|S7 Guards]] that guard some of the more powerful and unique Artifacts. Like all Research branches, [[Farcom]] will trigger [[Maximum Security]] upon entry.
The left side of the map is different each run, but the right half, the ""hangar"", is always static. The hangar primarily contains large pieces of machinery used for the construction of a ship based after the Leopard, the [[Sigix]] ship that attacked 0b10. It also contains various Alien Artifacts, an LRC cache containing related Artifacts and is where LRC versions are tested, and several dormant prototype bot guards. The top section of this area is locked by Sealed Heavy Doors with 50 armor and strong resistances to all major damage types except for thermal damage.
[[Heading:2]]Getting Scanned[[/Heading]]
Attacking when in visual range of a Researcher or attacking a Researcher will result in them turning yellow and attempting to stasis and scan any hostiles. Whenever any bot is caught in stasis, the Researcher will summon a [[Reinforcement Squad]] to its current position. Unlike the Q-Series spawns of Testing/Quarantine, if Cogmind is scanned in Section 7, it will also result in [[Intercept Squad|Intercepts]] being summoned. These Intercepts are extremely dangerous to unprepared builds, combat and stealth alike. To avoid unintentionally scanning, detach any ranged weapons whenever a Researcher is in line of sight of Cogmind. Melee weapons, special weapons like [[Datajacks]], and any type of guided weapon are safe to keep equipped to avoid misfires due to [[Corruption]].

[[Heading:2]]Alien Artifacts[[/Heading]]
Some Section 7 hangar artifacts have fixed possibilities, but there are many prefabs that have a random selection of parts available.[[Heading:3]]Unguarded Alien Artifacts[[/Heading]]These Artifacts can be present in Suspension Chambers on the left side of the map with no S7 Guards. Duplicates are permitted on the same map.

[[Heading:3]]Fixed Hangar Artifacts[[/Heading]]
There are 3 sections on the top of the map with fixed spawns. The top left chamber can contain 1-3 Terrabombs. The chamber just to the right of that contains 1-4 [[Transdimensional Reconstructor|Normal]] or [[Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor|Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructors]]. Next on the right is a chamber with a guaranteed [[Drained L-Cannon]] and 0-2 [[Matter Drive|Matter Drives]]. On the far right, hidden behind a large mass of machinery, is a room with 1-3 [[Sigix Sheargun|Sigix Shearguns]] and rarely a [[Sigix Shearcannon]] in the chamber below guarded by a [[Watcher]] and two dormant [[Striker|Strikers]] on the inside, and a further two on the outside. All will be awoken by the Watcher.
[[Heading:3]]LRC Lab[[/Heading]]There are 2 different groups of Alien Artifact spawns in the LRC lab. The Suspension Chambers on the top-right side and the top-left side of the map share a single pool of items. The left side can have anywhere from 1-3 copies of the same Artifact. Neither are guaranteed, but choose from the following pool of items:
[[List]][[Core Expander]]|[[Core Reset Matrix]]|[[Integrated Dissipator]]|[[Integrated Reactor]]|[[Integrity Redistributor]][[/List]]
The LRC cache at the bottom of this area can contain the following items (duplicates allowed):
[[List]][[LRC Armor]]|[[LRC Inertial Stabilizer]]|[[LRC Energy Well]]|[[LRC Insulator]]|[[LRC Matter Compressor]]|[[LRC Storage]][[/List]]
[[Heading:3]][[Sigix Exoskeleton]][[/Heading]]The room at the bottom right of the map is the Exoskeleton. There is a Terminal on the right and the unpowered Exoskeleton at the bottom behind a Suspension Chamber. The Exoskeleton can become the [[Sigix Warrior]] when the [[Sigix Containment Pod]] is carried from Quarantine into this chamber and the Activate Exoskeleton hack is performed. The Warrior will follow Cogmind as a normal ally and can be used for the W3 [[Wintypes|Wintype]]. When fighting, the Sigix Warrior will sometimes log the message [[GameText]]Synergy achieved. Target locked: {target}[[/GameText]]. When this occurs, both the Warrior and Cogmind will gain a 15% targeting bonus against the target.
If a [[Core Reset Matrix]] is used, the log message [[GameText]]Sigix Exoskeleton lights up in response to your presence[[/GameText]], and attempting to walk into it will add [[GameText]]Exoskeleton opens, ready for integration override sequence[[/GameText]]. Repeating the movement will force Cogmind into the Exoskeleton and strip all parts. Cogmind will receive innate buffs to energy storage, energy generation, and heat dissipation depending on how many slots were ""consumed"" as a part of this process. The final slot distribution is 1 power slot, 3 propulsion slots (with an nondetachable Sigix Exoskeleton part), 3 utility slots, and 2 weapon slots that are filled with (detachable) Sigix Shearguns. Evolution can occur as normal from this point on. Most parts will be well protected with the extremely high coverage of the Exoskeleton, but as a tradeoff Cogmind takes 25% of all damage dealt to the Exoskeleton additionally as core damage. Some additional benefits are an 18-radius perfect robot, terrain, and item detection info, a distance from exit indicator, and spawns of [[Assembled (7)|Assembled]] from the ground in main 0b10 floors and [[Command]].
If either Cogmind wearing the Exoskeleton or the Sigix Warrior are spotted by a hostile, [[Maximum Security]] will immediately be engaged.
[[Heading:3]]Power Cell[[/Heading]]
One of the machines in the hangar is the Power Cell. It is a heavily armored and extremely explosive machine, with a 20 radius 250 entropic damage explosion that will instantly destroy all hostiles in range. One of the [[Lab]] orders that are accessible when using the [[Data Conduit]] will provide a manual explosion code. The Power Cell Monitoring Terminal will accept this code and start a 20 turn countdown before the machine explodes.
[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There is only one exit in Section 7. The main access exit that leads to the next Research or [[Access]] floor can be found at a dead end of a 4 tile corridor near either the top-middle or bottom-middle of the map.","Redacted","","","","",""
"Storage","Location","Storage is an early game [[0b10]]-controlled [[Branch]] with no unique rewards but plenty of good prototype parts. Storage maps tend to be fairly cramped just like [[Materials]] maps but with fewer patrols and many more [[Y-45 Defender|Sentries]] guarding individual rooms and corridors. There is an unusually high number of [[A-02 Transporter|Haulers]] in these maps. Destroying them for their loot is highly recommended on -9 and -8. On -7 however, many of the Haulers will begin summoning [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcements]] that can cause trouble. The majority of the [[Prototype Part|Prototype Parts]] at this point in the game will be weapons or flight units, so players trying to prepare for a flight transition should consider visiting Storage on -9 or -8. Combat players should also consider Storage as a good way to stock up on early game weaponry. -7 Storage is considered generally inferior to [[Caves]] because Caves has the advantage of [[Alert]] reduction as well as unique branch rewards.
Storage is notable for the large number of prototype parts available. Unique shell and vaults contain many useful early game loot. Vaults can also contain out-of-depth parts. Storage is also notable for the mostly guaranteed [[Garrison (Machine)|Garrison]]. It is the only way to enter a Garrison on -9.

All of the special loot in Storage comes in the form of vaults and shells. The shells will only contain standard floor rating non-prototype and prototype parts. However, some of the vaults contain very out of depth prototype parts. The single item locked vault and the vault full of traps can contain rating 5* prototypes that are far out of depth compared to the normal Storage depths. These vaults can contain great items like [[Cld. Plasma Cannon]], [[Exp. Targeting Computer]], and even a semi-unique part [[Lgt. Regenerative Plating]]. Shells must be broke open by a weapon, while vaults must be hacked open via [[Terminal]]. Some vaults will already be open on entering the map.

When discovered, the 2 Derelicts will turn into uncontrollable allies and two assault [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]] will be summoned to the vault.[[/List]]","","","","","",""
"Subcaves","Location","Subcaves is an early game [[Branch]] that is guaranteed to appear on -10 every run, with exits being available from [[Materials]] and [[Mines]]. It is a dangerous map, containing a large number of [[Subdweller|Subdwellers]] that will attack Cogmind on sight. A few [[0b10]] patrols may roam the map, engaging wild [[Derelict|Derelicts]].
Unlike most maps, some areas may not be totally accessible in Subcaves without digging. Machinery strewn throughout the map can block passage to important areas. [[Artisan|Artisans]] will grow the machinery even more. Another unique bot presenter, [[Cobbler|Cobblers]], scoop up matter and produce random parts with their [[Cobbler Unit]].
It is easy to be overwhelmed by Subdwellers due to the overall low quality of parts available and relatively low core available on -10. Using Subdweller's weapons against them is recommended due to their high damage output. A [[Scrap Shield]] should always be used if it drops, since it will protect Cogmind's core and other parts well, and is easily repairable in the Subcaves.
[[Heading]]Unique Mechanics[[/Heading]]
One unique mechanic in this map is the ability to uncover new Subdwellers by digging. Be wary of summoning additional foes in this manner when trying to use [[Launchers]]. Any means of destroying terrain can trigger this effect.
Leaving partially damaged parts on the ground will cause ""Subatomizers"" to show up. They are invisible, and will gradually destroy any damaged parts left on the ground for too long.

A collection of 3 broken Subdwellers can found in Subcaves. Sometimes, they will spring to life when Cogmind comes near or attacks. If this happens, one of the Subdwellers will drop one of the 4L-MR0 prototypes. This can allow for a second prototype to be found in a single run.

"Testing","Location","Testing is a [[0b10]]-controlled [[Branch]] off of [[Research]] that appears on either -3 or -2. It is always on the floor that [[Quarantine]] is not on. Testing is a much smaller and generally much more manageable map compared to normal Research floors. There are few patrols, no [[Sentry]] or [[Heavy]] guards, and only a few special mini guard areas that can usually be easily avoided. There are unique [[Researcher]] bots that show up on this map that have dangerous effects when getting scanned. There are also powerful special and unique items that are not obtainable anywhere else. Even among normal parts, there is a much higher than usual chance of finding [[Prototype Part|Prototype Parts]] on the ground. Like all Research branches, [[Farcom]] will trigger [[Maximum Security]] upon entry.
Testing is home to the [[SGEMP Prototype]] that [[Zhirov]] asks for when you see him in his [[Zhirov (Location)|lab]]. It is guarded by 2 [[Striker|Strikers]] and an [[Alpha 7]]. The SGEMP always spawns in the vertically opposite corner of the map that Cogmind first spawns on. For example, if Cogmind would spawn in the top-left section of the map, the SGEMP would be in the bottom left. With the [[Phasing AFG]] and [[Portable AFG]], it is possible to retrieve the SGEMP without getting spotted at all. Otherwise the primary methods of obtaining are fighting the bots head-on or grabbing it and making a run for it.
[[Heading]]Getting Scanned[[/Heading]]
Attacking when in visual range of a Researcher or attacking a Researcher will result in them turning yellow and attempting to stasis and scan any hostiles. Whenever any bot is caught in stasis, the Researcher will summon a [[Reinforcement Squad]] to its current position. If Cogmind is scanned, it will also result in [[Q-Series]] being summoned instead of [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]]. These Q-Series have custom loadout that depends on Cogmind's current build.
Typically getting scanned is seen as a negative due to the high power level of Q-Series. Some builds might intentionally want to get scanned in order to get the Q-Series loot. To avoid unintentionally scanning, detach any ranged weapons whenever a Researcher is in line of sight of Cogmind. Melee weapons, special weapons like [[Datajacks]], and any type of guided weapon are safe to keep equipped to avoid misfires due to [[Corruption]].

[[Heading:2]][[Protovariant|Protovariants]][[/Heading]]
There can be up to 2 Protovariants on a Testing map. These are prototype superpowered versions of different bot classes that have a very strong loadout of high rating prototype parts. They are fearsome foes with high damage output and are quite difficult to take down compared to most bots but have incredible loot. They can spawn in one of 4 states: Unpowered, Dormant, Active, or Disabled/rewirable. Protovariants can be of the following types:
[[List]][[Protovariant D]]: Demolisher|[[Protovariant G]]: Grunt|[[Protovariant H]]: Hunter|[[Protovariant L]] Duelist|[[Protovariant P]]: Programmer|[[Protovariant X]]: Specialist|[[Protovariant Y]]: Sentry[[/List]]
In Testing there is a special hack that can appear on [[Terminal|Terminals]]: [[GameText]]Control(Protovariants)[[/GameText]]. If successfully performed, it will turn a Protovariant on the map hostile to everything. The Protovariant can make quite a mess of 0b10 bots, but may cause more trouble than it's worth. Researchers will report the bot repeatedly when they see it attack. There is a special assault [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] that gets dispatched to the Protovariant's location when this hack is performed. This ARC contains an [[Investigator]] inside that will scan Cogmind even without being provoked. Sometimes a Protovariant will enter the out of control state even if Cogmind does not perform the [[GameText]]Control(Protovariants)[[/GameText]] hack.
[[Heading:2]]Testing Shells[[/Heading]]
The majority of unique Testing items appear in Reinforced Shells. There are no identifying features that indicate the contents of these Shells. The list of unique Testing items contained within are:

There are 2 unique prefabs that do not contain any of the above items and have their own list. One prefab has 1-2 [[Potential Cannon|Potential Cannons]] or [[Imp. Potential Cannon|Imp. Potential Cannons]] (not necessarily the same type) and several [[Imp. Energy Well|Imp]], [[Adv. Energy Well|Adv.]], or [[Exp. Energy Well|Exp. Energy Wells]]. The other shell is locked behind Sealed Heavy Doors and has a special Researcher behind. The Terminal can be hacked to open the doors, but the Researcher will make it difficult to break the Shell without getting scanned. However, penetrating the heavy doors first will allow safely killing the Researcher. It is also possible to dig in to the back of the prefab directly into the Shell area. The shell will always contain [[SHELL Armor]] and 3 random pieces of [[Lgt. Regenerative Plating]], [[Med. Regenerative Plating]], or [[Hvy. Regenerative Plating]]. The Terminal on the inside of the shell contains schematic for some of the regenerative platings.

"Warlord (Location)","Location","The Warlord base is a [[Caves]] [[Branch]] that appears on -5 or -4 and is named after the eponymous bot [[Warlord]]. This map is home to a large number of [[Derelict|Derelicts]] allied with Warlord and ready to fight. This branch is much more combat-oriented than many of the other Caves branches, with large waves of [[0b10]] bots assaulting the base. Initially the map is totally safe and filled with friendly NPCs, but after one of several conditions is met a large assault will begin.
The right side of the map is the same every run. There is a small cave-like area with an exit just above the starting area. There are a few [[Dirty Bomb Trap|Dirty Bomb Traps]] spread around this section of the map, so be prepared if Cogmind has any [[Corruption]]. There are two entrances into the base: The first has some doors blocking a large corruption-cleansing System Quarantine Field Array, some opened Blast Doors, and a second set of regular doors opening up into 2 [[Marauder (6)|Marauders]]. This entrance has a large number of [[Fire Trap|Fire Traps]] installed. The second way in is either on the top or the bottom of the map, hidden behind some fake walls. These will automatically open if approached from the inside of the base. Behind these fake walls are a set of Sealed Heavy Doors, followed by one more set of fake walls. If Cogmind is [[RIF]] aligned, they will be detected and the entire base will be turned hostile. This occurs no matter which entrance is taken. It is safe to get the corruption cleanse, but any further will be dangerous.
The interior of the base is different every run. There are always 2 guaranteed rooms in every run. The first is the Vortex Lab which is locked behind Sealed Heavy Doors with a [[Terminal]] to open it next to them. Inside are some [[Tinkerer|Tinkerers]], a lore Terminal, and a random assortment of Vortex weaponry. There will always be at least one pair of weapons from the following list:
[[List]][[Vortex Cannon]]|[[Vortex Driver]]|[[Vortex Lance]]|[[Vortex Rail]]|[[Vortex Rifle]]|[[Vortex Shotgun]][[/List]]
There may also be a single [[Vortex Catalyst Activator]], and if this is a seed where the [[Exiles (Group)|Exiles]] abandoned their hideout, [[EX-DEC]] will be present along with a [[BFG-9k Vortex Edition]]. The other guaranteed room is Warlord's throne room. In it are Warlord himself, 6 [[Thug (7)|Thugs]], 2 [[Knight|Knights]], [[God Mode (Fake)|Fake God Mode]], and Warlord's stash. The stash is locked by Sealed Heavy Doors. The Terminal can be hacked open with a special code obtained at a Terminal in [[Data Miner (Location)]].
The contents of Warlord's stash will vary every game with only the Vortex Chain Reactor being guaranteed. The contents can be as follows:
[[List]](guaranteed) [[Vortex Chain Reactor]]|[[Adv. Remote Shield]] or [[Imp. Energy Mantle]]|[[Exp. Phase Shifter]], [[Exp. Targeting Computer]], or [[Exp.

[[Heading]]Alignment - [[Warlord (Alignment)|Warlord]][[/Heading]]
After entering Warlord's throne room, he will explain his plan to attack upper 0b10. As long as he survives until Cogmind exits the map and the 0b10 forces attack, he will attack on -2 [[Research]]. This will occur even if you turn the Warlord forces hostile before exiting the map. Keep in mind, it is possible for a fast Flight build to leave before the assault begins which will prevent the invasion. Along with this Research event, there is another event in [[Command]] that this affects: [[Redacted]]When the Command cave seals are opened, [[Warlord (Command)]] will pop out along with various other Warlord-aligned Derelicts.[[/Redacted]] This alignment is incompatible with RIF or attacking [[Scraptown]] as Warlord will be hostile when entering the base. It is also incompatible with [[Imprint]] or [[UFD]] alignment, as Warlord will not be happy talking with Cogmind. If the [[Encrypted Comm Array]] has been obtained, Warlord will thank Cogmind for assisting his forces. At this point, no more forces will be summonable and the Array can be dropped.

[[List]]Moving 575 tiles|Being on the map for 1300 turns|Visiting Warlord in his throne room|Opening up the Vortex Lab[[/List]]
After any of these conditions is met, large groups of 0b10 forces will come from an opening in either the top-right, middle-right, or bottom-right section of the map. These bots roam around the map randomly in groups, but usually come straight through the main entrance. When this happens, a large group of [[Bouncer|Bouncers]] will join the existing Marauder guards at the front gate. The first wave will usually be decimated by the entryway traps, but many more will follow.
There are a total of 14 assault waves, although it is highly recommended to leave the map before that many enemy bots appear. 10 turns after the first [[GameText]]MAIN.C incursion imminent.

[[Image]]Warlord Wall Lure.png|Luring hostiles around the wall[[/Image]]Staying and fighting near the main entryway is one of the best approaches to fighting the waves off. Join in with [[Launchers]] if you have them, but make sure to watch out for friendly fire. There is a bit of leeway, but hitting allies too many times will be considered a betrayal. Demolishers and Programmers are the highest priority targets since they can cause a lot of damage with Launchers and robot hacking respectively. Throwing Claymores and the Vortex Catalyst Activator that can both be obtained on this map are great options to destroy waves with ease. [[Visual Processing Units]] coupled with long ranged weapons are another good option to sit back and snipe bots from outside their typical range. The entrance defense is quite strong and will perform well most of the time. However, a squad of Programmers with an unlucky chain-assimilation of bots or some unchecked Demolishers will quickly tear any defense to pieces.
Even a build with little offensive power can help out in this part of the defense. Getting spotted first will cause hostiles to prioritize Cogmind for a while, even if they are getting shot by something else. This means that the Warlord bots can blast away all the hostiles while they are trying to run after you. This can work well for combat builds too, especially for combat hostiles without launchers of their own.
[[Heading:2]]Counterattack[[/Heading]]
In between the 4th and 5th waves, a Derelict will appear next to Cogmind to leave the base with the counterattack for cover. At this point, the majority of the combat Derelicts except for the guard Marauders and Bouncers will begin to head outside of the base. The strength of the counterattacks depends on a lot of factors. If the defense falters early on, the counterattack can get caught up fighting a bunch of squads and never make it out the entrance. Their tendency to trickle to the fight can be a big weakness if the hostiles are bunched up and can quickly take out Derelicts one at a time. On the other hand, [[Sapper|Sappers]] will dramatically increase the strength of any counterattack and can destroy big groups of bots on their own. 
The counterattack is usually a good time to exit the map whether it's successful or not. For airborne builds especially, even if the counterattack dies early on it can serve as a good distraction as you fly by.
[[Heading:2]]Base Infiltration[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Warlord Enhanced Allies.png|Enhanced Allies[[/Image]]In between the 7th and 8th assault waves is the final event of the map. A random spot in the Warlord base will be infiltrated and hostile assault squads will begin to appear from that location too with the announcement [[GameText]]Base interior infiltrated, regroup at designated outer cave rendezvous points[[/GameText]]. At the same time, a friendly group of 3 [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]] and 3 [[Enhanced Demolisher|Enhanced Demolishers]] will teleport into Warlord's throne room to assist. 2 of the Demolishers will immediately head toward the exit while the remaining bots follow Warlord around. At this point, all surviving Derelicts will head toward Warlord as he makes his way over to the map exit.
This is the last chance to exit the map with any amount of assistance. With assaults pouring in from the main entrance and a spot in the base itself, it is time to go. The Enhanced Demolishers have incredible loot including [[Cmb. Linear Gravjet|Cmb. Linear Gravjets]], [[Centrium Medium Armor Plating]], [[Coolant Network]], and the unique [[Chain Missile Launcher]].","Spoiler","","","","",""
"Wastes","Location","Wastes is a [[0b10]]-controlled sub-floor in Factory that appears on most floors between -7 and -4. It can only be entered when Cogmind triggers a [[Chute Trap]]. Cogmind will get dropped in instantly, and any nearby allies or bots who have previously triggered a chute trap will also appear over time. Wastes can be a very brutal map for an unprepared player. There are 6 hostile [[C-40 Crusher|Crushers]] that can decimate Cogmind's build in a few hits. There is an EMP that is on in some Wastes maps that fires every 100 turns and adds between 5 to 10% [[Corruption]] to Cogmind. This corruption can be reduced by EM [[Resistance Devices]] and [[Dynamic Insulation Systems]]. There are various broken, faulty, or otherwise low integrity parts scattered on the ground. These parts can be several ratings out of depth and can be good to try to repair or scan and fabricate.
The layout of this map is semi-fixed. The entrance, exits, and general layouts of the map are similar, although the exact layout can vary a bit in which way paths are connected. There are wide 4 tile corridors that sometimes have 8 by 8 tile wide dead ends on the far ends of the map. Cogmind spawns on the left side, and the exit will always be in an 8 by 8 tile section on the right side of the map.

[[Heading]]Variations[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Wastes Allies.png|[[Derelict|Derelicts]] hiding in the walls waiting to attack[[/Image]][[Image]]Wastes Allies Waiting.png|Allies that invaded chutes waiting for Cogmind[[/Image]]
There are 4 primary variations of Wastes:
[[List]]Standard: The EMP is on, Crushers are present, and there are no allies.|EMP + allies: The EMP is on, Crushers are present, and there are Derelict allies hiding in the walls. The Derelicts will burst out of their hiding spot when coming near them. There is a small stash of weapons and armor in their hiding spot.|No EMP + allies: The EMP is disabled, Crushers are present, and there are Derelict allies hiding in the walls.|No EMP + raided: The EMP is disabled but there are no alive Crushers or Derelicts on the map. Some damaged Crusher loot and broken Crushers and Derelicts are present. Broken crushers may suddenly reactivate if Cogmind gets too close.|No EMP + raided + allies: The EMP is disabled, there are no alive Crushers, but there is a group of Derelicts waiting for Cogmind.[[/List]]
[[Heading]]Strategy[[/Heading]]
If Cogmind is airborne the strategy is usually pretty simple. Either try to search the big map endings where the Derelict allies spawn from or make a beeline for the exit on the right of the map. The Derelicts will usually take out most of the Crushers without any assistance.If trying to fly by, the Crushers do not have the most intelligent movement and can often be juked by luring them to one side of a corridor and then crossing by the other side out of reach. Circling back may be needed to avoid groups of Crushers. If the EMP is off, Cogmind might be able to kite the Crushers indefinitely in order to shoot them to death with any ranged weapon. Otherwise, the best bet is usually to head straight for the exit to avoid getting too much corruption.
Dealing with Crushers on combat is typically a much more daunting task. Crushers are slow moving, but incredibly tanky and difficult to kill through conventional means. One good strategy to kill them are critical destroy weapons such as a [[8R-AWN's Boregun]], [[Hyp. Gauss Rifle]], or [[Hyp. Gauss Cannon]]. While the armor can't be crit, the core and compactor exposure are about 23% together, and getting a critical hit on either one is as good as a kill. To avoid corruption when the EMP is on, put on a [[Damper Plating]] as soon as possible after killing a Crusher. Getting an early crit can result in some very high integrity Damper Plating drops. Another strategy is a meltdown build. 3 or more thermal guns can overheat the Crushers and cause them to melt.
[[Image]]Wastes Crusher Lure.png|Crusher loop strategy[[/Image]]Fighting Crushers head on without enough firepower can usually result in Cogmind losing their build. One way to hedge your bets is to lure the Crushers in a circle around the starting corner of the map. You can shoot the Crusher around the walls and through a tunnel you create. See the image on the right as a reference. The Crushers is forced to take the long path around while you can take the short path. This technique is a little risky as it is possible to get totally surrounded by multiple Crushers.
Sometimes the best option is simply to detach all parts and make a run for it. If the EMP is off, dropping parts in the corner of the map preemptively is a good idea. If the Derelict allies are on the map, they can clear out most of the Crushers for you so you can go back and pick up your parts later. Even if there are no allies around, being able to pick the parts that you want to take is a lot better than having all your parts crushed and being stuck with only junk.
Using [[RIF]] along with a [[Datajacks|Datajack]] and [[Relay Coupler [NC]|NC Couplers]] makes each Crusher neutral for 3 charges a pieces. This makes the Crushers trivial to loot for maximum salvage, although the EMP can still make the process be quite annoying. Ramming these bots when neutralized this way is safe to do if running low on matter.","","","","","",""
"Zhirov (Location)","Location","Zhirov is a [[Caves]] [[Branch]] that appears on -5 or -4 and is home to the eponymous bot [[Zhirov]]. This is a safe map with no hostile spawns and only friendly bots, although Cogmind should be wary of [[Corruption]] triggering misfires that anger Zhirov. Detaching all ranged weapons is advised.
This map initially appears to be a small section of caves with only an exit. Approaching the left wall will cause the cave walls to slide away to reveal some Cloak Generators and some larger Sealed Heavy Doors blocking the way. These Cloak Generators surround the entire outside of Zhirov's lab. Continuing to the left will cause the doors to slide down and reveal Zhirov himself who will greet you. [[Perun]] and [[Svarog]] guard just above and below the entrance on the left side.
There are a large collection of [[Terminal|Terminals]] to the left of Zhirov. The first terminal going counterclockwise contains some lore records and the depths of, [[Quarantine]], [[Testing]], and [[Command]]. The second contains Analyses for [[Q-Series]], [[Striker|Strikers]], [[Executioner|Executioners]], and [[Alpha 7|Alpha 7s]]. The third contains 4 Prototype ID Banks. The fourth contains Schematics for an [[Assault Drone Bay]], [[Exp. Heat Sink]], [[Exp. Optical Array]], and [[Imp. Arc Thrower]]. This is the only way that Assault Drone Bays can be obtained. In the room just below this, there is a series of 3 Terminals that describe Zhirov's past since arriving on Tau Ceti IV.
Near the center area there are two [[Alien Artifacts]] with explanatory Terminals. The left will either be an [[Integrated Reactor]] or an [[Integrated Dissipator]]. The right will always be a [[Transdimensional Reconstructor]].
At the bottom of the map are some broken bots and an assorted collection of parts. None of these parts are guaranteed, although there will always be some available. The list of available parts is as follows:
[[List]][[Adv. Myomer Leg]], [[Cld. Gravmag System]], or [[Cld. Nuclear Pulse Thruster]]|[[Fusion Reactor]] or [[Hvy. Antimatter Reactor]]|[[Adv. Energy Well]], or [[Adv. Power Amplifier]]|[[Exp. Core Shielding]], [[Exp. Power Shielding]], [[Exp. Propulsion Shielding]], [[Exp. Utility Shielding]], or [[Exp. Weapon Shielding]]|[[Particle Accelerator]], [[Prc. Matter Filter]], or [[Imp. Matter Compressor]]|[[Adv. System Shield]] or [[Adv. Hacking Suite]][[/List]]
[[Image]]Zhirov Explosion.gif|Zhirov leaving with flair[[/Image]]
Unlike the Cloak Generators in [[Zion]], these machines are the real deal. If destroyed, there are some major consequences that follow. Zhirov and friends will immediately turn aggressive and begin to attack. A large group of friendly [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]] wil teleport in and start attacking Zhirov. Zhirov will attempt to teleport out when his core integrity gets to about half. He will first say [[GameText]]Looks like we have to say goodbye to this place, and you[[/GameText]]. This will rig a large number of explosions to go off in about 10 turns. This happens even if the Cloak Generators are already intact and Zhirov is attacked.
[[Heading]][[Zhirov (Alignment)|Alignment - Zhirov]][[/Heading]][[Image]]Testing SGEMP.png|The SGEMP room in Testing[[/Image]]
After entering and exiting the Terminal room, Zhirov will ask Cogmind to steal the [[SGEMP Prototype]] from Testing and bring it to [[Access]]. If done, Zhirov, Perun, and Svarog will show up in Access and will give Cogmind perfect map intel and follow until Zhirov falls below half core integrity. If a [[Core Reset Matrix]] is used prior to Access but Cogmind still carries the SGEMP, Zhirov and his allies will turn hostile and fight Cogmind to the death instead.
There is a second part of this quest that continues in [[Command]]. [[Redacted]]After destroying the first form of [[MAIN.C (Shell)|MAIN.C]] in Command, Zhirov, Perun, and Svarog will show up and Zhirov will activate the Modified SGEMP and disable all 0b10-aligned bots on the map.[[/Redacted]]
[[Heading]]Fighting[[/Heading]]
Fighting Zhirov and gaining anything from the encounter is not an easy task. Although he has some nice loot, his tendency to teleport out at the slightest hint of danger and explosive aftermath even on a successful kill is very frustrating to deal with. One option is to loot Perun and Svarog while ignoring Zhirov and simply exiting the map safely. These 2 can still have some good parts, although they have nothing as lucrative as Zhirov with the guaranteed inventory drops of [[Deep Network Scanner]], [[Quantum Router]], a [[Transdimensional Reconstructor]], and a [[Zhirov Special]]. Only Zhirov can set off the traps and cause the group to leave.
The best way to safely grab all the loot is with [[Master Tearclaws]] that can be looted from [[Master Thief|Master Thieves]]. These Tearclaws can strip all 3 bots of their parts with little risk of explosives. Just make sure Zhirov doesn't fall below 80 core integrity. The Tearclaws can even remove the inventory items without requiring Zhirov to actually be destroyed. The idea is to shoot one of the bots from just outside of one of the rooms and then retreat behind one of the doorways. This will let you safely use the melee Tearclaws while only getting attacked by 1 bot at a time.","Spoiler","","","","",""
"Zion","Location","Zion is a [[Caves]] [[Branch]] that appears on -7 or -6 and is the home to a large number of [[Derelict]] [[Zionite|Zionites]]. It is a general safe haven for all types of Derelict bots and has a ton of lore available by talking with all sorts of Zionites. Similar to Caves, [[Scrap]] and [[Derelict Log|Derelict Logs]] can appear on the ground here. Aside from one relatively harmless event, there are no hostile bots that appear on this map unless Cogmind attacks or attempts to enter while aligned with [[RIF]] or after becoming hostile to the [[UFD]]. The System Quarantine Field Array at the entrance of the map will cleanse all [[Corruption]]. It is strongly recommended to detach any ranged weapons until cleansing corruption to avoid any misfires that will turn the map hostile. RIF-aligned or UFD-hostile Cogmind can only go as far as triggering the cleanse at the quarantine array. Going any further will turn Zion hostile.
Zion maps are randomly generated but will always have the same overall appearance. There is a small Caves-like section on the east containing the spawn point and exit to Proximity Caves. To the left is the Quarantine Array machine guarded by 2 friendly [[Marauder (6)|Marauders]]. The bulk of Zion is contained within a large hollow square shape. All of the unique prefabs are contained within this area of the map. To the top left is the locked entrance to the [[Zion Deep Caves]]. Below that is a [[Tinkerer]] next to the Conduit Teleporter, 4 [[Mutant (6)|Mutants]], the [[Imprinter]], and some more Tinkerers next to the Imprinting Machine.
[[Heading]]Alignment - [[Imprint|Imprinting]][[/Heading]]Walking into the Imprinting machine will allow Cogmind to Imprint which has some major gameplay effects. The main change is that Cogmind can no longer use normal hacks at [[Terminal|Terminals]] and can now only use a specific set of randomized Zionite hacks. The 4 Mutants that guard the Imprinter will also turn purple and begin to follow you. There is an additional unique effect in [[Command]]: [[Redacted]]When the Command cave seals are opened, powerful Zionite bots will pop out along with various other Zionite-aligned Derelicts. These Zionites will be controllable (blue) rather than purple if a [[Core Reset Matrix]] is used.[[/Redacted]] This alignment has the following incompatibilities:
[[List]][[Farcom]]: The Imprinter will warn a Farcom-aligned Cogmind against trying to use the machine. If the machine is used anyway, the Zionites will take it as an attack and turn hostile.|RIF: A RIF-aligned Cogmind will turn Zion hostile when attempting to enter in the first place.|[[Revision 17]]: Revision 17 will be afraid of an imprinted Cogmind and will not attack -3 [[Research]].|[[Scraptown]] hostilities: Zion will become hostile to Cogmind who has become hostile to the UFD.|[[UFD]]: If Cogmind is a UFD member, The Imprinter will tell Cogmind that the imprinting machine vetting process will take a while and to come back another time.|[[Warlord]]: Warlord will be disappointed in an imprinted Cogmind and will not attack -2 Research.[[/List]]
[[Heading]]Fighting[[/Heading]]
Fighting Zion can be a risky feat for an unprepared Cogmind, but not particularly challenging if going in with a plan. The majority of the [[Zionite|Zionites]] are initially unarmed, although they can scavenge through the Twisted Machinery tiles in order to find several (usually weak) types of guns or melee weapons. Zionites will also appear out of the machinery tiles and instantly attack. This will only happen if Cogmind is within a few tiles of some machinery, so using explosive weaponry on these tiles is highly recommended to avoid unnecessarily fighting extra bots. It is not possible to destroy this machinery beforehand, as destroying too many of these tiles will cause Zion to turn hostile. After attacking, use launchers to take the machines out at range to avoid getting sneak attacked.
One of the largest benefits and threats to fighting Zion is the [[Z-Hero]] spawn. There is a chance that a hostile Hero will spawn at the Caves exit and roam around the map. It is important to have a plan to deal with some of the stronger Heroes like [[99-TNT]] and [[P1-3CE]], even if that plan is only to spot them first and run to avoid getting spotted in return. Other heroes like [[ME-RLN]] are easier to kill. All of them can provide incredibly strong unique loot. Another big reason to fight is the [[Imprinter Data Core]] that will guarantee access to the [[Zion Deep Caves]] if no other methods are available. One thing to note is that the Imprinter will not stick around long after attack. 300 turns after Cogmind angers Zion, the Imprinter will disappear and it will not be possible to get her Data Core. Starting hostilities by attacking her is recommended for this reason.

There are a wide variety of encounters in Zion. A few are useless, some are more niche, but most are going to have a use in many builds. Every game has a half dozen or so of these encounters available and it is likely that most builds will get something nice out of the trip.
[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There are 2 types of exits in Zion:[[List]][[Proximity Caves]] exit: This exit is on the top right side of the map near where Cogmind spawns.|[[Zion Deep Caves]] exit: This exit is on the top left side of the map protected by locked blast doors. The doors can be unlocked with a random Derelict event that will provide the hacking codes or with the same codes obtained by using the [[Imprinter Data Core]]. Additionally, the doors can be broken into with a very powerful Impact ([[Impact Mace]] or stronger) weapon, an overloadable Thermal cannon like a [[Cld. Particle Cannon]], or by using a [[Plasma Cutters|Plasma Cutter]]. The Sealed Blast Doors have an armor value of 45 with 0% thermal resistance but many other strong resistances.[[/List]][[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]
[[List]](+/-) [[Hunter]] attack: A Hunter disguised as a Derelict will sneak up to the gates of Zion and attack the Marauder guards. This will usually result in the quarantine array being destroyed and the Hunter losing the fight. The dropped parts can be collected by Cogmind but will quickly self-destruct.[[/List]]","Spoiler","","","","",""
"Zion Deep Caves","Location","The Zion Deep Caves, or ZDC, is a [[Branch]] off of [[Zion]] that seems to serve as a sort of base of operations for the [[Imprinter]] and the Zionites. This is a very combat oriented map that requires a lot of preparation to complete entirely. It is possible for a very fast flight build to sneak in, grab one or two things, and escape, but the presence of the perfect-tracking 24 speed [[Z-Imprinter]] makes things tough.
The bulk of the map has a predefined layout except for the right starting point and middle-left exit area which are slightly different every time. These two random areas are mostly empty but can contain small groups of [[Assembled (4)|Assembled]] and a disabled [[Surveybot 24]]. To the left of the starting area are a big Z-Facility machine, a huge explosive Z-Power, and some [[Z-Technician|Z-Technicians]] working on the machine. Above and below are [[Z-Light (5)|Z-Light]] guards. On the top and left side there are Zionite item stashes. To the left side of the exit area is a collection of assorted broken Derelict bots and highly damaged parts. There is an [[Exiles (Location)|Exiles]] item near the top of the area. The far left is an Impregnable Wall which contains a large amount of Assembled and 2 [[Assembler|Assemblers]]. The wall is guarded by a [[Golem]] above and below. There are also some Wall Chambers that drop [[GOLEM Unit|GOLEM Units]] when destroyed. The units will start regrowing into hostile Golems.
While quite challenging, there are some very strong unique rewards on this map. GOLEM units are only available here and can provide a strong build in a-box. [[Asb. Focal Cannon|Focal Cannons]] will tear through most anything in the game quite easily. The [[Asb. Combat Suite]] is a unique part that combines [[Phase Shifters]], [[Targeting Computers]], and [[Core Analyzers]] in a single slot. The [[Surveybot 24 Chip]] is the strongest type of [[Terrain Scan Processors|Terrain Scan Processor]] in the game. [[Zio. Weapon Casing|Weapon Casings]] can protect late-game super-weapons from harm. The [[Zio. Biocell]] is an early way to gain a mostly identical [[Exp. Energy Well]] early in the game.
[[Heading]]Strategy[[/Heading]]
There are some key requirements to deal with each section of this map and common approaches for dealing with each. Here is a general checklist of things that will be useful throughout the map:
[[List]]Propulsion/Weapon/Armor + backups: You will do a lot of fighting in this map. Having backups of these more important parts will keep you alive.|[[Launchers]]: These can be used for the Z-Imprinter, Z-Lights, and especially for the Assembled in the wall. Multiple backups are recommended.|EM weapons: EM is the only effective way to fight Golems. EM traps like [[EM Surge Trap|EM Surge]] or [[Dirty Bomb Trap|Dirty Bombs]] can also be used but having at least 1 EM weapon is best to be safe.|(Optional) [[AS-neutralizer No. 17b]]: Completely neutralizes the threat of the Assembled wall.|(Optional) Allies: Makes the opening Z-Imprinter fight much easier to handle.|(Optional) Dead [[Imprinter]]: Killing the Imprinter in Zion prevents her from showing up in this map. She has no weapons in Zion so taking her out there can be an easy way to skip a big threat on this map.[[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]Starting Area[[/Heading:2]]
There isn't much threat here. There can be groups of 3 Assembled that can be easily dispatched by any weapons, although Launchers are most effective.
[[Image]]ZDC Allies.png|Fighting the Z-Imprinter with allies[[/Image]][[Image]]ZDC Imprinter Launcher.png|Aiming past the Imprinter with a Launcher[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]][[Z-Imprinter]][[/Heading:2]]
After entering the main open area of the map, the Z-Imprinter will spawn and head directly to Cogmind's location. 2 Z-Lights will follow the Imprinter but are much slower and will take some time to arrive. The Z-Imprinter has high evasion, 150 core integrity, and deals a large amount of damage every volley. Allies are highly recommended for this fight to help destroy her quicker and to draw fire from you. The Derelict ally events from Zion can help, as can the A8 code [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]]. Use the code on any of the gate terminals on the entrance to this map. A [[Tactical Coordination Suite]] can really help out with an ally damage. [[Targeting Computers]] or 2-slot Treads with [[Siege Mode]] are also recommended to be able to hit the Imprinter more frequently.
For Cogmind's build, any non-EM and non-Impact damage types will work. To get the [[Zio. Metafield Generator]], +Salvage is recommended by using guns with the best available type of [[Salvage Targeting Computers|Salvage Targeting Computer]]. Although it doesn't deal much damage, EM can be used to apply +Salvage if allies are providing enough damage output otherwise. If salvage isn't needed, using Explosive Launchers will be very effective here. Rather than aiming directly at the Imprinter, aim the launcher at a wall or at the end of its range so that the Imprinter is still hit close to the source. This will maintain a high accuracy while still dealing the bulk of the damage to the Imprinter. This technique can also be used against the Z-Lights to good effect.
After the Z-Imprinter is dead, take care that your allies don't spot the Z-Technicians by the Z-Power machine. They will almost assuredly miss into the machine and end up nuking themselves, and if you're not careful, Cogmind. Beware its large 15 tile radius.
[[Heading:2]][[Z-Light]] Guards[[/Heading]]The top and bottom of the map have groups of 3 Z-Light guards. There are 2 groups on the top and one on the bottom. All of these are optional encounters. To avoid them, dig through the center of the Z-Facility and hang near the left side of the area. Enter the tunnel near the top side to avoid getting spotted by the bottom group. The top Z-Lights are often worth fighting because of the large number of special Zionite parts they guard. It is possible to reach the first alcove on the top without getting spotted, but the remainder are all guarded
If Cogmind still has strong allies like Enhanced Grunts alive from the Z-Light encounter, it is possible to just charge in and fight them all at once. They are not as dangerous as the Z-Imprinter, but in large numbers they can still pack a punch. Using Launchers is very effective on these bots since they don't tend to be very tanky as long as you can actually hit them. Using a [[Transmission Jammers|Transmission Jammer]] to lure them 1 at a time can also be an effective strategy if fighting with non-launcher weapons to preserve salvage.
[[Heading:2]]Exit Area[[/Heading]]
Same as the starting area, the only threat here is small groups of 3 Assembled.
[[Heading:2]][[Golem|Golems]][[/Heading]]
Golems are incredibly tanky enemies with an extreme damage output and the source of many lost runs. In order to claim a GOLEM Unit or the Exiles item, Cogmind must fight or at least run past them. Conventional weapons do not work at all here. With a 10% core exposure, 200 core integrity, and 15% damage resistance to non-melee damage types, trying to fight fairly is suicide. The best approach is EM damage or Impact. Golems only require an average of 118 damage to corrupt them to death compared to thousands of damage with non-EM weapons. Using [[Zio. Weapon Casing|Weapon Casings]] looted earlier may be helpful here to avoid losing your only way to fight.
Due to uneven calculations for line-of-sight and weapon range, it is possible to shoot the Golems once before you are spotted at 16 range. See the Golem 1/2 spots below for reference. This allows Cogmind to wait 2 turns before shooting to avoid any movement accuracy penalties, since every turn counts particularly hard when fighting a Golem. If using EM traps, short ranged EM weapons, or Impact weapons, see the lure images for reference. This will get Cogmind spotted, likely get shot at for 1 volley, and then draw the Golem in closer. This can avoid misses or misfires opening the GOLEM Unit chambers and accidentally triggering the wall early. However, keep in mind that if Cogmind misses or if the Golem misfires into one of the chambers, the wall will open instantly. Luring the Golems out of range where they can attack the GOLEM Unit containers is recommended. The Exiles item will typically require fighting the top Golem, but getting a GOLEM unit typically requires fighting both Golems.

[[Heading:2]][[Assembled (4)|Assembled]] Wall[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]ZDC Wall Activation Zone.png|Approximate wall activation zone[[/Image]]
The Assembled wall is an indestructible wall containing 35 Assembled and 2 [[Assembler|Assemblers]] that will automatically open up when Cogmind gets too close to it, or if any of the GOLEM Unit chambers are destroyed. See the image on the right for a range reference. This range encompasses the GOLEM Unit containers, so fighting the wall is typically required to grab them.
Fighting the wall practically requires Launchers to avoid becoming overwhelmed. Any kinds of launchers work, although explosive launchers are better due to their higher range and base damage. Trying to use launchers at a range where they won't miss and take out the GOLEM unit containers is ideal. Otherwise it can be slightly annoying up to even deadly to have a large number of growing Golems running around. They grow slowly, but trying to deal with the Assembled and growing Golems at the same time can be a recipe for disaster. Alternately, the [[AS-neutralizer No. 17b]] can be used here to almost entirely eliminate any threat of the wall. The Assemblers will still need to be destroyed, but the rest of the Assembled will become useless.
[[Heading:2]]Loot[[/Heading]]
After everything else is cleaned out, all that's left is claiming the loot. Wall Chambers will drop [[GOLEM Unit|GOLEM Units]] when destroyed. They will turn into a Golem in a few turns, so grab them quickly. They can drop their GOLEM Unit upon being destroyed (standard loot rules), so applying positive and negative Salvage affects Golem reformation. Using melee weapons is recommended to avoid missing into other containers and spawning further Golems.
The Exiles item will normally require fighting both the wall and the top Golem. One alternative to grab it is using the Zion special item [[Phasing AFG]]. By using it, the item can be pulled in without any fighting on the left side of the map.

[[List]](++) [[5H-AD0]]: When entering, 5H-AD0 will join Cogmind in investigating the map. They will leave after exiting the map or when they fall below approximately half core integrity.
