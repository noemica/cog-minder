"Access","Location","Access is the last [[0b10]]-controlled main floor that only appears on -1. Access is the most challenging main map with increased patrol density, number of bots per patrol, map size, and level and difficulty in hackable machines compared to [[Research]]. These maps have a 150x300 tile size, either being a tall vertical level or a wide horizontal level. Access maps tend to be fairly well connected across corridors and rooms, and have fewer large rooms and larger hallways more similar to [[Factory]] than the cramped maze-like layout of Research. There are only 2 exits in Access, and locating and taking the desired exit can be especially challenging.
In contrast with the small number of exits, Access has the highest number of [[Garrison Access|Garrisons]] with 6 machines spread throughout the level. Shutting or destroying Garrisons is always a good idea, but there is a special interaction in Access: [[Spoiler]]If all 6 Garrisons are shut down or disabled, [[Maximum Security]] will be triggered, sending huge waves of hostiles directly to Cogmind. Either be prepared to fight your way out, or have an escape route planned for a fast airborne build to avoid engaging in combat.[[/Spoiler]]
The biggest bot upgrade in Access is the [[Behemoth]] change. All Behemoths will become [[B-99 Colossus|Colossi]], extremely dangerous and hard to kill threats. They have some incredibly good loot, but trying to kill them with conventional methods is difficult due to their high damage output, high integrity, and [[Adv. Force Field]] reducing damage they take. Avoiding them or running if spotted is usually the best plan.
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
There is one special machine in Access. The Energy Cycler is a large explosive machine that appears in rooms with a 2 tile wide doorway. When it is destroyed, several [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]] will spawn from Garrisons and start roaming around the map. Additionally, all of the sealed heavy doors on the map will retract, allowing access to exits.

[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There are 2 types of exits on Access floors. Both exits can be identified by long 2 tile wide corridors leading to the [[Terminal]]-locked side of the exits. They are both identifiable by look alone:
[[List]][[Surface]] exit: There are 2 sides to this Surface exit. One side is locked behind an 80 armor Sealed Barrier locked by a [[Terminal]] with a base 7% open chance. The other side has Sealed Heavy Doors that are much easier to break through, but is guarded by 2 Colossi. Blowing up the Energy Cyclers will open only the side with the Sealed Barrier. Trying to rush head-on past the Behemoths is usually not recommended due to their extreme damage output and heavy knockback.|[[Redacted]][[Command]] exit: There are 2 sides to this Command exit. One side has a 2 tile snaking corridor that has 3 consecutive Sealed Barriers. Each has a base 30% open chance. The other side has a single row of Sealed Heavy Doors, a guard area with 2 Terminators and 2 Colossi, and 3 more Sealed Heavy Doors blocking the exit. Blowing up the Energy Cycler will only open the side with the 3 Sealed Barriers.[[/Redacted]][[/List]]

"Access_0","Location","Access_0 is a non-[[0b10]] [[Branch]] off of [[Command]] that only appears on -1. It is the home to the [[Architect]], the [[A Bots]], and several types of Enhanced bots. Access_0 is a very heavily combat-oriented map that has 2 unique wintypes available and has the Architect present, a special boss bot that will award a + on the scoresheet when defeated. It features a multitude of unique bots, a unique bossfight mechanic, and many of the strongest hostiles in the game to fight.
The overall structure of Access_0 can be split into 2 groups with a small bridge connecting section guarded by [[A2]].

[[Heading]]Layout[[/Heading]]
The bulk of the map is on the right side, with the bridge dividing a small section of the left side of the map. Overall, the layout is comparable to a more maze-like [[Caves]]. There are many dead ends and nearly-connected areas that can be safely dug out when noticed with terrain scanning. Cogmind spawns on the right side of the map along with the Architect, [[A8]], and 2 [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]]. The right side of the map can contain [[Alien Artifacts|Alien Artifact]]-containing Workstation machines, large item caches on the ground or in Reinforced Shells, random bits of machinery, and Subspace Access Nodes. Typically, there are 4 Access Nodes on the right side of the map, although very rarely one can appear on the left. Otherwise, the left side can contain all the same things that the right side has and a few more. The left side will always contain a Singularity Gate machine along with a Gate Controls Terminal that can control it. At the bottom left of the map, there is an Architect Logs Terminal wrapped in a 120 armor Architect Shell.
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:3]]Subspace Access Node[[/Heading]]
There are 4 of these Access Nodes, also known as ""pads"" on the map. They serve as nodes for the Architect to appear at after teleporting out. Destroying all 4 is required to fight the Architect normally.
[[Heading:3]]Singularity Gate[[/Heading]]
A large and fragile machine on the left side of the map. If this machine is intact when the Architect is destroyed, a countdown of 10 turns will begin. If Cogmind is still on the map and the gate is not destroyed in that timeframe, Cogmind will be instantly destroyed. It is possible to activate the machine by performing the Gate Test 138-A and Gate Test 138-B hacks. This will an approximately 5 tile radius singularity that draws bots and parts in and destroys them instantly if the center is reached. This singularity will stop if the gate is destroyed. The Architect will intentionally target the gate to break it while in this state. The Gate Test 138-END will shut down the singularity. One additional hack, 138-C, requires the [[A2 Data Core]] which can be achieved by destroying A2. Performing this hack will immediately end the run and result in a [[Wintypes|W5 Wintype]]. If the singularity gate is still intact when the Architect is destroyed, the gate will be activated and can not be shut down by normal means. Cogmind must exit the map within 10 turns or destroy the singularity gate or else Cogmind will be instantly destroyed. If Cogmind exits the map while the countdown is going off, this will result a W6 wintype.
[[Heading:3]]Architect Logs[[/Heading]]
The Architect shell has 120 armor and is extremely difficult to break through by force. However, defeating the Architect will drop the [[Architect Data Core]] which will result in the shell retracting and revealing the inner Terminal that contains a large number of unique lore entries.
[[Heading:3]]Dimensional Slip Node[[/Heading]]
There is a Dimensional Slip node installed near the top of the map. Using a [[Transdimensional Reconstructor|regular]] or [[Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor]] will always go to this location. An exit is a few tiles away from this spot. If the Architect is still alive when Cogmind appears here, the log message [[GameText]]I have more important things to do than play hide-and-seek. Deal with this piece of junk if it returns.[[/GameText]] will appear, and the Architect will disappear off of the map and will not return.

[[Heading:2]]Caches[[/Heading]]There are several types of caches in Access_0, although they all draw from the same pool of potential items. This pool contains all rating 6-9 [[Prototype Part|Prototype]] parts accessible normally in 0b10 in stockpiles. It does not include any unique parts such as items found in [[Testing]] shells. These Prototype parts will never be faulty.
[[Heading:2]]Alien Artifacts[[/Heading]]
There are typically multiple Alien Artifacts held in 40 armor Workstation machines. If there are any, one will be guaranteed to be a Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor. The full list of available Alien Artifacts are:
[[List]][[Core Expander]]|[[Core Regenerator]]|[[Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor]]|[[Integrated Dissipator]]|[[Integrated Mediator]]|[[Integrated Reactor]]|[[Integrity Redistributor]]|[[Sigix Broadsword]][[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]There is a single exit in Access_0. A [[Surface]] exit is buried behind several dozen tiles of earth near the top of the map. It can be accessed via the Dimensional Slip Node by using a regular or Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor or by digging deep into the earth.

[[Heading]]Special bots[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:2]]The [[Architect]][[/Heading]]
The Architect is the true final boss of Cogmind. It has a multitude of strong offensive and defensive parts, resistances to most common damage types, 400 core, innate core and part regeneration, perfect always-active tracking on Cogmind's position, and a whopping 28 speed to top it all off. There is also a unique mechanic where the Architect will teleport to a nearby Subspace Access Node under various conditions. This includes: falling to 80% of core integrity (320/400), losing 2/3 Modified Sigix Shearguns, or becoming overweight. It will always have [[Perfect Tracking]] on Cogmind and never give up pursuit. It also has ""Behemoth AI"", where it will try to shoot Cogmind through several layers of tiles. This can be exploited by moving behind walls where repeated shots will take out wall tiles instead of hitting Cogmind.
The Architect can not be destroyed by most methods unless all 4 of the subspace access nodes are destroyed first. The one exception to this rule is that dealing 400 core damage in a single turn can destroy the Architect. While technically possible with a large enough weapon volley, this method of killing is primarily reserved to a few unique weapons, like the [[BFG-9k Vortex Edition]], the [[L-Cannon]], a [[Sigix Exoskeleton]]-boosted [[Core Cannon]], or 2 Core Cannons.
[[Heading:3]]Special Weapon Interactions[[/Heading]]
There are a few weapons that have special interactions with the Architect.
[[Heading:4]][[Sigix Terminator]]/[[Supercharged Sigix Terminator]][[/Heading]]
Using either of these weapons will cause the Architect to wrap to the nearest subspace node, resulting in the log message [[GameText]]I'm all too familiar with what that does.[[/GameText]] This effect will only occur if one or more subspace nodes are intact. Due to the way the Architect teleports, it is possible to hit it with the explosion, but only if the pad that the Architect teleports to is within range. This can be used to take out the last pad and land a hit on the Architect at the same time.
[[Heading:4]][[L-Cannon]][[/Heading]]
Similar to the terminators, it is not possible to hit the Architect with the L-Cannon unless the subspace nodes are all destroyed. The log message [[GameText]]I'm aware you stole the capacitor, you know...[[/GameText]] will accompany the Architect teleporting to the nearest subspace node. Even if the nodes are taken down, destroying the singularity gate is required before using the L-Cannon for the killing blow. Otherwise Cogmind will be crushed in the 10 turn countdown since the weapon itself takes 10 turns of delay after firing.
[[Heading:3]]Self-destruct codes[[/Heading]]
If any Enhanced bots or A bots are assimilated by disruption and rewiring or via the [[Field Lobotomy Kit]] and the Architect spots them, a log message [[GameText]]Architect flashes a signal at [Bot Name].[[/GameText]] will appear, and the bot will self-destruct. Bots that self-destruct will drop loot normally according to their salvage. This usually results in some pretty large loot pile explosions, especially for some of the lower numbered A bots. Although these bots cannot be used as allies, assimilation is a good way to let the Architect get rid of them rather than fighting them yourself.
[[Heading:3]]Defeat[[/Heading]]
The Architect is a sore loser. If destroyed, the Singularity Gate will be activated (if intact) and trigger a 10 turn countdown. Cogmind must either use a Transdimensional Reconstructor and escape out the exit at the top of the map near the Slip Node or destroy the Gate machine within these 10 turns to avoid instant death.
[[Heading:2]][[A Bots]][[/Heading]]
The A bots are a series of very powerful and unique enemies, most of which only appearing in Access_0 or are allies on other maps. A8 appears at the entrance to the map and A2 guards the ""bridge"" to the left side of the map. [[A7]] does not appear on this map at all. Other than that, [[A6]], [[A5]], [[A4]], and [[A3]] all appear after Cogmind has explored a certain percentage of the map. They appear at roughly 10-15%, 25-30%, 45-50%, and 70-75% map exploration respectively. This is only affected by tiles seen by Cogmind and not other forms of intel such as drones or terrain scanning. If A8 was destroyed in [[Zion]], or A5 was in [[Lab]], they will not appear in Access_0. All A bots also maintain perfect tracking on Cogmind and can not be shaken.
[[Heading:2]][[Enhanced Programmer|Enhanced Programmers]][[/Heading]]
Enhanced Programmers are a unique type of bot that can show up in Access_0, but only under certain conditions. Using the [[Data Miner|Data Miner's]] [[Data Conduit]] or bringing more than 2 combat allies (bots with weapons) into the map will trigger these bots to spawn. They are extremely tough bots with many resistances and carry an [[Adv. Remote Force Field]] that will shield other allies. They will roam around the map as lone patrol bots.

[[Heading]]Unlockable Architect Logs[[/Heading]]
Similar to the Lab orders, there are some unique lore entries in the Architect Logs that can only be obtained by performing specific actions before that point. To read these logs, Cogmind must either defeat the Architect or have a strong enough weapon to break through the 120 armor shell that also doesn't break the frail Terminal inside it.
[[List]]Log L.L98W4A5V: Use the Data Miner's Data Conduit.
|Log L.MJH3MJHF: Save [[Revision 17]] in [[Cetus]] by defeating all of the [[Cetus Guard|Cetus Guards]]. Revision 17 must die before Cogmind exits the map.

"Achievements","Other","There are currently 256 achievements in Cogmind, which can be viewed in-game through the Achievements records submenu. They are divided into several categories organized by color, with the appearance of their borders sometimes providing additional information. 81 of the 256 Achievements have hidden descriptions that are only revealed after completing them.

Visually, Achievements are tile-based 5x5 squares. While an Achievement is locked, the inner 3x3 square is made out of question marks. Unlocking an Achievement changes the inner 3x3 square to visually represent the Achievement's requirements/results. The tiles on the border of the 5x5 square almost never change when the Achievement is unlocked. [[Comment]]Those achievements are ""Stardust"" and ""Planet Killer"". this is because Wins Achievements' inner art isn't a square but more of a cog, so some of the outer border tiles are part of said art, even if it's just a matching background. This dark green background is the same for all Wins Achievements, except those two. The locked versions, however, still have that dark green background.[[/Comment]]

After a certain number of hostile bots are detected using the Active Sensor, an [[Investigation Squad]] will be dispatched to Cogmind's location. This accompanied by an alert [[GameText]]ALERT: Active scanning activity reported from Zone [zone], dispatching Investigation squad[[/GameText]]. The number of bots needed to be scanned varies by the type of bot that has been detected. Once the total detection % reaches 100%, an investigation is summoned, Cogmind's [[Alert]] goes up by 100, and the detection % is reset to 0. Bots not listed in the below table don't count toward an active scanning penalty.

"Alarm Trap","Other","Alarm Traps are the only [[Traps]] that can appear in all [[0b10]] maps that can contain 0b10 traps. Like [[Ambush Trap|Ambush Traps]] and [[Chute Trap|Chute Traps]], they cannot be extracted using a [[Trap Extractors|Trap Extractor]].

[[Heading]]Effects[[/Heading]]
When an Alarm Trap is triggered, it and all other Alarm Traps in the array will be spent, a special alert sound will play, accompanied by the alert message [[GameText]]ALERT: Alarm triggered, dispatching investigation squad[[/GameText]]. This will cause an [[Investigation Squad]] to be dispatched to the location of the Alarm Trap, and nearby combat bots will be informed of the victim's position. If an Alarm Trap is triggered far enough from Cogmind, there will be no alert sound or message, but an investigation squad will still be dispatched. 
In [[Garrison|Garrisons]], triggering an Alarm Trap does not play an alert sound, do not trigger an alert message and instead only the log message [[GameText]]An alarm sounds[[/GameText]], no investigation squad is dispatched, and instead the only effect is that nearby combat bots will be informed of the victim's position.

[[Heading]]Alarm Trap-Specific removal strategies[[/Heading]]
Like Ambush Traps, successfully hacking Alarm Traps using a [[Melee Datajacks|Melee Datajack]] will always disable them, never reprogram them. It still possible to reprogram Alarm Traps through [[Terminal]] hacking, though this is not recommended as this will cause any hostiles that move onto the traps to trigger them, which will still dispatch an investigation squad.
If Cogmind has a [[Transmission Jammers|Transmission Jammer]] or [[Spoiler]]the Signal Jamming [[RIF]] ability[[/Spoiler]] and an Alarm Trap is triggered within jamming range, the trap array will still be spent, but will have no effect and grant the ""No Signal"" [[Mechanics Achievements|Mechanics Achievement]] if it wasn't already unlocked. [[Allies]] are incapable of using a Signal Jammer even when they have one attached, so do not rely on them to jam Alarm Traps.

In Garrisons, if there are no combat bots nearby, for example if they have already been dealt with, Alarm Traps will have no meaningful effect.

"Alert","Other","Alert is an underlying mechanic throughout the game that describes Cogmind's apparent threat level to [[0b10]]. It only comes into play in 0b10-controlled maps, primarily on main floors like [[Materials]] or [[Factory]] or a few 0b10 branches. It can be increased by many ways, most often by getting spotted or destroying bots or parts of the level. Alert does naturally dissipate over time, although combat-oriented strategies will almost always generate much more alert than the dissipation rate.
Alert is normally hidden throughout the game, although it can be revealed through a few different ways. [[RIF]]-alignment gives a permanent influence number and alert level indicator on the UI at all times. The [[0b10 Alert Chip]] gives the same indication when equipped. Additionally, alert level can be checked by using the [[GameText]]check_alert[[/GameText]] hack when using a [[Datajacks|Datajack]] on an [[Operator]], or by using the [[GameText]]Alert(Check)[[/GameText]] hack at a [[Terminal]].
There are 2 aspects of the Alert level. The first is the ""influence"" number, which is the numeric representation of alert. This can only be seen when using RIF or the Alert Chip. The other, the alert level, is an approximation of the influence. Low security is the lowest level of alert when the influence number is less than 200 and does not have any additional information. However, alert levels 1 through 4 are all divided into 26 alphabetical subsections. For example, alert level 1 begins at 200 and ends at 399 influence. Checking the alert level while at 200 influence will report ""1-A"", and checking at 399 will report ""1-Z"". This can be used to approximate the influence number, although the exact number does not really matter.

[[Heading]]Alert levels[[/Heading]]
[[Table]]
Alert level|Minimum Value|Maximum Value||
Low Security|0|199||
1|200|399||
2|400|699||
3|700|1199||
4|1200|1599||
5|1600|No Max
[[/Table]]
Alert level controls only a few aspects of the game: [[Assault Squad|Assaults]], [[Patrol Squad|Searches]], and [[High Security]]. Alert level does not increase the number of patrols or guards on the map in any way. Alert below level 2 does not have any impact on the game. At alert level 2/400 influence, Assaults and [[Search Patrol|Search Patrols]] can start being dispatched. From this point onward, alert is a sliding scale. Increased alert will also increase the overall frequency of Assaults and the number of [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]] that will be dispatched as part of an Assault. Alert level 2 typically only sends a single ARC per Assault wave, but higher alert levels can see two or more being sent frequently.
[[High Security]] is the other affect of alert. It is a special alert level that can only be triggered when at level 5 alert when combat hostiles are destroyed. The higher the influence value, the higher the chance of triggering High Security. [[Maximum Security]] has similar effects as High Security, but is not related to alert except that it sets influence to 1600 if it is lower than that.

[[/Table]]
[[List:Ordered]]Successful hacking increases alert more if the hack is less likely to succeed. Alert does not increase at all from hacks with a success rate of >= 30%.[[/List]]
There are also modifiers that can affect how much alert is gained by a certain percentage. The 0b10 Alert Chip reduces all influence gains by 20%, and the RIF ability Threat Obfuscation reduces all gains by 25%, 40%, or 50% depending on level. All alert reduction is rounded down, and reduction will not take place unless the value is at least 1. For example, gaining 3 influence from destroying a wall on -2 with the Alert Chip equipped results in 0.6 reduction which rounds down to 0. With this 20% reduction, only influence gains of 5 or more will have any reduction applied. On the other hand, having blue or purple allies within a 20-tile radius will increase alert gain from destroying bots. The gain is roughly 12.5% per ally, capping out at an additional 100% alert gain at 8 nearby allies. This effect can be cancelled out by the RIF ability Alert ID Control. In general, be cautious of taking large groups of allies into combat or else alert can quite easily skyrocket.

[[Heading]]Ways to lower alert[[/Heading]]
Lowering alert tends to be quite a bit more difficult than gaining it in the first place for most builds. The best way to dissipate large amounts of alert is to exit the map, as a large percentage of current alert is taken away immediately. Going into [[Caves]] in [[Factory]] branches is even better. By the end of several Caves maps, alert will most likely have dropped down to 0. This alert reduction effect lessens the higher up Cogmind is in the complex, and the amount varies depending on whether Cogmind is exiting into a branch map or a new main depth. Some maps always have fixed alert reduction percentages regardless of floor.
[[Heading:2]]Exit alert influence reduction[[/Heading]]

[[/Table]]
[[Heading:2]]Passive alert reduction[[/Heading]]
The most substantial alert reduction method aside from exiting the map is a passive alert reduction over time. Every 20 turns, influence will decrease by a slowly diminishing value.
[[Table]]
Turn range|Alert Influence reduction per 20 turns|Total cumulative reduction over range||
20-380|10|190||
400-780|8|350||

2000-2780|2|690||
2800-4380|1|770
[[/Table]]
[[Heading:2]]Other alert influence reduction[[/Heading]]
There are a few other miscellaneous ways of decreasing alert:
[[Table]]
Method|Alert influence reduction||
Cogmind part destroyed by combat hostile|10||
Non-combat ally destroyed by combat hostile|10||
Combat ally destroyed by combat hostile|20||
Alert(Purge) [[Terminal]] hack|150||

[[/Table]]
[[List:Ordered]]Each purge_threat hack reduces the amount of influence reduced by 25 until the minimum value of 50 is reached. So purging will reduce by 150, 125, 100, 75, and remain at 50. This number resets back to 150 with each new map.[[/List]]","","","","","","",""

"Alignment","Other","Alignments are a major part of Cogmind's journey each run. They can provide unique capabilities or trigger certain events, but often lock other pieces of content out as inaccessible. Some factions change large aspects of Cogmind's normal interaction with the game world, while others only trigger a specific event in the game. Some can provide unique [[Wintypes]]. Selecting factions wisely is an important part of a run.

[[Heading]]List of alignments[[/Heading]]
[[List]][[Core Reset Matrix]] (CRM), [[Sigix]] alignment: The CRM is a lategame consumable [[Alien Artifacts|Alien Artifact]] that provides a variety of unique abilities, with the most substantial benefit being the instant detection of all other Alien Artifacts upon consumption or entering a new map. The major downside is a memory wipe that removes most of Cogmind's knowledge. Consuming it also angers a few other factions and locks out certain events.|[[FarCom]], [[Exiles (Group)|Exiles]] alignment: An early game alignment that provides a permanent 18-tile radius combat bot sensor in all [[0b10]]-controlled floors as well as 1 type of unique Exile prototype. Its major downsides are locking out Imprint and a harsh penalty when entering [[Research]] branches; [[Testing]] and [[Quarantine]] become quite difficult, and [[Section 7]] and [[Protoforge]] are locked out entirely.|[[Imprint]], [[Zion]] alignment: A midgame alignment that dramatically changes [[Terminal]] hacking. All standard Terminal hacks are removed and replaced with special random Zion ally summons and intel. Imprint is a powerful but tricky alignment to use due to the loss of standard Terminal hacking. Imprinting also locks Cogmind out of gaining the aid of several other Derelict factions.|[[Redacted]][[MAIN.C]] surrender - 0b10 alignment: This lategame alignment only becomes available in [[Command]] after defeating the [[MAIN.C (Shell)|MAIN.C Shell]] and enables a particular win, w8 by fighting off waves of [[Enhanced Q-Series]]. Surrendering to MAIN.C locks Cogmind out of several ending types, as well as the ability to enter [[Access_0]].[[/Redacted]]|[[Relay Interface Framework]] (RIF), 0b10 alignment: An alignment available as early as [[Materials]], RIF allows for much greater control of 0b10 complex bots through the use of special hacks via [[Relay Couplers]]. RIF also provides many unique abilities that make traversing the complex safer or easier. The major downside of RIF is that several [[Derelict]] factions will be unable to identify Cogmind as friendly and will instead turn hostile.|[[Revision 17 (Alignment)|Revision 17 Alignment]]: [[Revision 17]] is a quite unique Derelict that can be rescued in [[Cetus]]. Revision 17's role is not a large one, but its -3 Research invasion can stir up some trouble and hopefully provide some aid in Research.|[[Redacted]][[Sigix Exoskeleton]], Sigix alignment: The Sigix Exoskeleton is an immensely powerful and gamechanging build type available late in the game in Section 7. It provides Cogmind with lots of firepower, a massive amount of map intel, and fast and high integrity and coverage exoskeleton part. The downsides to the Exoskeleton are reduced slot count (down to 1-3-3-2 initially), a decently low maximum support, and the full weight of 0b10's [[Maximum Security]] sent after Cogmind whenever spotted. This item is very powerful, but drastically changes gameplay for the rest of the run compared to most other alignments.[[/Redacted]]|[[UFD|United Federation of Derelicts]] alignment: The UFD is a Derelict group whose home is in the 0b1 Old Recycling map [[Scraptown]]. Their major benefits include some unique parts available on the map and their ability to summon [[Scrapoid|Scrapoids]] and [[Scraphulk|Scraphulks]] from [[Recycling Unit|Recycling Units]]. They also have a unique lategame event and wintype where [[Redacted]]they begin an assault on the lategame map [[Protoforge]].[[/Redacted]]|[[Warlord (Alignment)|Warlord Alignment]]: [[Warlord]] is a unique and much beloved Derelict that wages war on 0b10 whose help can be obtained in the midgame. His -2 Research assault is similar to Revision 17's but on a much grander scale. Lots of loot can be found wherever Warlord goes. He can also make an appearance in the [[Redacted]][[Command]] cave seals[[/Redacted]], which can even lead to a unique wintype. The [[Encrypted Comm Array]] also falls under this alignment and turns destruction of 0b10 [[Garrison|Garrisons]] and [[DSF|DSFs]] into more powerful Warlord forces.|[[Zhirov (Alignment)|Zhirov Alignment]]: [[Zhirov]] is another unique Derelict who can provide a big help in the lategame. Grabbing the [[SGEMP Prototype]] in Testing provides a few temporary allies (including Zhirov himself) and full map intel of [[Access]], a notoriously difficult map. His quest can continue on in [[Redacted]]Command, where his Modified SGEMP can disable the whole map's worth of 0b10 bots when the MAIN.C Shell is defeated.[[/Redacted]][[/List]]

[[Heading]]Benefits[[/Heading]]
[[Operator]] class robots will give you a diminishing hacking bonus starting at +10% (10%, 5%, 2%, 1%..), and will reveal any hidden door or trap, provided the operator is within 20 tiles range of you. Operators will also report changes in security level.
[[Mechanic]] class robots when set to [[GameText]]AID[[/GameText]] will repair core integrity [[B]](but NOT for Cogmind)[[/B]], broken parts, non-functional parts, and part integrity of their repair target (Cogmind is prioritized over allies) in that order. Mechanics cannot repair a part above 50% integrity.
[[Protector]] class robots shield nearby allies including Cogmind and potentially help with intercepting remote datajacks and launcher projectiles.
[[Programmer]] class robots can cleanse corruption from allies and hack hostile bots.
[[Recycler]] and [[Hauler]] class robots can pick up and store items for cogmind. Note that there is no warning message for crushing parts when dropping items.
[[T-07 Excavator]] bots can dig for cogmind using the Tunnel command. Unlike the related [[RIF]] hack, this does not guarantee the tile will be stable. ","","","","","","",""

"Ambush Trap","Other","Ambush Traps are [[Traps]] that can appear in various [[0b10]] maps. Like [[Alarm Trap|Alarm Traps]] and [[Chute Trap|Chute Traps]], they cannot be extracted using a [[Trap Extractors|Trap Extractor]]. Some of the maps that Ambush Traps cannot appear in are [[Materials]] maps and [[Garrison|Garrisons]].
[[Comment]]
This table is within a comment, which prevents it from appearing.
Ideally, once the table is eventually filled out, the comment tags (and this explanation) will be removed.
-Mines can contain 0b10 traps, either because of the trapped ""shop"" or because of a Derelict placing traps, and can also contain stashes of uninstalled traps (not sure if those should be counted? For other 0b10 Trap pages, i mean.)
-(Proximity Caves are a special case, as exactly one prefab can have 0b10 traps in it. There is no reason to mention other non-0b10 maps)
If the answer is the same for all research branches, perhaps they could be grouped together as ""research branches"" to avoid naming them? Speaking of, i know Ambush Traps used to exist in at least some research branches, but there was a fix to prevent friendly derelicts from emerging from them there, as accidental allies can cause too much chaos due to researchers, and i don't know if that fix just prevented friendly derelicts from appearing there, or removed ambush traps in those branches altogether.

List of all maps that can contain 0b10 traps and whether they can contain Ambush Traps:

[[Heading]]Effects[[/Heading]]
When an Ambush Trap is triggered, it and all other Ambush Traps in the array will be spent, and up three 0b10 combat bots will emerge from some of the Traps. Each Ambush Trap can only reveal a single 0b10 combat bot, either a [[Swarmer]], a [[Grunt]], a [[Duelist]] or a [[Brawler]], so if there are only one or two Ambush Traps left in the array, fewer than three bots will appear. The Ambush Trap that was triggered will always spawn a bot. If there is currently a bot on an Ambush Trap that spawns a combat bot, that combat bot will appear on the side of the Trap instead. Unless the Traps were triggered manually, the bots will take their turn immediately, which can be particularly dangerous if some of them are Brawlers and appear next to Cogmind. However, if any of the bots that appear are Duelists or Brawlers, then, out of all the Ambush Traps that do reveal bots, they will always be appear from the farthest ones from Cogmind. For example, in a horizontal row of 6 contiguous Ambush Traps, if Cogmind triggers the one farthest west, then it and two of the other Traps, chosen at random, will all reveal bots. If one of those bots is a Brawler, then out of the three Traps, it will emerge from the one farthest from Cogmind.

On some rare occasions, Ambush Traps will have been infiltrated by friendly [[Thug|Thugs]]. This cannot happen in [[Research]] branches. Up to three Thugs can appear, the only possible limitation being the number of functional Ambush Traps in the array when a Trap is triggered. [[Spoiler]]The [[Encrypted Comm Array]] is capable of detecting nearby Derelict-infiltrated Ambush Traps, even from inventory.[[/Spoiler]]
On rarer occasions, Ambush Traps may have been infested by [[Assembled]], in which case the Ambush Trap that was triggered will remain and three Assembled will emerge from it immediately, while the other Ambush Traps in the array will be spent and up to three broken 0b10 combat bots will emerge from them. A [[Demolisher Squad]] will be dispatched, and Assembled will keep emerging from the Ambush Trap that was triggered until it is destroyed by an explosion. [[Comment]]Can it be destroyed by something else? Are there multiple types of Assembled Ambush Trap infestations? I *think* i remember a type where far more than three had emerged at the same time, but it's been a while. Lastly, will more Demolisher squads be dispatched if the trap isn't destroyed early enough? I think so, but i'm not sure.[[/Comment]]

Like Alarm Traps, successfully hacking Ambush Traps using a [[Melee Datajacks|Melee Datajack]] will always disable them, never reprogram them. It still possible to reprogram Alarm Traps through [[Terminal]] hacking, though this is not recommended as this will cause any hostiles that move onto the traps to trigger them, which will still cause the robots below to emerge and roam the map.

Any part with high coverage and integrity can act like armor. Parts often used for this include [[Treads]] and [[Ballistic Cannons]]. The difference is that dedicated ""armor"" parts have little other purpose than their protective role, whereas losing a tread or a cannon can disable critical aspects of a build.

"Armory","Location","Armory is a [[0b10]]-controlled [[Factory]]/[[Research]] [[Branch]] that appears between -4 and -3. It is a tough map with tight corridors, few available paths, an above average number of patrols, and special dormant and guard bots. There are several unique types of patrols on this map as well, with a [[Demolisher]] leading a squad of [[Grunt|Grunts]] and [[Duelist]] squads with a [[Protector]] in tow. Stealth builds will have a difficult time of sneaking past unnoticed and combat hostiles must be ready to do a lot of killing to get by. If Cogmind can survive, some of the rewards are rewirable allies, a high number of [[Fabricator|Fabricators]], and large stockpiles of out-of-depth parts.
The overall map structure varies, but there are some common features of Armory maps. There are usually corridors running horizontally on the bottom and top of the map that contain large rooms next to each other connected by Emergency Access doors. The map can be a little maze-like although heading to the left and crossing from bottom to top or top to bottom will usually lead to an exit.
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
There is one type of special machine in Armory. The Energy Cycler is a large explosive machine that will open all Sealed Heavy Doors on the map and summon several patrols. These Sealed Heavy Doors have hackable Terminals and contain high rating part stockpiles, sometimes full of entirely non-faulty [[Prototype Part|Prototype Parts]].

[[Heading:2]]Disassembled Obliterator[[/Heading]]
There is a special portion of Armory near the left side of the map. This area is heavily guarded by 2 pairs of 2 Armor Guards, with many [[Stasis Trap|Stasis Traps]] getting in the way of entry. It is sealed off by 50 armor Sealed Blast doors that can be opened with a 30% success rate Terminal. The inner area has an unavoidable special alarm that triggers when entered. The log message [[GameText]]Weapon containment breached. Dispatching heavy reinforcements to the area.[[/GameText]] will appear and 2 assault [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]] will be dispatched to the location. Additionally, many standard [[Alarm Trap|Alarm Traps]] are here. 2/4 of the inner Reinforced Shells will be filled. One will always have a PL-3XN's Ring and another will always have a Disassembled Obliterator.
[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There are 3 types of exits in Armory:
[[List]]Center main access: This exit is guarded by 4 [[Sentry|Sentries]] and appears in the center of the map. There are 2 tile wide corridors that extend in opposite directions coming from the exit.|Left main access: This exit is unguarded and is found behind a set of double doors on the left side of the map.|[[Lab]] exit: This exit is hidden behind a wall on the far-left side of the map. It will always be adjacent to a 1 tile wide hallway. [[Redacted]]There is a [[Dimensional Node Initializer]] installed at the exit to Lab. Using a [[Transdimensional Reconstructor]] or [[Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor]] will always cause Cogmind to end up next to this exit.[[/Redacted]][[/List]]

[[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]
[[VL-GR5]]: VL-GR5 can appear the entrance of Armory, challenging Cogmind to a competition. If Cogmind can get 15 kills before VL-GR5, they will hand over [[VL-GR5's Timing Chip]]. Watch out for misses and explosions, as hurting them too many times will cause them to attach a [[Multinova Projection Cannon]] and turn on Cogmind.

"Assault Squad","Other","Assault squads are [[0b10]] aligned [[Squad|squads]] that are sent after Cogmind as a result of having too high [[Alert]]. Assaults are sent to Cogmind's position when initially reported, and then they will roam around an expanding search area. They consist of a single [[C-30 ARC]] typically containing 5 bots inside. If Cogmind has 3 or more allies, up to 2 additional bots may be sent to escort the ARC as additional firepower. Assault squads can be both Enumerated and Recalled at [[Terminal|Terminals]].
An alert indicates whenever an Assault squad is dispatched. Additionally, the log will display a message like [[GameText]]ALERT: Significant disruption in zone 9B, assault force dispatched[[/GameText]]. If more than one ARC was sent, the message will instead indicate [[GameText]]multiple assault carriers dispatched[[/GameText]].

[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]
[[Lore]]WAR.Sys Records|Assault Squad[[/Lore]]

[[Heading]]Frequency and Number[[/Heading]]
Assaults may be dispatched regularly as long as Cogmind is at least Alert level 2 or 400 influence, although at lower Alert levels Assaults are rare. At Alert levels well above 1000, Assaults may be sent out at nearly opportunity. A higher Alert level also increases the chances of multiple ARCs being dispatched. In [[Materials]], Assaults can be dispatched every 400 turns on -9 and -8. In [[Factory]] and above, this changes to be every 250 turns. Most assault waves consists of 1-2 ARCs, but at Alert levels in excess of 5X/1600 influence, 3 or even more ARCs can be sent.
[[Heading:2]]During [[High Security|High]] or [[Maximum Security]][[/Heading]]
The frequency, number, and contents of ARCs changes. Assault forces with stronger compositions than usual may be dispatched in these conditions, although these ARCs only have 4 bots inside rather than the typical 5. 4 ARCs will be dispatched 100 turns into High Security and after another 100 turns. After that, 2 more ARCs will be added to each wave, but 50 more turns will be added in between the dispatch of each wave. The sizes of the Assault waves will also start to increase each wave, and the duration between each wave will increase. Maximum Security is similar, but with 6 ARCs to start the first 2 waves. The 2nd wave of Assaults in High Security and all subsequent waves, and all waves of Maximum Security may contain stronger than usual bots in them.

[[Heading]]Assault Contents[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Assault Contents.png|Example contents of an Assault squad ARC[[/Image]]
Assault contents can vary by depth, but their makeups are always similar. Assaults will always contain 4 combat bots and 1 support-type bot. The combat bots may become stronger under heavy assault conditions, but the possible support bots are always the same.

Redirection can only occur when High/Maximum Security is not active. If a redirect happens, the alert [[GameText]]Higher priority target acquired, redirecting assault.[[/GameText]] will be displayed. If an Assault is not redirected, there is a further 50% chance that the contents may be redirected after the ARC opens up. This can happen within 30 turns of the ARC opening.

"Behemoth","Bot Group","Behemoths are a [[Bot Groups|Bot Group]] of heavily [[Armor|armored]] [[Treads|treading]] [[0b10]] bots that are much more durable and powerful than the majority of standard bots. They typically guard machines or valuable part stockpiles while sitting slightly indented in the wall. Similar to [[Hunter|Hunters]], Behemoths will fire through walls in order to hit an enemy, which makes it hard to hide or run from them. Behemoths can even make use of [[Special Propulsion Modes#Siege mode|Siege Mode]] to become more accurate and durable in combat. This combination of traits can make Behemoths terrifying encounters if not adequately prepared.
Behemoths have innate EM resistance as well as corruption resistance through [[Dynamic Insulation System|Dynamic Insulation Systems]], so EM weaponry is a subpar weapon choice to get a quick kill. Melee weapons are undesirable to use because most Behemoths pack [[Ballistic Cannons]] that will frequently cause knockback. Behemoths have a minor thermal weakness, though that is slightly mitigated by thermal [[Resistance Armor]]. Meltdown criticals from thermal cannons can instantly destroy a Behemoth from full core integrity (100+), which can save a lot of damage and provide some good undamaged loot. Thermal guns are not effective in smaller numbers, but given enough heat transferring weapons (4+) it is possible to overload their standard cooling and [[Coolant Injectors]] to get the melt instant kill.
Behemoths can be a desirable looting target for their weapons, cooling, treads, and armor. For this reason, applying some positive salvage via Electromagnetic weaponry or [[Salvage Targeting Computers]] can be a good idea. However, it can often be a better idea to run the other way. Even slow treads builds can get away from a pursuing Behemoth with good tactics. Despite their ability to tear through walls in their way, they have a tendency to get stuck unable to path through 1 tile wide corridors. If such corridors are nearby, use them to your advantage. Otherwise, try to cut between connected rooms to avoid traveling through so much of the line of fire. Behemoths will only shoot through up to 3 walls to cut a path, so if Cogmind can turn a corner or get a good angle on the Behemoth where it is unable to shoot, it is possible to wait out the memory.
Behemoths are often found in their own spot inside a wall as a [[Security Squad]]. In [[Caves]], they can be found in a small square open area.

[[Image]]Cargo Convoy Deployed.png|A cargo convoy with ARCs deployed[[/Image]]
Cargo convoys are a special form of [[Transport Squad|transport squads]] that can be found from -7 to -2 on main [[Factory]] and [[Research]] floors. They consist of a single [[A-27 Freighter]], a [[Protector]], and two [[C-30 ARC|C-30 ARCs]] full of 4 combat bots and an extra utility bot, similar to strong [[Assault Squad|assaults]]. The parts contained within a Freighter are all [[Prototype Part|prototype]] or [[Authchips]], never faulty, and can be up to 3 ratings out of depth. For example, on -7, regular Haulers can contain up to rating 4 prototype parts. A cargo convoy Freighter can carry rating 5-7 prototype parts.
Cargo convoys are always preceded by 3-5 [[Swarmer|Swarmers]] that scout out the path of the convoy before it appears. The alert [[GameText]]Cargo convoy en route, clear transfer corridor.[[/GameText]] will indicate when this is happening. A few turns later, the Freighter and guards will appear and take the same route.
Cargo convoys will always appear at a 0b10 controlled exit and head to a [[Garrison Access|Garrison]]. Typically the Freighter leads the way and stays ahead of the Protector and ARCs, which normally trail a few tiles behind. A [[Transport Network Coupler]] or [[Modified TNC]] will reveal the planned path of the Freighter. The Modified TNC will also show the contents of the Freighter. The Manifests hack will also show all the parts contained by the Freighter.

[[Heading]]Unique parts[[/Heading]]
There are 2 fully unique Cargo Convoy drops as well as one semi-unique drop:

If a cargo convoy is attacked, a message will indicate this, as well as an alert: [[GameText]]ALERT: Cargo convoy interrupted, initiating access lockdown.[[/GameText]] 100 turns after this, a [[Heavy]] will spawn at an 0b10 controlled exit or Garrison every 100 turns until all exits are guarded by a Heavy. Heavies may head toward a far away [[Caves]] exit in order to guard it. The Freighter will begin running away in a random direction when attacked. If it is not destroyed, it will head toward another nearby 0b10 controlled exit.

[[Heading]][[Derelict]] attack[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Cargo Convoy Attack.png|Derelicts from a Garrison ready to assault a convoy[[/Image]]
There is a chance that Derelicts will decide to attack a cargo convoy. The chance is higher at lower depths. If they attack, they will appropriate a Garrison machine, rig some [[Dirty Bomb Trap|Dirty Bomb Traps]], and attack the convoy guards. If they are successful, they will retreat and leave the loot available for Cogmind. This may happen even if Cogmind is nowhere near the convoy. It may be a good idea to track the Freighter position in case this happens, even if not planning to attack the convoy directly, since this can often result in lots of powerful free loot. If Cogmind is not close enough to grab the loot, [[Recycler|Recyclers]] may have carried it off to a nearby [[Recycling Unit]]. Make sure to check these if the Freighter's stash can't be found nearby.

"Cave-ins","Other","Cave-ins are a [[Game Mechanics|Game Mechanic]] where dug-out tiles will collapse and instantly deal a large amount of Impact damage to anything on the tile. It is safe to dig up to 3 tiles or even 4 tiles safely in some circumstances, but long distance digging is almost always unsafe.
For the purposes of this article, ""stable tile"" means regular tiles which can't ever cave-in, ""dug-out tile"" means tiles that used to be Walls or Earth tiles, were destroyed and now glow red, and ""unstable/destabilized tile"" means a dug-out tile that was destabilized in some way.

[[Heading]]Causes of cave-ins[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Destabilized Tiles.png|Destabilized tiles are bright red as shown by a Structural Scanner[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]]Destabilization[[/Heading]]
Destabilized tiles are tiles that will always collapse if given enough time. They may collapse instantly or they may last a hundred turns or more. Destabilized tiles can be viewed with a [[Structural Scanner]]. A tile can become destabilized in two ways:
[[List]]Explosive damage - Explosive damage (namely from [[Launchers]]) is likely to cause tiles to become destabilized. Note that most, if not all Thermal and EM explosions do not have this effect.[[Comment]]I didn't test all of them, but i'd be surprised if that wasn't a damage type thing. I have not checked Kinetic, Special, or Entropic explosions, or Blasthammer directional, but if none of those are capable of destabilizing tiles, then EX damage should be noted as the only explosion damage type capable of destabilizing tiles, instead of mentioning all other types.[[/Comment]][[Comment]]Also, i'm not sure, but i think whether tiles get destabilized or not might be a chance dependent on the amount of damage that tile receives?[[/Comment]]
|Attacking from a dug out tile - If Cogmind or any other bot fires a weapon inside of a dug out tile, the tile will destabilize. This tile may collapse instantly before Cogmind gets a chance to move, so digging from inside these tiles is never completely safe.
In terms of destabilization, melee attacks are the least likely to collapse right away. Guns have a slightly higher chance, and then cannons and launchers have the highest chance.[[/List]]

[[Heading:2]]Dug-out tile traversal[[/Heading]]
It is possible to safely travel through dug-out tiles (that are not destabilized) for up to 1-4 tiles, depending on the type of tiles traversed. If the warnOnCaveinMove option in the advanced.cfg file is set to 1, the game will warn you when trying to move onto a dug-out tile that could collapse due to that movement. The safety of digs is follow (assuming the relevant tiles are not destabilized):
[[List]]
1-tile digs - Always safe.
|2-tile digs - Safe, unless both tiles are dug-out earth tiles (rarely relevant).
|3-tile digs - Safe, but only if no more than one of the tiles is a dug-out Earth tile.
For example, the most common safe 3-tile dig is Wall-Earth-Wall,
whereas Wall-Earth-Earth or Earth-Earth-Wall would not be safe and could collapse on the third and second tiles respectively due to having traveled through more than one earth tile. 
|4-tile digs - Only safe if all four tiles are dug-out Wall tiles. 4-tile digs are only rarely useful, usually to move barely out of visual range of a Heavy or Sentry.
|5-tile or more digs - Never safe.[[/List]]
One way to think about it is to consider that moving through a dug-out tile has a ""cost"", 2 for Wall tiles and 5 for Earth tiles, and that having reached a ""cost"" of 10 or more during a single dig can cause a cave-in on the current tile. [[Comment]]I feel like there's a better way to word this sentence.[[/Comment]]

Each step into an unsafe tile has a 10% chance of instantly causing a collapse of the tile moved into.


[[Heading:2]]Closed-off Tunnels[[/Heading]]
If a bot sits in a closed off area of the map, there is a chance each turn that a cave-in will occur. As long as there is a path to the main area of the map, it is safe to sit indefinitely in a dug out area. However, if the path closes due to something like an [[U-05 Engineer|Engineer]] rebuilding a wall, it will suddenly become dangerous.

[[Heading]]Example digs[[/Heading]]

[[Heading]]Avoiding cave-ins[[/Heading]]
Here are some strategies to avoid cave-ins:
[[List]]Don't use melee attacks to dig more than 1 tile - Melee weapons need to be adjacent to the next tile to dig out. This means Cogmind will have to be in a dug out tile to dig two consecutive tiles which allows a chance for an immediate destabilization cave-in.
|Don't use Explosive Launchers to dig - While Explosive Launchers can dig out a lot of tiles at once, many of those tiles have a chance to collapse as Cogmind walks through. It is safe to do this with a Structural Scanner equipped, as destabilized tiles will be visible and are avoidable.
|Use Thermal or Kinetic cannons - These cannons have a high base damage that is typically strong enough to dig through most non-reinforced walls. It is safe to dig a 3 tile path ahead of time and then walk through at no risk of cave-in.
|Be wary of [[U-05 Engineer|Engineers]] - Engineers may seal off your path and leave you stuck in the wall, forced to dig again to escape and risk immediate cave-in.[[/List]]

[[Heading:3]]Stable Digging[[/Heading]]
There are a few ways to dig out tiles in ways that cause the resulting tile to be stable, but all of them are very limited. They include:
[[List]]Most wall-opening/destroying events, such as opening the [[Exiles (Location)]] Vault or the [[Wastes]] Derelict incursion event. Note that if those tiles are dug out in any other way, they will act like regular dug-out tiles instead of stable tiles, even after the related event is triggered.
|Behemoths, when breaking walls through movement. However those tiles will only temporarily stay stable.
|Earth tiles that would normally be dug out by [[T-07 Excavator|T-07 Excavators]], such as many of those in Scrapyard.
|Certain prefab-specific Earth tiles that can be dug out to create stable tiles, such as a few of those in [[Subcaves]].
|[[Spoiler]]The [[GameText]]randomize_corridors[[/GameText]] [[RIF]] hack, which causes a T-07 Excavator to start randomly creating fully stable corridors.[[/Spoiler]]
|[[Spoiler]]The [[Vortex Shredder]] wielded exclusively by [[Borebot|Borebots]], which causes any tiles destroyed this way to be stable. Tiles that were already dug out in other ways will not become stable.[[/Spoiler]]
[[/List]]

[[Heading]]Non-standard Movement[[/Heading]]
Because only standard movements count towards the safety limit when traversing dug-out tiles, non-standard movement types can be used to bypass the safe dig limit, usually at the cost of some kind of damage, which may be preferable to the chance of high Impact damage from cave-ins. Some non-standard movements include:
[[List]]Being pushed into a dug-out tile by a friendly [[Behemoth]].
|Being knocked back by [[Ballistic Cannons|Ballistic Cannon]] projectile, usually from hostiles.
|Being knocked back by [[Concussive RPG]], including any used by Cogmind. Note that the explosion may cause dug-out tiles to become destabilized. [[Comment]]Since using one that way would push you away from the tile you fired from, i think that would make you immune to collapse due to attacking from a dug-out tile, but i haven't done thorough testing.[[/Comment]]
|Being knocked back by hostile [[Impact Weapons]], which would hardly be beneficial since it would mean taking Impact damage to avoid the possible Impact damage of a cave-in.
|[[Flight Units|Flying]] over robots, but only if that would move Cogmind onto a stable tile. Attempting to fly over robots onto a dug-tile will result in an ""invalid move"" message.
[[/List]]

[[Comment]]Some late-game AAs can make it possible to dig more safely/farther/better, they should probably be mentioned here? I'm not sure myself on how they function in regards to cave-ins due to movement.[[/Comment]]

","","","","","","",""
"Caves","Location","Caves is the most frequent [[Branch]] map throughout all of [[Factory]] depths. It is a non-[[0b10]]-controlled map where [[Derelict|Derelicts]] often roam free and hostile 0b10 squads patrol and can be taken out without fear of reinforcements. Non-patrolling 0b10 outposts guarded by a [[Sentry]] and dormant bots are common. Every depth has 2 guaranteed Caves exits and each Caves map is a part of a series of 3 maps in a row. Not counting event-based exits, all first Caves maps of each depth can only be exited by entering the second Caves map. Caves maps do not have very many regular parts on the ground, but piles of [[Scrap]] contain usable but partially damaged parts and [[Derelict Log|Derelict Logs]] can give unique intel about upcoming floors.
There are different names for the different types of Caves maps and they have slightly different characteristics. Lower Caves is the name given to the first 2 Caves maps on -7 and -6, while Caves maps on -5 and -4 are named Upper Caves. The third caves map is accessible only by exiting the depth-specific special branch at the left side of the second caves map and is called Proximity Caves, regardless of depth. Lower and Upper Caves are very similar in all but [[Robot Tier]], but Proximity Caves tends to be more densely populated with patrols, in addition to potentially having higher-tier robot variants due being one depth above the Caves that lead to them. They also contain [[N-01 Spotter|Spotters]] that will report armed hostiles on sight, causing a 150 alert increase per spot when entering the next map. This caps at 900 alert gained.
Caves are patrolled lightly by hostile 0b10 bots compared to the main floors. [[Infowar]] utilities are a good option to avoid unnecessary encounters as many patrols can be avoided with a bit of patience. Caves have a unique mechanic where parts dropped from 0b10 bots will automatically self-destruct after a few turns. Looting must be done quickly or else the dropped parts will be lost forever. The only 2 ways around this mechanic are [[Self-destruct Interrupter|Self-destruct Interrupters]] and [[Electromagnetic Weapons]]. The interrupters will prevent the parts from frying while active and EM damage will interfere with the self-destruct mechanism. While EM will give [[Corrupted Parts]], it is far better to end up with corrupted parts than to end up with no parts at all.
Due to the low rate of good parts spawning on the floor and the overall difficulty in looting hostile 0b10 bots, it is very easy for an unprepared build to fall apart in these maps. Bringing plenty of spares into Caves is highly recommended to avoid running out of essentials like propulsion, weapons, and armor. [[Launchers]] are a must here to handle ambushes of large numbers of 0b10 bots hiding in outposts. Launchers are also incredibly useful when entering a Caves map because the standard spawn protection that is present in 0b10 maps doesn't apply here. That means that one (or more) patrols can appear right in Cogmind's face on entering a map.
Caves are also the most common place to encounter the [[Decomposer|Decomposers]], [[Packrat|Packrats]] and [[Samaritan|Samaritans]] neutral Derelict bot classes. They tend to appear in single-class groups of three. Decomposers will collect all stray debris, parts, Scrap piles and [[Derelict Log|Derelict Logs]] they happen to find and will break them down into matter they then leave on the floor, potentially destroying valuable parts or intel. In some cases, the matter yielded this way may be useful, but in most cases destroying these bots as quickly as possible is highly recommended.
The 0b10 [[Minesweeper]] class can also be found in caves near Derelict [[Traps]], guarded by 0-2 [[Grunt|Grunts]]. If destroyed, the Traps they extracted will be dropped and won't self-destruct, and can be re-used to deal with 0b10 patrols or plan attacks on outposts.

[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]

[[Heading]]Navigation[[/Heading]]
Cave maps all have a very similar overall layout. While the paths within the caves are unpredictable, these maps can typically be divided into 6 equal chunks. Top left, top middle, top right, bottom left, bottom middle, and bottom right. Cogmind will always spawn from the top right or bottom right chunks in Lower and Upper Caves or the top left or bottom left chunks in Proximity caves. One exit will always be in the chunk furthest from Cogmind. In the second Lower or Upper Caves map, the unique branch exit will be in that furthest chunk and the exit back to the main floor will always be on the same side. A good rule of thumb is that left is away from 0b10 while right is toward 0b10.

[[Heading:2]]Checkpoints[[/Heading]]
Caves checkpoints are square-shaped open spaces with a guard positioned at the center with possibly other robots stationed nearby.
There are three types of checkpoints:
[[Table]]
Central guard|Alignment|Square size|Possible additional guards|Formation||
[[Mutant]]|Friendly (Warlord)|7x7|0, 2 or 4 [[Thug|Thugs]], [[Butcher|Butchers]] or [[Savage|Savages]]|X, / or \\-shaped||
Sentry|Hostile (0b10)|7x7|[[Swarmer|Swarmers]], [[Grunt|Grunts]], [[Duelist|Duelists]] or [[Brawler|Brawlers]]|Chaotic||
[[Behemoth]]|Hostile (0b10)|6x6|None|N/A

[[Heading:2]]Outposts[[/Heading]]
Outposts make up the most common type of guarded structure found within Caves. There are a lot of types of outposts, differing in shape, size, guards, rewards and sometimes events. Although their walls are visually identical to regular cave walls, outpost structures are always fully disconnected from regular cave walls. While some are controlled by friendly Derelicts, most outposts are controlled by 0b10 bots (or rarely by hostile Derelicts). Most Caves map will have exactly one functional 0b10 outpost.
[[Transmission Jammer|Transmission Jammers]] are highly recommended to take bots in these hostile outposts out one at a time without getting overwhelmed. In some hostile encounters, [[Sentry|Sentries]] can call for a reinforcement [[Assault Squad]]. In the first Caves map each depth only no reinforcements will come as there is no 0b10-controlled exit. Killing the Sentries as quickly as possible is highly recommended in all other cases. Sentries capable of calling reinforcements will only do so when they are both tracking Cogmind and in Cogmind's field of view. Whether the Sentries themselves see Cogmind is irrelevant. In addition, Sentries in 0b10 outposts are one variant tier higher (if possible) than the current depth's Sentries. Fighting these outposts is a bad idea for an unprepared build, but larger outposts with [[Terminal]] intel are very valuable. This intel can be the same as the intel found in [[Derelict Log|Derelict Logs]]. Outpost Terminals' hack lists are entirely composed of ""report"" hacks, some of which yield intel, while the others yield only fluff text. Fluff records will always be listed first, so it's a good idea to hack the records at the bottom of the list.
Avoiding confrontation with most hostile outposts is usually fairly simple, especially with help from infowar utilities, though be wary of [[Corruption]] effects such as IFF bursts or weapon misfires that could attract unwanted attention, as well as nearby 0b10 patrols that could alert the dormant bots inside.

[[Heading:3]]0b10 Outposts (Small)[[/Heading]]
The most common type of outposts are small 0b10 outposts. They are square-shaped, have 1-2 hidden doorways on their sides, and are separated from regular cave walls by a minimum distance of 1 tile. Their main entrance is guarded on their outside by a Sentry, and contain a random mix of 4-6 dormant bots, which can be Swarmers, Grunts, Duelists or Brawlers. Those guards are stationed in front of the internal machinery. These outposts also contain 1-2 slightly damaged rewireable disabled robots. The Sentry will always try to call for a reinforcement Assault Squad.
These are also tend to be the most difficult type of 0b10 outposts to avoid attracting the attention of, due the the Sentry guarding it from the outside, as well as the usually close distance to cave walls that makes going around these outposts dangerous as well due to the hidden doorways. Using [[Terrain Scanners|Terrain Scanning]] and/or a [[Structural Scanner]] can help identify the position and field of view of the Sentry, as well as the location of hidden doorways.
[[Gallery]]Caves Outpost 2.png|Small 0b10 outpost, with 6 dormant bots, 2 rewireable bots, and a hidden doorway.[[/Gallery]]

[[Heading:3]]0b10 Outposts (Medium)[[/Heading]]
Like all 0b10 outposts, medium 0b10 outposts are square-shaped. They contain an intel Terminal, some hidden doorways, dormant Grunts and/or Swarmers and are separated from regular cave walls by a minimum distance of 2 tiles. There are two primary variations of medium 0b10 outposts. The first has an Outpost Generator inside, and may not contain a Sentry. The second is guaranteed to have a Sentry, as well as a cache of 4 weapons (all the same) in a corner, which can be accessed without risk of getting spotted by destroying the outside wall.
There are two additional variations based on the second's structure. One has been ""reappropriated"" by friendly derelicts, with all of the outpost's structure left intact, aside from the weapon cache's shell. A broken and heavily damaged 0b10 bot remains, the weapon cache contains four different parts, and the 0b10 intel Terminal has been replaced with a Derelict intel terminal, which can be freely hacked. The last variation is a largely destroyed version of the outpost, where the terminal is useless and the weapon cache mostly pillaged.

[[Heading:3]]0b10 Outposts (Large)[[/Heading]]
Like all 0b10 outposts, large 0b10 outposts are square-shaped. They contain 1-2 Sentries, an intel Terminal, a weapon cache, 6 dormant Grunts and 6 dormant Swarmers, and are separated from regular cave walls by a minimum distance of 2 tile. Like medium 0b10 outposts, weapon caches can be accessed from the outside without drawing attention by breaking the outer wall.
There are two primary variations of large 0b10 outposts. The first has one sentry and a cache of 4 weapons. The other is separated into two main parts, contains 2 Sentries, an Outpost Generator, and a large cache of 8 weapons.
There are also largely destroyed sub-variations of these, in which the terminal is useless and the weapon cache largely pillaged. In addition, some of these destroyed variants may rarely get suddenly infested by [[Assembled (4)|Assembled]], making them unsafe to explore without a Launcher. In case of infestation, blowing up the Outpost Generator if there is one could destroy a large portion of the Assembled.

[[Heading:3]]Warlord Outposts[[/Heading]]
Warlord outposts are circle-shaped, with a main entrance controlled by a Door Terminal. They are guarded by a [[Commander]] and several other Derelict bots that wander around the inside, and contain a few parts as well as an intel Terminal. The inside of the outpost is also reinforced by a ""Wall Reinforcements"" structure, which has an armor of 35. There are two main structural variants, one of which has a centered orthogonal entrance.

The Derelicts inside these outposts are friendly, and the Commander can even dispatch an escort for Cogmind. This escort will leave when reaching the next map, even if the next map is also a Caves map.

There are two additional sub-variants of Warlord outposts. The first is a sub-variant of the centered orthogonal entrance variant that has been invaded by 0b10 forces, including two [[Programmer|Programmers]], two Swarmers and one Sentry that cannot call for reinforcements but will identify Cogmind as ""Derelict reinforcements"". The intel Terminal can be safely accessed from the outside by destroying one of the walls, and while the bots inside will most likely spot Cogmind, they will not be able to exit the Outpost if no other entrance was opened. The other sub-variation is largely destroyed, where the Terminal is useless.

[[Heading:3]][[Sapper]] Outposts[[/Heading]]
Sapper Outposts are structurally very similar to regular Caves layouts and as such can be difficult to identify with purely visual means. They are separated from regular cave walls by a minimum distance of 1 tile. They are fairly rare, and contain several friendly Sappers and Sapper parts, including [[Thermoblaster|Thermoblasters]], [[Mak. Ablative Armor|Mak. Ablative Armors]] and [[Sapper Charge|Sapper Charges]].
These outposts may get attacked by two [[Assault Squad|Assaults]]. Since these Assaults can only enter the map from 0b10-controlled exits, they will always approach from the eastern side of the map, likely making them easy to avoid. 

[[Gallery]]Caves Sapper Base.png|Friendly outpost of Sappers[[/Gallery]]

[[Heading:3]]Hostile Derelict Outposts[[/Heading]]
Hostile Derelict outposts are structurally inelegant and are separated from regular cave walls by a minimum distance of 1 tile. They have 1-2 hostile Derelicts standing guard outside the structure, sometimes from positions far from any entrances, preventing them from getting quick help when spotting intruders. These outposts contain several active hostile Derelicts, some disabled Derelicts, and a few Derelict parts.
[[Gallery]]Caves Hostile Derelicts Outpost.png|Hostile Derelict outpost, with two disabled Butchers, and a Thug standing guard at the bottom-left, far from any entrances, preventing them from getting quick backup from the Derelicts inside.[[/Gallery]]


[[Heading:2]]Huge 0b10 Bases[[/Heading]]
Huge 0b10 bases are fairly rare, can only appear within Proximity Caves, and will only ever appear at the upper-right corner of the map. These bases have a enormous size of 46x46, a main four-door entrance on their left side, a secondary two-door entrance on their bottom side near the right edge of the map, and are mostly or completely made out of [[Reinforced Walls|Reinforced Barriers]]. If one of these prefabs appears, its top-right corner will contain the map's only exit as part of the prefab, forcing Cogmind to infiltrate the base.
These huge two-entrance prefabs tend to constrain the map generation process and noticeably affect the rest of the map, potentially creating unusual layouts such as extremely long corridors. There are two variations of huge 0b10 bases, both very different from the other.
[[List]]
Incomplete well-defended base - A large structure guarded by multiple 0b10 bot classes and maintained by two [[R-10 Processor|R-10 Processors]] and two [[U-05 Engineer|U-05 Engineers]].
Four lone combat bots patrol the interior, each either a Grunt, a Duelist or a Brawler.
The main entrance leads to a trapped room guarded by a Sentry and a Behemoth, making it the toughest way to enter the structure.
The secondary entrance leads into a long corridor with two indents each containing a [[Watcher]]. The room in front of the corridor is empty. The room to the right contains five rewireable Swarmers or five rewireable [[E-15 Imp|Saboteurs]], guarded by three Sentries which will be alerted by the secondary entrance's Watchers if those are not jammed.
In the middle of the two entrances is the incomplete Matter storage room, whose southern walls are regular cave walls. Some of the Earth tiles near the bottom-left of the prefab can be dug out and traveled freely without risk of [[Cave-ins|cave-ins]] (as they do not glow like regular dug-out tiles), making it possible to easily access the base through the incomplete Matter storage room.
In the center of the base is the explosive Base Generator, guarded by a Protector and a Sentry.
The top-left corner of the base is mostly unfinished, featuring incomplete machinery and walls, as well as a functional [[Fabricator]] near a few matter pods and a [[Recycling Unit]].
The two completed rooms in the upper-middle of the prefab each contain three different part stockpiles. Below these rooms are two incomplete rooms. The one to the left contains two dormant [[Hunter|Hunters]], and the one to the right contains four unpowered [[C-30 ARC|C-30 ARCs]], as well as four rewireable Grunts and two rewireable Hunters OR four rewireable Duelists and two rewireable [[Specialist|Specialists]].
The top right room of the base contains four dormant Swarmers or four dormant Grunts, two caches of two stockpiles of three parts each, and the map's only exit. The room's lower entrance can be accessed from the outside by opening the Sealed Heavy Doors using the associated Door Terminal.
Additionally, the base might get attacked by a large number of Derelicts when Cogmind first enters it.

|[[Demolisher]] testing base - Contains a large empty space used for testing Demolishers, at the center of which [[Target Drone|Target Drones]] are periodically launched. There are four active groups consisting of one Demolisher and one [[Protector]] each, each guarding one of each side of the Target Drone Dispatcher[[Comment]]I think there was a better way to word that sentence about the location and composition of active units within the base.[[/Comment]]. The Demolishers will attempt to destroy the Target Drones launched, though sometimes those will sometimes escape to the outside of the base. The top-left room of the base contains five unpowered or disabled Demolishers, as well as two caches of Launchers. The room opposite the base's main entrance contains a large stockpile of matter. There are several unpowered C-30 ARCs near the exit at the top-right corner of the base.

[[Heading:2]]Ambushes[[/Heading]]
Some hostile Derelicts and 0b10 robots will wait in ambush to attack enemies or sometimes specifically Cogmind as they pass through.
[[List]]
Thug-guarded hostile Derelict ambush - A hostile Thug guards the entrance to a small recess in the cave walls containing three dormant hostile Derelicts, which will be woken up by the Thug without a Transmission Jammer.
|[[Thief]] base ambush - A Thief base containing several presumably stolen parts, one of which may be placed just outside the entrance to lure in potential victims. A Transmission Jammer may allow fighting each thief one by one, though attacking these bases may not be worth getting parts stolen.
|0b10 ambush - Two Hunters and one Programmer hidden behind a solid wall. When Cogmind approaches, the wall will break open to let the 0b10 bots attack. This ambush can only reliably be detected through the use of a [[Sensor Array|Sensor Arrays]], a Terrain Scanner with good [[Terrain Scan Processors|Terrain Scanner Processing]], or a [[Deep Structural Scanner]].
|Random Thief ambush - A lone Thief suddenly appears from outside FOV.[[Comment]]I'm not entirely sure about that one. Is that a real  ambush, or just a wandering Thief? It's hard to tell sometimes.[[/Comment]]
|[[Spoiler]][[Master Thief]] ambush - If Cogmind has stolen from the [[Exiles (Location)|Exiles]], Master Thieves may appear near the entrances or exits of Caves maps and will only target and attack Cogmind. Their ambushes may cause some nearby prefabs, such as [[Caves#0b10_outposts_small|small 0b10 outposts]], to wind up empty of bots. This can sometimes be used to predicts exit-of-Caves-map ambushes and prepare accordingly, though by the time an empty prefab is noticed, the attack may already have started. When attacking near the end of Caves maps, they appear from outside Cogmind's FOV, which may potentially draw in nearby 0b10 patrols. Master Thieves are nearly undetectable through Sensor Arrays due to their level 4 Scan Cloak trait, and cannot be detected through a [[Seismic Detector]] due to their airborne Propulsion.[[/Spoiler]]

[[Heading:2]]Other Caches/Hidden Locations[[/Heading]]
There are a lot of possible hidden prefabs in Caves maps. Some are hidden behind solid walls, others around corners, and some others are mostly in plain sight but somewhat out of the way.

[[Heading:3]]Hidden Research Stations[[/Heading]]
Four of the hidden prefabs are research stations, where a Derelict does science of some kind. Each of these prefabs may only appear once across all Caves maps, and they are not guaranteed to appear. [[Comment]]There's probably a better way to phrase that these prefabs are ""unique but not guaranteed"".[[/Comment]]
[[List]]
[[Tinkerer]] hiding behind some [[Assembled (4)|Assembled]] - Fluff encounter. There is no other place to encounter broken Assembled within Caves.
[[GameText]]<Name>: ""I like it here. It's the perfect spot where no one bothers me, for obvious reasons.""[[/GameText]]

|[[Spoiler]]Tinkerer PL-HR7, hiding behind Sealed Heavy Doors, near [[Warlord Statue (Bot)]] - The Door Terminal is called ""W-Fans Enter Here"" and can be heard from far away. Upon entering, PL-HR7 greets Cogmind and offers their [[Heart of Steel]] prototype.[[/Spoiler]]
[[Comment]]Dialogue (incomplete): A derelict excitedly rushes up: ""Another fan!""[[/Comment]]

|[[Spoiler]]A Tinkerer hidden behind a Locked Door - Sometimes the cave walls won't fully surround the machinery, making it possible to spot the Tinkerer inside without intending to. When spotting the Tinkerer, they will explain that they are about to be attacked, and entrust Cogmind with their [[Molecular Deconstructor]] prototype, as well as the password to access it. Some time after this, 0b10 hostiles including Programmers, Specialists and Hunters will appear nearby along with an announcement: [[GameText]]PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: Unaware incursion detected. Likely classification: Search and Destroy. And maybe Retrieve. Something like that, yeah.[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]""They're coming to take away my research again!""[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]""You're not Unaware, and look menacing enough... take it and get as far away from here as you can. Quickly!""[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]""The password is <CODE>.""[[/GameText]][[/Spoiler]]

|[[Spoiler]]Derelict C-55 Analyst and [[Core Expander]] concealed behind a solid wall - One of the most well-hidden prefabs. Sometimes another Derelict can be encountered near the C-55 Analyst's hiding spot, explaining that they were following a lone Researcher but lost track of them. Upon entering, the [[Researcher]] will explain their situation, and will then roam the map aimlessly. The [[Core Expander]] is so powerful that it alone can be a good reason to go into Caves, even though this prefab isn't guaranteed to show up.
[[GameText]]C-55 Analyst: ""How did you find me??? Please don't shoot, I'm a Derelict like you now! I just had to learn more about this intriguing device...""[[/GameText]][[/Spoiler]]

[[Heading:3]]Delusional Mutants[[/Heading]] [[Comment]]I'm not sure, but i think only one of these can appear in each run?[[/Comment]]
A hostile Mutant hidden behind walls and a Locked Door, guarding either parts or rewireable Unaware. Their hideout is not guaranteed to be fully enclosed by walls. They are referred to as ""delusional"" by scoresheets' ""History"" section.

[[Heading:3]]Hidden Caches[[/Heading]]
There are a lot of hidden cache prefabs, each hidden in one of many ways:
[[List]]Some caches are fully hidden behind solid walls. These will contain either only [[Dirty Datajack|Dirty Datajacks]] or only [[Self-destruct Interrupter|Self-destruct Interrupters]]. They can only be detected through Terrain Scanning, Structural Scanning or rarely Caves map layout derelict intel. The Self-destruct Interrupters inside those caches are capable of preventing the self-destruction of nearby unaware parts, possibly indicating their presence.
|Many caches are hidden inside of difficult-to-spot paths, usually requiring diagonal movement to enter. The paths may be trapped with friendly Derelict Traps[[Comment]]Part of what i'm saying here is effectively ""trapped with traps"", maybe there's a way to avoid that repeat?[[/Comment]], so be careful when corrupted. These will either contain a handful of parts, in which case the cache may be additionally protected by a Sealed Door and the relevant Derelict Door Terminal, or several Dirty Datajacks.
|Some caches contain a large amount of [[Scrap]]. These Scrap rooms aren't very well hidden, and sometimes have a functional door separating them from the rest of the caves. Fully looting these Scrap piles may be difficult, as they will quickly fill the small space they're contained within, possibly preventing some Scrap piles from yielding everything they otherwise would have.
|Some caches are hidden behind a Sealed Door and its relevant Derelict Door Terminal, and contain a large number of parts. These may occasionally contain a friendly dormant Derelict guard.
|[[Spoiler]]DNI cache - A unique prefab protected by Reinforced Barriers and Sealed Doors, containing a [[Dimensional Node Initializer]] and a fluff lore Terminal.

[[Heading:3]]""Out of the way"" Robots[[/Heading]] [[Comment]]There's probably a better title for this heading.[[/Comment]]

""Remains of a fight""[[Comment]]There's got to be a better name for this[[/Comment]] - A dead end containing damaged parts and broken 0b10 and/or Derelict bots, as though there had been a fight. Both common and easy to find. Those bots' parts can be helpful if Cogmind is in a bad state, though be wary if corrupted, as the area may contain friendly Derelict Traps.
Non-combat Derelict bot graveyard - A small slightly hidden room containing lots of broken non-combat Derelict bots, including Decomposers[[Comment]]It's been a while, i'm not sure Decomposers can appear in those graveyards, but they probably can?

Since they are broken, their respective traits do not function.[[Comment]]""Their traits don't function"" carries the point across, but doesn't feel like an otherwise valid sentence. Does it actually work as a sentence?[[/Comment]]
Broken [[A-27 Freighter|Freighter]] - A Broken Freighter and Broken Specialist guard in a small slightly concealed room. There may be a friendly derelict guarding the outside. The Freighter contains intact prototype parts. If Cogmind spots the broken Freighter, it is possible a new Freighter and smaller than usual escort of a Protector and C-30 ARC will be sent to retrieve the parts.
Guarded [[Hauler]] - A Grunt squad guarding a Hauler slightly out-of-sight inside a dead end. The Hauler has a fixed pool of loot that can be contained:

[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There are primarily 2 types of exits in Caves, depending on which types of caves map it is:
[[List]]Main access exit: There is always a single main floor exit on the second Caves map and in Proximity Caves maps, and it always leads to the next standard depth map (Factory or Research). This exit is typically on the far right side of the map. Sometimes this exit is heavily guarded and part of an 0b10 base.|Caves exit: In the first Caves map, the only exit available is to the second Caves map.|Special Branch exit: Depending on the type of map, each caves exit will have a special Branch exit typically on the left side of the map. For Lower Caves, this exit goes to [[Zion]] or [[Data Miner (Location)]]. For Upper Caves, this exit goes to [[Warlord (Location)]] or [[Zhirov (Location)]][[/List]]

[[Heading]]Notes[[/Heading]]
Caves has one of the largest collections of prefabs of all the maps in the game, with a wide mix of good and bad prefabs. One of the strongest prefabs, the derelict [[Researcher]] with a [[Core Expander]], is so strong that it alone can be a good reason to go into Caves.

Friendly Derelicts will not move from their guard position, but they will engage any 0b10 forces they see. Leading hostile squads into them can let them do the fighting for you. This is particularly easy to do for fast airborne builds who don't want to engage in combat and can use the Derelicts as a distraction. These Derelicts can also be safely salvaged for parts and will not retaliate.

"Cetus","Location","Cetus is a [[0b10]]-controlled [[Factory]] branch between -6 and -4 that can only be entered through [[Extension]]. This map is the same every game with no variation. There are 2 groups of a [[Watcher]] + 4 [[Cetus Guard|Cetus Guards]]. One is on the bottom left side of the map and the other is on the top right. In the center is the Cetus Manufacturing Module machine, a few scattered lore [[Terminal|Terminals]], and a Terminal that locks up the Cetus Mainframe.
If [[A7]] is rescued and kept alive, they will provide a special Terminal hack for the manufacturing module that will create 5 Cogmind-controlled [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]]. A7 also has a special interaction upon seeing the Cetus Mainframe. After exiting the map, they will give a special robot hack that [[Redacted]]decreases the reaction time of [[MAIN.C]], causing them to take much longer to attack[[/Redacted]].
One special bot appears on this map: [[Revision 17]]. After destroying all 8 Cetus Guards, they will appear and thank Cogmind for freeing them. If both Revision 17 and the Cetus Manufacturing Module are still intact when leaving the map, it is possible to [[Revision 17 (Alignment)|align with them]] and cause a special -3 [[Research]] event where Revision 17 attacks the map.
There are no standard [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]] or [[Assault Squad|Assaults]] on this map. However, there is a special patrol [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] spawn. 750 turns after entering the map and every further 250 turns, 2 ARCs will spawn from random exits and roam around the map. It is best to exit the map before too many of these ARCs start showing up.

"Challenges Achievements","Other","Challenges [[Achievements]] are earned by completing certain challenging feats, demonstrating the player's large experience with the game. Only some of them are likely to be obtained naturally by players not actively trying to earn them. 2 of the 27 Challenges Achievements have hidden descriptions that are only revealed after completing them. The borders of Challenges Achievements tend to indicate their general difficulty as a Challenges Achievement[[Comment]]Rincewind being the biggest exception. Why is that one considered ""easy""? It's basically the most difficult one in here.[[/Comment]], with more ""intense"" borders meaning higher difficulty.

[[Comment]]This warning is supposed to be there for all articles about achievement types, including those that do not have any Redacted-level spoilers.[[/Comment]]
(The visibility for the explanations, strategies and descriptions of hidden achievements is set to at least ""Spoilers"", and may be set to ""Redacted"" for achievements where that would be relevant. Remember to change your spoilers settings to ""None"" if you do not wish to see the explanations, strategies and descriptions of hidden achievements you have not yet obtained!)

Warning: The writer of this article has not yet earned the ""Full Golem"" Achievement, and as such its description in this page is a (likely accurate) guess instead of being the official description.

[[Comment]]Important note : A lot of Challenges Achievements' descriptions mention by name some spoiler-tier stuff, such as the Cetus Guards or Transdimensional Reconstructors.
Normally, these names would be contained within a Link tag.
However, because those Achievements' descriptions are not hidden by the game (the descriptions themselves aren't spoiler-tier), these names should not be contained within a Link tag, because that would cause them to appear spoilered to anyone with a spoiler setting of ""None"".[[/Comment]]

[[Heading]]Challenge difficulty level 1[[/Heading]]
[[List]]Exterminator: Destroy 15 [[Assembled]] in the [[Mines]].
Strategy: This Achievement is seed-dependent, and may be impossible on some seeds. When attempting to get this Achievement on a random seed, visit the Mines and bring at least one [[Launchers|launcher]]. If an Assembled infestation occurs, try to find and reach the source as quickly as possible, to be able to blow up the Assembled while they are still in a somewhat large group. Having a [[Seismic Detector]] can help locate the Assembled faster.
|Killing Spree: Achieve a kill streak of 20 hostiles.
|Preemptive Strike: Destroy a visible [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] before it deploys.
|Left-hand Path: Destroy all Cetus Guards without any help from allies.
|Below: Visit and survive 2 [[Wastes|Waste]] areas.
|Streaker: Enter a main complex map at -5 or above as a naked core, and find an exit (do not have to remain naked).
|Rincewind: Use at least 10 Transdimensional Reconstructors (any variant).
|Leap Before You Look: Enter 10 unidentified exits.
Strategy: It is possible to deduce the identity of exits without actually ""identifying"" the exit, through various means. For example, successfully hacking branch exits would cause all remaining unidentified exits to be main exits, and vice-versa. It is also possible to identify some exits by where they are or what's around them, such as [[Mines]] exits, which are always surrounded by mining equipment. This is especially true in branches, where all exits are distinguishable from each other. This can allow entering exits the game considers ""unidentified"", while actually knowing where they lead, making this Achievement much easier. If you have a [[Signal Interpreters|Signal Interpreter]] attached, remember to deactivate it before approaching any exits you would want to take while unidentified, as it would automatically identify them.[[/List]]

[[Heading]]Challenge difficulty level 2[[/Heading]]
[[List]]
Boltbath: Achieve a kill streak of 35 hostiles.
|Torch: Inflict 30,000 thermal damage across an entire run.
|Magneto: Inflict 30,000 electromagnetic damage across an entire run.
|Punisher: Inflict 30,000 kinetic damage across an entire run.
|Gladiator: Destroy 200 hostiles via melee.
|Infiltrator: Enter and survive 2 [[Garrison|Garrisons]] on a single floor.
|Desperate Times: Enter a main complex map at -3 or above as a naked core with no inventory items, and find an exit (do not have to remain naked).
|Monster: Kill at least 20 inhabitants of Zion.
|Equal Opportunity Bot: Destroy 30 different classes of robot.
Notes: What counts as a ""class"" isn't immediately obvious. For example, the in-game examination window classifies [[Thug|Thugs]] as ""Thug (Derelict)"" and [[Grunt|Grunts]] as ""Grunt"", but they are considered the same class for scoresheet purposes. This achievement relies on the scoresheet definition, making it somewhat confusing.
As a general rule, robots with different sprites will count as different classes (with the exception of unique NPCs, which do not count at all).
The exact definition is likely related to the ""build type"" and purpose of each robot. For example, both [[Packrat|Packrats]] and [[Recycler|Recyclers]] have the purpose of collecting parts and have similar parts. Both Thugs and Grunts are two-legged, have a [[Cooling Devices|Heat Sink]], and use thermal guns. [[Cobbler|Cobblers]] and [[Mechanic|Mechanics]], however, are completely different in both build and purpose, and as such count as different classes.
The relevant scoresheet statistic is ""Classes Destroyed"".

"Chute Trap","Other","Chute Traps are the only way to access [[Wastes]]. They are [[Traps]] found exclusively in the first [[Factory]] map of each depth from -7 to -4. In other words, additional Factory maps reached via Wastes or [[Garrison]] looping do not have any Chute Traps. Like [[Alarm Trap|Alarm Traps]] and [[Ambush Trap|Ambush Traps]], they cannot be extracted using a [[Trap Extractors|Trap Extractor]]. Unlike them, however, Chute Traps can be reprogrammed using a [[Melee Datajacks|Melee Datajack]], not only disarmed.

If [[High Security]] is triggered, all Chute Traps on the map will disappear after 50 turns.

[[Heading]]Effects[[/Heading]]
When triggered, a Chute Trap will bring the victim to the array's Wastes map, permanently sealing itself afterwards. Victims can be followed by triggering a different Chute Trap from the same array. This is because each Chute Trap array leads to a different Wastes map. If Cogmind falls victim to one, Cogmind's [[Alert]] will drop enormously, and any allies currently following Cogmind will fall into Wastes one after the other following Cogmind, so long as they are not immobile, even if there weren't enough remaining Chute Traps for them to follow. If Cogmind follows a purple allied [[Derelict]] into Wastes, the Derelict will thank Cogmind for not abandoning them.
Standing on a known Chute Trap then manually triggering will grant the ""Wheee!"" [[Mechanics Achievements|Mechanics Achievement]] if it wasn't already unlocked.

[[Heading]][[K-01 Serf|K-01 Serf]] Interactions[[/Heading]]
On Factory maps containing Chute Traps, K-01 Serfs sometimes spawn carrying disabled 0b10 bots towards Chutes, and some disabled 0b10 bots can sometimes be stored inside rooms. If a disabled bot is within range of a Worker, the Worker will try to latch onto the bot and push them into the nearest Chute Trap, even if the bot is only temporarily disabled. If a Worker successfully pushes a disabled robot into a Chute Trap, the disabled bot will fall through but the trap will [[I]]not[[/I]] permanently seal itself afterwards. [[Comment]]If Cogmind witness this,[[/Comment]] The Chute Trap will then be revealed (due to a bug in Beta 15, Chute Traps are revealed this way even if Cogmind doesn't witness this happening).

Because Serfs use Chute Traps, the [[GameText]]find_chute[[/GameText]] hack can be used when hacking one using a [[Datajacks|Datajack]], which reveals the nearest Chute Trap the Serf can use.

[[Spoiler]]The [[RIF]] hacks [[GameText]]hold_bot[[/GameText]] and [[GameText]]start_disposal[[/GameText]] can be used together to make a Serf latch onto and move a bot into a Chute Trap, so long as the Serf is not currently evacuating and has access to a Chute Trap. While the [[GameText]]hold_bot[[/GameText]] hack normally has a turn limit of 25, the [[GameText]]start_disposal[[/GameText]] hack overrides it.[[/Spoiler]]

"Command","Location","Command is an [[0b10]]-controlled [[Access]] [[Branch]] that only appears on -1. It is the home to [[MAIN.C (Shell)|MAIN.C]], the mastermind AI behind 0b10, and huge groups of his forces. Command features a heavily patrolled dense layout that feels more similar to [[Research]] than [[Access]] with smaller corridors and generally smaller heavily interconnected rooms with Emergency Accesses connecting many rooms. One unique feature of Command is that dispatched squads are not spawned from an exit. Instead, there is a dedicated ""Garrison"" area in the map where bots are dispatched from. This means that unlike most maps, it is possible for Command to run out of squads to send after Cogmind.

[[Heading]]Layout[[/Heading]]
The overall structure of Command can be split into 3 groups. The right and left sections are both randomly generated per seed, although there are several fixed features per each. The center section of the map is always fixed and in the same location.
[[Heading:2]]Right section[[/Heading]]
The right side of the map is more like a ""normal"" 0b10 floor, with most typical types of [[Interactive Machine|Interactive Machines]] available and standard [[Squad|Squads]] throughout. There are a few special machines present here, including a [[Phase Generator]] and 2 Cave Seal [[Terminal|Terminals]]. There is an extremely heavily guarded exit that is heavily trapped with [[Stasis Trap|Stasis Traps]], with 2 [[Alpha 7|Alpha 7s]], 2 [[Striker|Strikers]], 4 [[Executioner|Executioners]], and 2 [[B-99 Colossus|B-99 Colossi]] serving as guards. This section is connected to the center section at the top, center, and bottom of the map.
[[Heading:2]]Center Section[[/Heading]]
The center of the map is always fixed, with a few distinct sub-areas.
[[Heading:3]]Doom Corridor[[/Heading]]
The Doom Corridor is a 5 tile wide corridor that contains multiple unpowered Warlord variations, 2 [[Combat Programmer|Combat Programmers]] and 2 [[M Guard|M Guards]]. Trying to go farther into the map requires killing or bypassing these tough [[Prototype Robot|Prototype Robots]].
[[Heading:3]]Command ""Garrisons""[[/Heading]]
Above and below the Doom Corridor are passages to the ""Garrison"" sections of the map. They are not the usual [[Garrison Access]] machines but do behave similarly in function, being able to dispatch bots as part of normal summoned squads like [[Investigation Squad|Investigation]], [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcement]], and [[Extermination Squad|Extermination]] squads. Each Garrison has a fixed set of bots that are initially present. Each garrison has the following list of bots:
[[List]]
12 [[B-74 Champion|B-74 Champions]]|
18 [[C-30 ARC]]|
6 [[C-57 Dissector|C-57 Dissector]]|
6 [[D-83 Annihilator|D-83 Annihilators]]|
48 [[G-73 Enforcer|G-73 Enforcers]]|
24 [[H-88 Terminator|H-88 Terminators]]|
6 [[I-47 Archangel|I-47 Archangels]]|
12 [[L-61 Swordsman|L-61 Swordsmen]]|
24 [[P-80 Master|P-80 Masters]]|
18 [[S-43 Plague|S-43 Plagues]]|
12 [[X-87 Electro|X-87 Electros]]
[[/List]]
[[Heading:3]]MAIN.C room[[/Heading]]
Above the Doom Corridor are some [[Reinforced Walls#Command|Sealed Barriers]] with 80 armor. surrounded by Reinforced Barriers with 100 armor. They are locked by a Terminal with a 60% base open chance. Past this hall is a large room with a big chunk of machinery called the 0b10 Conduit that is hooked up to MAIN.C. 100 armor Heavy Barriers appear on the bottom left side of this room that block off the left section of Command.
[[Heading:3]]Left Section[[/Heading]]
The left section is similar in layout to the right side, although it tends to be much smaller. Unique features on this side include an unguarded exit, a Wave Inhibitor machine, and a cache of high rating parts near the top-right or bottom-right side of the map.
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:3]][[Phase Generator]][[/Heading]]The Phase Generator is an explosive machine with a distinctive look and is always found on the right section of Command. This Phase Generator will block most forms of bot detection and and terrain scanning. [[Sensor Arrays]] except for the [[Active Sensor Suite]], [[Terrain Scanners]], and the [[Structural Scanner]] all do not work in Command unless the Phase Generator is destroyed. [[FarCom]], however, does work even through the Phase Generator. This machine also keeps Phase Walls powered, which look just like normal walls unless destroyed or an 0b10 bot walks into one. These walls disappear when the Phase Generator is destroyed.
[[Heading:3]]Cave Seal[[/Heading]]
Cave Seals are a special type of Terminal that will spawn bots when opened. There are always 2 Cave Seals on the right side of the map. After being opened, large groups of bots will appear roughly 10 turns, 125 turns, 225 turns, and 375 turns after opening. The type of bots depend on various factions and alignments Cogmind has interacted with.
[[Heading:3]]Wave Inhibitor[[/Heading]]
The Wave Inhibitor, only appears on the left section of the map. It will prevent teleportation via the [[Transdimensional Reconstructor|Regular]] and [[Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor|Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructors]]. It also blocks calling for allies when [[Imprint|Imprinted]].

[[Heading:2]]Cave Seal contents[[/Heading]]
The contents of the cave seal depend on alignment. Warlord/Imprint alignment are mutually exclusive and take priority over Core Reset Matrix seals. If no other options apply, wild cave [[Derelict|Derelicts]] will appear. For allied seals, some of the bots will follow Cogmind around and others will roam the map randomly.
[[Heading:3]]Warlord seal[[/Heading]]
Warlord seal bots are white colored, meaning that they are allied to Cogmind but do not generate [[Alert]]. Warlord will always come out of the first opened cave seal. They can contain the following bots by default:
[[List]][[Warlord (Command)|Warlord]] (first only)|[[Butcher (7)]]|[[Fireman (7)]]|[[Guerrilla (7)]]|[[Knight]]|[[Marauder (8)]]|[[Martyr (7)]]|[[Mutant (8)]]|[[Savage (7)]]|[[Thug (7)]]|[[Troll]]|[[Wasp (7)]]|[[Wizard (7)]][[/List]]
If Warlord forces have gained a force multiplier by the [[Encrypted Comm Array]] mechanics, more bots and stronger bots will appear from these seals. If the multiplier is high enough, the following bots can additionally be found in these seals:
[[List]][[Dragon]]|[[Hydra]]|[[Surgeon (6)]][[/List]]
[[Heading:3]]Imprint seal[[/Heading]]
Imprint seals contain purple-colored bots which [[I]]will[[/I]] generate Alert for Cogmind. Be mindful of alert generation as it is extremely easy to trigger [[High Security]] very soon after opening an Imprint seal. Unlike most purple allies, some of these bots will wander off without following Cogmind. If a Core Reset Matrix has been used prior to opening the seal, any [[Experimental|Experimentals]], [[Z-Light|Z-Lights]], and [[Z-Heavy|Z-Heavies]] will be blue and controllable instead of purple uncontrollable. They can contain the following bots:
[[List]][[Fireman (7)]]|[[Martyr (7)]]|[[Mutant (8)]]|[[Wizard (7)]]|[[Z-Experimental (8)]]|[[Z-Experimental (10)]]|[[Z-Heavy (9)]]|[[Z-Light (9)]][[/List]]
[[Heading:3]][[Core Reset Matrix]] (CRM) seal[[/Heading]]
CRM seals consist only of [[Golem|Golems]] and [[Assembled (7)|Assembled]]. There is either 0 or 1 Golem per spawn, and about a dozen Assembled each time.
[[Heading:3]]Wild Derelicts[[/Heading]]
Wild Derelict seal bots are brown-colored meaning hostile unaligned Derelicts that do not contribute to Alert. They can contain the following bots:
[[List]][[Butcher (7)]]|[[Fireman (7)]]|[[Guerrilla (7)]]|[[Mutant (8)]]|[[Savage (7)]]|[[Thug (7)]]|[[Wizard (7)]][[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]Command cache contents[[/Heading]]
There are several groups of parts that can appear as part of this cache. There is one special item which contains many otherwise unique [[Testing]]-only parts, and the Gamma Refractor that can't appear anywhere else.
[[Heading:3]]Unique item[[/Heading]]
This unique item appears in the center of the cache:

There are 6 of these weapon items in the top left of the cache:
[[List]][[Enh. Nova Cannon]]|[[Graviton Cannon]]|[[Hvy. Hardcell Cannon]]|[[Hvy. Quantum Rifle]][[/List]]
[[Heading:3]]Gaining Access[[/Heading]]
The door terminal only has a 10% chance of hacking, though this hack is only available while MAIN.C is still alive. Other methods of entry will require bypassing the Sealed Heavy Doors via Spacefold, digging through with strong Thermal damage, or digging through the side with a Matter Drive or Laser Shovel.
[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There are 3 exits on Command maps. All are very uniquely identifiable:
[[List]]Right-side Surface exit: This exit is behind a 4 tile wide doorway on the right side of the map. This exit is extremely heavily guarded, with 2 [[Alpha 7|Alpha 7s]], 2 [[Striker|Strikers]], 2 [[Executioner|Executioners]], and 2 [[B-99 Colossus|Colossi]]. There are also 10 rows of stasis traps and a further layer of stasis traps surrounding the Access Shell that make flying or core hovering through a nightmare. Launchers can be used to destroy the stasis traps without triggering them manually, or a [[Stasis Canceller]] can be used to ignore them altogether. It is usually better to use a strong digging method to dig through the back of the exit to avoid most of the head-on fire.|Left-side Surface exit: This exit is on the left side of the map and can be located by a 2 tile wide corridor dead-ending in it along with Reinforced Barriers surrounding it. There are no guards at this exit.|[[Access_0]] exit: This exit can be found on the far left of the map, past any 0b10 level. There is a [[Dimensional Node Initializer]] activated here, which means that a [[Transdimensional Reconstructor|Regular]] or [[Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor]] will always result in coming to this exit as long as the Wave Inhibitor is destroyed. It is possible to dig to this location, although it will be very painful with many cave-ins and there is no easy way to identify where the exit is.[[/List]]

[[Heading]]MAIN.C[[/Heading]]
MAIN.C is a very unique encounter in the game. Unlike most bots in the game, he has 2 different forms. The [[MAIN.C (Shell)|base form]] is a 3x3 tile slow-moving tank. The [[MAIN.C|second form]] drops down to a 1x1 tile fast hover-bot. Both forms have an ability that regenerates 5 core integrity every turn. He has much state-dependent dialogue, and multiple interactions with different bots in Command.
[[Heading:2]]Fighting[[/Heading]]
MAIN.C will instantly attack when opening the door to his room, then monologue a bit. On defeating the first phase, MAIN.C will typically offer a choice to continue fighting or to surrender. Surrendering will start the process for a W8 [[Wintypes|Wintype]], discussed below. MAIN.C will not offer the surrender option if Cogmind has used a [[Core Reset Matrix]] or if [[Warlord (Command)|Warlord]] is alive and present on the map. If continuing to fight, the Command Garrisons will be activated, leaving the large swathes of Garrison bots to swarm around the map aimlessly. The Doom Corridor guards and the right side exit guards will also be summoned directly to the MAIN.C room, if alive. If MAIN.C is destroyed, a large percentage of all 0b10-aligned bots will turn into a new unaligned faction, hostile to other 0b10 bots. Every 200 turns, more bots will randomly switch between the two factions, continuing to destroy each other. 600 turns after MAIN.C's death, all remaining combat hostiles will turn unpowered.
[[Heading:3]]Defeating MAIN.C Strategy[[/Heading]]
See [[Strategy/Defeating MAIN.C]]
[[Heading:2]]Warlord interaction[[/Heading]]
If phase one of MAIN.C sees Warlord, he will unpower Warlord permanently. This ability can be avoided in two ways. The first is to destroy phase one of MAIN.C before Warlord comes into view. This is only really possible for an airborne builds that can leave Warlord behind to try and fight phase one before Warlord can catch up. The second way is to use the MAIN.C hack. There are a few turns of wiggle room before Warlord is shut down, so make sure to use this hack via some kind of remote [[Datajacks| Datajack]] immediately on entering the MAIN.C room.
[[Heading:3]]W7: ""Establishing Free Derelict Territories""[[/Heading]]
If MAIN.C is destroyed and Warlord is still alive and has not been unpowered, a W7 will be achieved. Using the MAIN.C hack first makes this wintype much easier to accomplish to stop the unpowering ability.
[[Heading:2]]MAIN.C Hack[[/Heading]]If [[A7]] was rescued in [[Extension]] and his quest to see the [[Cetus]] Mainframe is completed, they will provide the MAIN.C hack. Using this hack has two primary effects. It stops Warlord from being shut down after being spotted and it dramatically slows down MAIN.C's action speed. Every free turn, there is a chance that MAIN.C will be unable to move with the text [[GameText]]MAIN.C reaction time slowed by virus[[/GameText]]. This substantially decreases the amount of damage output, although it doesn't slow down any of the Command Garrison bots from running into the room quickly.
[[Heading:2]]Zhirov[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Command Zhirov.png|Zhirov, Perun, and Svarog arriving to finish off MAIN.C[[/Image]]
If [[Zhirov]]'s SGEMP quest is completed and Zhirov is still alive, he will show up along with [[Perun]] and [[Svarog]] after Cogmind defeats phase one of MAIN.C. A Modified SGEMP will be detonated, unpowering every 0b10-aligned bot on the floor. This also includes Warlord if he is present on the map. After this, Zhirov will remark that there is a lot of cleaning up to do, then he and his friends will teleport out. This does not count as a MAIN.C kill for the run (a + on the scoresheet). However, it does provide a good method to prepare for Access_0 with all of the good loot available and is generally a good way to explore Command.
[[Heading:2]][[Sigix Warrior]]/[[Sigix Exoskeleton]] interaction[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Command Sigix Shell.png|Special MAIN.C phase 2 reinforcements to fight the Sigix[[/Image]]
If Cogmind has activated the Sigix Warrior or has gotten into the Exoskeleton, MAIN.C will be much more prepared for phase 2. In addition to the second phase of MAIN.C himself, there will also be 4 [[M Shell/Atk]] and 4 [[M Shell/Def]] that appear from the outer shell. The Defensive shells are not too much stronger than an average [[Protector]], but the Offensive shells boast a ridiculously strong offensive loadout with many of the best offensive utilities in the game. Fighting them head-on is not an easy task.
[[Heading:2]]W1: ""Establishing 0b11""[[/Heading]]
This wintype can be achieved by destroying both phases of MAIN.C and taking either Surface exit off of the map. If Cogmind has consumed a Core Reset Matrix, a W2 will override this win.
[[Heading:2]]W4: ""Assimilated 0b10""[[/Heading]]
This win can be achieved in one of two ways using the 0b10 conduit that MAIN.C is normally hooked up into. The machine must remain intact in order to achieve this wintype. The first is to destroy both phases of MAIN.C and then stand next to one of the corners of the conduit. If using [[RIF]], MAIN.C does not need to be destroyed. Using RIF is by far the easier technique as the MAIN.C first phase is very slow and easy to lure away by a fast flight build that can hop back over MAIN.C and run into the machine.
[[Heading:2]]W8: ""Fortifying 0b10""/Surrender[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Command EQ-Series.png|[[Enhanced Q-Series]] attacking 0b10[[/Image]]
If the surrender option is chosen after defeating MAIN.C phase one, a different ending will begin. First, all 0b10 bots including MAIN.C will become friendly to Cogmind with the log entry [[GameText]]LRC-V3 rejoined 0b10. Threat protocols amended.[[/GameText]] MAIN.C will give Cogmind complete map intel and say to go stock up in the Command cache, which will open automatically on approach. At this point, the Access_0 Dimensional Slip Node will explode and the exit will be closed. After 100 moves or approximately 400 turns, another two alerts will indicate [[GameText]]System intrusion detected. Garrison defenses under attack.[[/GameText]] and [[GameText]]All Command Garrisons activated[[/GameText]]. Garrisons be significantly sabotaged, and after 40 more turns, a large group of [[Enhanced Q-Series]] will teleport into random locations on the map. After every 100 turns or so, more waves of Q-Series will spawn in. These bots have randomized loadouts just like regular [[Q-Series]] do, but are much more powerful. MAIN.C will order Cogmind to fight them off. Be careful of Launcher uses and misses/misfires for this event. If 0b10 bots are attacked enough times, MAIN.C will announce Cogmind as a traitor and all 0b10 bots will once again become hostile.
The Enhanced Q-Series waves will go on endlessly without intervention. There is some amount of contribution required to be able to complete the event. The details are not well understood, but participating in kills will move the event closer to completion. Expect between one to two dozen Enhanced Q-Series kills required before the event can be completed. If Cogmind is not contributing enough, when the 4th wave spawns, MAIN.C will tell Cogmind to help out a bit more or else they might lose. After enough kills, MAIN.C will say that the reinforcements seem to have stopped coming and must prepare for the future. This will end the run and result in the W8 ending.

[[Heading]]No Info Only War[[/Heading]]
[[B]]No Info, Only War[[/B]] - Ever wondered what it's like to get a ""pure"" combat win without any of those pesky sensors or scanners or burner hackware, pooling all your resources not into avoiding combat or escaping the complex quickly, but into nothing but sheer, overwhelming power? Then you might be interested in this challenge!
Forbidden: Much like leiavoia's Tank it to the Top, you must use only grounded propulsion, not even core hover if you can avoid it. Strictly forbidden parts are anything listed within Cogminder as [[Hackware]] or [[Infowar]], and no [[Datajacks]] or [[Component Analysis Suites]] either! Alignment options: [[RIF]] and [[Data Conduit|DC]] are also forbidden. If you get [[FarCom]], you must aggro the [[Exiles (Group)]] before leaving the map. You are also not allowed to enter the [[Hub_04(d)|Hub]] branch map.
Permitted: Unlike Tank it to the Top, you can go wherever you want (you may not even be able to ID exits, after all!), and you can use any unauthorized hacks you know, if you can succeed with no hackware! Feel free to restrict those for extra points (the points mean nothing). Parts that don't strictly help mid-combat, but don't give intel, like recalibrators or salvage targeting, are allowed and even recommended. Alignment options: [[Encrypted Comm Array|ECA]], [[UFD]], [[Core Reset Matrix|CRM]], and [[Imprint]] are fine.
Objective: Surface exit. Extended is bonus points!

[[Heading]]Tank It To The Top[[/Heading]]
leiavoia's ""Tank It To The Top"" Challenge -  Showing just how hard is it to play combat treads from a new-player perspective. Think you're tough? Give it a try!
Da Rulez: You have to take a combat build (treads recommended, but any grounded propulsion type is allowed) through a ""straight shot"" run. You may not take any branches, including [[Mines]], [[Caves]], [[DSF]] and [[Garrison|Garrisons]]. [[Wastes|Waste]] [[Chute Trap|Chutes]] are allowed. Access surface exit is the goal (""W0""). This challenge is meant to be ""spoiler free"", so you may not use any ""unauthorized"" terminal hacks that would be unknown to a new player (no botnets!). You can wear other prop in an emergency, but not as an alternative, and not as ""hover treads"".
Background: It turns out that doing this is really difficult. I wanted to make a n00b-friendly combat how-to, but keep getting my bot kicked. Attempts at doing this lately all burn down when alert finally catches up. Treads builds desperately want to escape to branches, but when there are none, you need to find a different method. Let me know if you make it work, and bonus points if its on video. Happy treading!

"Companion Sword","Part","The Companion Sword is a unique talking melee weapon that can only appear in [[Scraptown]]. It is contained in a room called The Sword, locked for the protection of [[Derelict|Derelicts]], none of whom have survived using the Companion Sword for long. The Companion Sword is quite talkative and will often comment about the state of the run, take pleasure in destroying things, and complain if it is detached or is not the only weapon attached. The Companion Sword has a variety of special effects that are not described by the in-game effect.

[[Heading]]Special Effects[[/Heading]]

Core Loss|The Companion Sword deals between 5-10 core damage directly to Cogmind's core on a normal attack. Can't be reduced by [[Core Shieldings]] or [[Defensive Utilities]]. Only happens when Cogmind attacks something with the Companion Sword.|Uncommon||
Bot Disruption|A bot is instantly disrupted on a normal attack. As with normal disruption, a disrupted bot can be rewired as long as it isn't hacking immune. The log message [[GameText]][target] shuts down.[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens.|Rare||
Sever|A part is severed off of a bot on a normal attack. This effect can hit through the Dismemberment immunity, unlike standard Sever critical hits.|Rare||
Surge of Energy|This effect instantly kills a bot on a normal attack. The log message [[GameText]][target] is pierced by a surge of energy.[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens.|Rare

[[Heading]]Transformation[[/Heading]]
The Companion Sword can transform into the [[Quantum Companion]] in one of two ways:
[[List]]Use: The transformation can occur from time wearing and use. Killing bots while keeping it equipped for a long period of time will make it transform the quickest.|[[Subatomic Replicator]]: The Replicator can instantly create the Quantum Companion from a Companion Sword.[[/List]]
When the Companion Sword transforms, the following game log message will appear: [[GameText]]Companion Sword blips out of existence for a moment, then partially fades back in.[[/GameText]] The Companion Sword will also comment on it, saying one of multiple possible [[Companion Sword#upgrading|upgrade lines]].

[[Heading]]Dialogue[[/Heading]]
The following is a non-comprehensive list of Companion Sword dialogue:

"Core Reset Matrix","Part","The Core Reset Matrix, or CRM, is a consumable [[Alien Artifacts]] that provides one of the [[Alignment|alignment]] options in the game. It provides a combination of helpful and unhelpful effects, and as such should often not be used in every game unlike other consumable items.

[[Heading]]Effects[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:3]]Alien Alliance[[/Heading]]
[[Assembled]] and [[Golem|Golems]] will turn from hostile to purple uncontrollable allies. Additionally, if [[Imprint|Imprinted]], [[Redacted]][[Z-Light|Z-Lights]], [[Z-Heavy|Z-Heavies]], and [[Experimental|Experimentals]] summoned from [[Command]] cave seals will turn from purple into blue controllable allies.[[/Redacted]]
[[Heading:3]]Alien Artifact Detection[[/Heading]]
After consuming the CRM and when entering a new map, the locations and types of all Alien Artifacts are revealed on the map. The part IDs of all Alien Artifacts are also granted to Cogmind.
[[Heading:3]]Alien Language Understanding[[/Heading]]
Cogmind will be able to understand the speech of the [[Sigix Containment Pod]] when rescued.
[[Redacted]][[Heading:3]]Cave Seal Allies[[/Heading]]
If a Command cave seal is opened and Cogmind is not Imprinted or allied with [[Warlord]], cave seals will initially contain 1 Golem and 10-13 Assembled.[[/Redacted]]
[[Heading:3]][[Corruption]] Cleanse[[/Heading]]
Corruption is reset to 0%.
[[Heading:3]]Hypermatrix Pings[[/Heading]]
When Cogmind's core reaches below 33%, Cogmind will emit a hypermatrix ping and 6-8 Assembled will spawn next to Cogmind. This only happens on main [[0b10]] floors and in [[Command]]. After this, Cogmind will be able to detect further hypermatrix pings at a range of 18 tiles of other groups of assembled. Coming within a few tiles of these pings with visual contact will cause a further 6-8 Assembled to pop out.
[[Heading:3]]Memory Reset[[/Heading]]
Cogmind loses all map data, part IDs, [[Robot Analysis|Analyses]], [[Schematic|Schematics]], [[Data Conduit|Data Conduit intel]], [[RIF]] alliance, [[A7 Data Core|A7 Data Core intel]], and any manual [[Terminal]] or robot hacks. Notably, Cogmind will not lose [[FarCom]] or Imprint.
[[Heading:3]]Non-Alien Hostilities[[/Heading]]
Certain groups will no longer trust Cogmind as a result of using a CRM. If [[Zhirov]] shows up in [[Access]] as a result of completing the [[SGEMP Prototype]] quest, he and his allies will immediately turn hostile to Cogmind. [[Redacted]]The surrender option is no longer offered by [[MAIN.C]], causing the W8 [[Wintypes|Wintype]] to be unobtainable.[[/Redacted]]
[[Redacted]][[Heading:3]][[Sigix Exoskeleton]] Control[[/Heading]]
Cogmind is able to pilot the Exoskeleton located in [[Section 7]].[[/Redacted]]
[[Heading:3]]Unique Wintype[[/Heading]]
Taking a [[Surface]] exit after using a CRM awards the W2 wintype.

[[Heading]]Where to find[[/Heading]]
As an Alien Artifact, the CRM is only found in a few specific places:

"Corruption","Other","Corruption is a [[Game Mechanics|Gameplay Mechanic]] that can cause numerous negative effects on bots, up to instant death at 100% corruption. Corruption is an always visible stat in the HUD for Cogmind. Other bots can be [[Datajacks|Datajacked]] in order to see their corruption.

[[Heading]]Getting corruption[[/Heading]]
[[List]]Electromagnetic Damage: Between 50-150% of EM damage is also inflicted as corruption for non-Cogmind bots. For Cogmind, each hit has a [damage %] chance of inflicting 1% corruption.|
Impact Damage destroying parts: Each destroyed part inflicts between 25-150% corruption to non-Cogmind bots. For Cogmind, each destroyed part inflicts between 1-5% corruption.|
Getting hit by a Corruption Crit: Between 1-10% of the damage inflicted (including EM resistance but not other forms of damage reduction) is also inflicted as corruption. If the corruption inflicted is less than 0, it truncates to 0 rather than rounding up. For example, 5% of 10 damage would be .5% corruption, which truncates to 0.|
Attaching a [[Corrupted Parts|Corrupted Part]]: Between 1% and [corruption % on death / 10] corruption, capped at 15%.|
Feedback from being fully traced at an [[Interactive Machine]] (1%).[[/List]]
Note: All sources of corruption are affected by EM damage resistance.

[[Heading]]Corruption Effects[[/Heading]]
Some corruption effects can happen at any point in time, some only happen while hostiles are nearby, and some are permanent negative effects unless corruption is purged. Chance based corruption effects become more common at higher corruption.
[[Heading:2]]Cogmind Corruption Effects[[/Heading]]
[[Table]]
Name|Effect|Extra Conditions||
Message Error|Garbled messages appear in the game log.|N/A||
Matter Fused|Loss of between 5-10 [[Matter]], with the log message [[GameText]]System corrupted: Matter fused (-x).[[/GameText]]|Only occurs if Cogmind has > 0 matter||
Heat Flow Error|Large spike in [[Heat]], between 100 and 300, with log message [[GameText]]System corrupted: Heat flow error (+x).[[/GameText]]|N/A||
Energy Discharge|Loss of stored [[Energy]], between 20-40% of current storage capacity, with log message [[GameText]]System corrupted: Energy discharge (-x).[[/GameText]]|Only occurs if Cogmind has > 0 energy||
Part Rejected|A random part is detached, not including fragile parts like processors, with log message [[GameText]]System corrupted: [part name] rejected.[[/GameText]]|Only occurs while hostile bots are nearby||
Part Fused|A random part that isn't fragile or fused already becomes fused and is unable to be detached without destruction, with log message [[GameText]]System corrupted: [part name] fused.[[/GameText]]|N/A||
Data Loss (Minor/Major)|There are two similar effects of data loss. A minor data loss will lose 1-3 component part ID with the log message [[GameText]]System corrupted: Component data lost.[[/GameText]] A major data loss will lose 3-5 component part IDs with the log message [[GameText]]System corrupted: Substantial component data lost.[[/GameText]]|N/A||
Misfire|A random weapon will be attempted to be fired. Fails if the weapon does not have enough resources to fire (matter/energy). This effect doesn't affect melee weapons, special weapons, or guided weapons. Also has the log message [[GameText]]System corrupted: FCS attempts to trigger [part name].[[/GameText]] If the misfire is successful, there is an additional log message [[GameText]]System corrupted: [part name] misfires.[[/GameText]] Similarly to [[Autonomous Weapons]], This does not incur any time cost. Similarly to regular volleys, any heat generated is averaged over the time it would have taken to fire that weapon normally.|N/A||
IFF Burst|An IFF burst comes from Cogmind, alerting hostiles within a 15 tile radius. Bots will head to investigate the location of the IFF burst but do not gain active tracking on Cogmind. Also has the log message [[GameText]]IFF burst signal emitted.[[/GameText]]|N/A||
Misdirection|Cogmind may move in a random direction other than the one commanded, with game popup message (not log message) [[GameText]]System corrupted: Misdirected.[[/GameText]] On flight, may come with an additional penalty of slamming into a wall. If this occurs, Cogmind will take minor impact damage, with the log message [[GameText]]Slammed into [ceiling/wall].[[/GameText]]|Only occurs while hostile bots are nearby||
Weapon Failure|A weapon will fail to fire during a volley. Based on if the weapon is a ballistic weapon, energy weapon, or launcher, the log message will be the following: [[GameText]]System corrupted: [part name] jammed/failed to cycle/failed to launch.[[/GameText]]|Only occurs on firing a volley||
Hacking Penalty|Cogmind suffers a [corruption % / 3] penalty to the success rate of hacks on all interactive machines.|N/A||
Accuracy Penalty|Cogmind suffers a [corruption % / 4]% penalty to accuracy.|N/A||
Allied Trap Triggering|Can trigger allied traps when walking on top of them, with a [corruption %] chance of triggering.|N/A||
Instant Death|When Cogmind hits 100% corruption, the game is instantly over|>100% corruption 
[[/Table]]
[[Heading:2]]Non-Cogmind Corruption Effects[[/Heading]]
[[Table]]
Name|Effect||
Memory Loss|Typically, each action subtracts 1 from a bot's memory memory while it is out of line of sight of a target they are tracking. Bots have an additional penalty applied to their memory that is calculated as [corruption % / 10]. For example, a [[G-34 Mercenary]] at 0% corruption has a memory of 20 actions. At 10% corruption, this is reduced to 10 actions (20 / 2). At 20%, this is reduced to 7 (20 / 3, rounding up).||
Accuracy Penalty|Bots suffers a [corruption % / 8]% penalty to accuracy.||
Misfire|Bots will shoot something that wasn't intentionally aimed at. Unlike Cogmind misfires, this can only occur while a bot is actively shooting and all weapons in one volley will fire at the same target. When a bot shoots a non-bot target, there is a log message [[GameText]][bot name] misfires.[[/GameText]] If another bot is targeted, there is a different log message [[GameText]][bot name] IFF system glitched.[[/GameText]]||
Allied Trap Triggering|Can trigger allied traps when walking on top of them, with a [corruption %] chance of triggering.||
Instant Death|When a non-Cogmind bot hits 100% corruption, they will die at the end of their next turn[[/Table]]

"Coupling Squad","Other","[[Image]]Coupling Squad.png|A Programmer installing Relay Couplers into a Garrison[[/Image]]
Coupling squads are [[0b10]] aligned [[Squad|squads]] that are sent to restock [[Garrison Access|Garrison Machines]] with [[Relay Couplers]]. They can appear on any 0b10 floor that contains a Garrison as well as on the inside of [[Garrison|Garrisons]]. They consist of a single [[Programmer]] carrying 3-4 Relay Couplers. The Programmer is 1 tier above typical Programmers for the depth. For example, a typical -7 Programmer is a [[P-60 Hacker]], but a coupling squad will instead be a [[P-70 Sage]].
Coupling squads are dispatched if a Garrison has no Relay Couplers in its builtin inventory. Garrison machines usually contain 3-4 Couplers at all times, but sometimes one will be present on initial map entry with none. Full Garrisons will also lose their inventory over time and become empty. In either case, a Programmer will eventually be called to that Garrison to restock the Couplers. When a coupling squad Programmer reaches its target Garrison, a message like [[GameText]]P-70 Sage installs Relay Coupler [Grunt] into garrison access.[[/GameText]] will appear in the log. After all the couplers are installed, the Programmer will exit through the Garrison.

[[Heading]]Intentional dispatching[[/Heading]]
Coupling squads can also dispatched if Cogmind uses the [[Spoiler]]Trojan(Restock)[[/Spoiler]] hack. If this is done, log text similar to [[GameText]]ALERT: Unscheduled coupler replacement inbound for Garrison vPm.7n.[[/GameText]] will appear after a few turns. A similar restock effect will occur if Cogmind uses the [[Spoiler]]Force(Eject)[[/Spoiler]] hack.","","","","","","",""
"Critical Hits","Other","Critical hits (crits) are effects that have a chance to trigger on any successful hit. The chance and the specific effect depends on the weapon.

[[Heading]]Improving Critical Chance[[/Heading]]
There are several ways to improve critical chance:

Simply using more weapons, which increases the chance that a given volley will include a critical hit.
|Equipping [[Target Analyzers]], which increase each weapon's critical chance, though this does not affect the Meltdown critical or provide critical effects to weapons that do not have them already.
|Using weapons with higher critical chances, such as [[Hyp. Weapons]]. (But weapons that specialize in critical hits generally do less raw damage.)[[/List]]","","","","","","",""

"Cutter","Bot Group","Cutters are a [[Bot Groups|Bot Group]] of [[Flight Units|flying]] [[0b10]] combat robots that are most often seen in [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcement Squads]] after being summoned by [[Heavy|Heavies]] against flying or hovering bots. Armed with a Saw and Concussive RPG, these units will firstly fire their single-use RPG at the enemy and overload to try and sever the enemy's parts with their Saw. They will overload as soon as they are alerted to any hostile bot. They are harder to hit due to their small size and [[Reaction Control System|Reaction Control Systems]].
Cutters are a major nuisance at best, and a run ender for an airborne build at worst. Their ability to overload makes outrunning them nearly impossible in the long run, even for flight builds. This is even more challenging when their Saws sever essential parts off of Cogmind's body with a single hit, forcing Cogmind to either give up that part or waste essential turns re-attaching parts. The best strategy to kill them is typically a point blank explosive [[Launchers|Launcher]] to the face, as they have high core exposure and low core integrity. Launchering a nearby wall also helps to work around their high evasion. Explosive machine arrays are especially good at dispatching a group of Cutters since they can't miss. A [[Graphene Brace]] removes their sever capability and can make encounters with them much easier for combat builds.

"DSF","Location","DSF (Distributed Storage Facility) is a [[0b10]]-controlled sub-floor in [[Factory]] and [[Research]] branches that appears in all depths from -7 through -2. It can only be entered by hacking open a DSF entrance terminal (base 50% chance) without being spotted by any hostiles on the map. DSFs contain large amounts of non-[[Prototype Part|Prototype]] parts in groups of 2-6 that can be any part that can normally appear on the ground for the given depth. Unlike most maps, the ambient temperature in DSFs is -10 rather than 0. This has the effect of giving an additional 10 heat dissipation per turn to all bots on the map.
The overall map layout is semi-fixed. It consists of 2-4 quadrants connected by 2-tile wide corridors In the corner of each quadrant are large Matter Repository machines that will release [[Matter]] when broken. These corridors can have [[Alarm Trap|Alarm Traps]] and [[Stasis Trap|Stasis Traps]] in them but not in the item stockpiles. The exit will never be in the quadrant that Cogmind starts in. In the center of every DSF is a depth-appropriate [[Heavy]], guarding all of the main corridors in the map. Around the Heavy are 4 unpowered [[A-15 Conveyor|A-15 Conveyors]]. The corners of the map can have individual dormant [[Specialist|Specialists]], but not always. There are sometimes groups of 4 prototypes hidden behind emergency access doors in the center of a quadrant, and these prototypes will typically be out-of-depth. Sometimes there is a [[Sentry]] guarding this prototype stockpile.
[[Lore]]0b10 Records|DSF[[/Lore]]

[[Heading]]Mechanics[[/Heading]]
The Heavy in the center of the map makes nearly the entire map relatively unsafe. Although there are no patrols initially, walking through the DSF will quickly get some standard Heavy [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcements]] called on Cogmind. These reinforcements behave no differently than an normal map.
[[Heading:2]]Additional Patrols[[/Heading]]On top of the standard Heavy reinforcements, there are other ways to summon additional patrols. These patrols come in the form of 3 [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]] carrying other bots inside, spaced roughly 80 turns apart. These patrols will come one at a time and remain on the map permanently unless destroyed. These additional patrols can be summoned in one of 3 ways:
[[List]]The Heavy summoning reinforcements: When Cogmind is detected via the Heavy's active scanning, additional patrols will be summoned shortly after.|Terrain destruction: Patrols will be summoned if any of the walls of the DSF are destroyed by any means.|Alarm trap: Patrols will be summoned if an alarm trap is triggered and not jammed using a [[Transmission Jammer]].[[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]Rapid Sterilization[[/Heading]]
After killing around 10 hostiles on the map, rapid sterilization will be engaged. 20 turns after this announcement the ambient heat will rise by 10 and continue to raise by another 10 every 15 turns. This will happen until Cogmind exits the map. This also enables the [[Encrypted Comm Array]] to spawn in the next [[Caves]] if Cogmind does not have a conflicting faction.

[[List]](++) Derelict assault group on entry: A group of [[Derelict|Derelicts]] are present on entering the map next to Cogmind. These bots will charge the center of the map, try to kill the heavy, and continue on toward the exit. If any Derelicts survive, they will continue through the exit and show up on the next map.|(++) Derelict assault enters after Cogmind: Similar to the previous event, bots will trickle one at a time onto the map and then wander around the map instead of heading directly toward the exit.|(++) Derelict assault in progress: A much larger Derelict attack force fights a large number of 0b10 bots. This can include prototype 0b10 and Warlord bots, such as [[Striker|Strikers]] and [[Hydra|Hydras]].|(~) Sapper sabotage: 2 [[Sapper|Sappers]] will appear at the start of the map with lots of [[Sapper Charge|Sapper Charges]] on the ground. Large explosions will follow the 2 bots through the map as they head for the exit. For slower propulsion types, do not slow down or else the high damage explosions will reach you.|(~) [[Assembled (4)|Assembled]] infestation: Assembled will appear behind the emergency access doors with a cache of prototype items and roam around the map. They will continue to spawn in greater waves and attack everything in sight. Up to two [[Demolisher]] response squads will be summoned to deal with them.|(~) Wild Derelict Assault: Wild (and hostile) cave Derelicts will attack the DSF from the exit and roam around the map. They will attack 0b10 and Cogmind-allied bots alike.[[/List]]

[[Heading]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There is only one exit in each DSF. Most of the time the exit leads to the next main floor, although it can occasionally lead into a [[Garrison]] on the current depth. If leading to a Garrison, the Garrison exit will not loop back to the same depth again.","","","","","","",""

"Data Miner (Location)","Location","The Data Miner location is a [[Caves]] [[Branch]] that appears on either -7 or -6 and is home to the eponymous bot the [[Data Miner]] aka DM. There are no initially hostile bots, but if Data Miner is attacked, the Data Conduit machine is broken, or Cogmind installs a trap, he will trigger a trap door to leave the map and 4 dormant [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]] hidden in the walls will wake up and become hostile. If you have any [[Corruption]], make sure to detach all ranged weapons to avoid accidental misfires.
There are 4 unique Terminals on the bottom side of the map. The left 2 contain mostly lore records, although the top-left Terminal will also list the depth of [[Section 7]] as well as the access code to the [[Warlord (Location)|Warlord]] Prototype Stash. These two vary per run so make sure to grab these lore entries every time. The bottom ones do not contain any additional information each run. The top-right Terminal will contain several random bot [[Schematic|Schematics]] and the bottom-right Terminal will contain a large number of part schematics and a few Prototype ID Banks. The part schematics will always contain schematics for [[Combat Drone Bay]] and [[Lgt. Regenerative Plating]].

[[Heading]]Alignment[[/Heading]]
Talking with the Data Miner will result in a permanent alignment bonus that does not have any incompatibilities. [[Investigation Squad|Investigations]] and [[Assault Squad|Assaults]] on all [[0b10]]-controlled floors have a 50% chance to be redirected to another random place on the map if Cogmind is determined as needing assistance. For Assaults, this will result in their permanent repositioning. This is a benefit most of the time, although on cramped maps it can be a downside because bots can be grouped together at chokepoints. However, this effect can only occur if Cogmind's build is in a generally poor state. Additionally, several door terminals will automatically open with the Log message [[GameText]]Door Terminal flashes as you approach.[[/GameText]] This will happen at all of the locked cells in [[Extension]] as well as locked entrance Terminal prefabs to Extension, [[Quarantine]], and all 3 [[Command]] entrance Terminals.
[[Heading:2]]Data Conduit[[/Heading]]
There is a second secret alignment to this map. After the Data Miner is attacked and either destroyed or trap-doored off the map it is possible to step into and use his Data Conduit machine. Doing so will provide many benefits and some major penalties. The rewards are:
[[List]]All obtainable analyses in the game|All [[Prototype Part|Prototype]] IDs|All interactive and non-interactive machine intel|[[Redacted]]The ability to decrypt the [[Lab]] Terminal and see the Lab scanner tiles[[/Redacted]]|[[Redacted]]Manual bot hacking [[Datajacks|Datajack]] codes that can be used to destroy all ""A"" bots on sight[[/Redacted]][[/List]]
The downsides are:
[[List]][[Intercept Squad|Intercepts]] will be dispatched on most 0b10-controlled floors|No more [[Enhanced Grunt]] backup when turning [[Warlord]] hostile on the -2 [[Research]] assault|The group of disabled [[Grunt|Grunts]] in [[Armory]] will turn hostile rather than friendly when awakened|[[Redacted]][[Enhanced Programmer|Enhanced Programmers]] will appear in [[Access_0]][[/Redacted]][[/List]]
The upsides are quite strong but the downsides are very deadly to all but the most prepared Cogmind. [[Tracker|Trackers]] can easily chew up any airborne build with their deadly [[Immobilizer]] to halt any chance of escape with their highly accurate [[Linked Autogun]] to put out the damage. Adequately prepared combat builds can usually dispatch the Trackers without too much trouble and use their Linked Autoguns to great effect. Each Tracker will also summon a [[Combat Programmer]] which is a high-damaging foe that will quickly rack up corruption. Unlike [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]], Intercepts are move-based and not time-based and tends to punish airborne builds relatively more than combat builds. When using the Data Conduit, Cogmind should either be prepared to exit maps quickly to avoid Intercept encounters or have a plan to fight.

[[Heading]]Fighting[[/Heading]]
Killing the Data Miner himself is highly luck based with only a few ways to improve the chances. A successful Data Miner kill can yield up to 4 pieces of Prototype Hackware at an early depth. Ranged weapons are almost entirely out of the question because he will escape after the first weapon in a volley. However, melee weapon follow-ups will not cause the trap door to activate in between the volley. The primary ways to increase kill chance are to:
[[List]]Use as many weapon slots with melee weapons as possible|Use [[Actuator Arrays]] to increase followup chance|Use [[Core Analyzers]] to increase core hit chance|Use [[Momentum]] to increase damage|Use [[Force Boosters]] to increase damage[[/List]]
[[Heading:2]][[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]][[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Data Miner Combat Dig.png|Digging through the Data Conduit to fight Grunts[[/Image]]
After the Data Miner is attacked these grunts hidden in the wall will burst out and become aggressive. These Grunts have some nice loot for the depth, particularly their [[Neutron Cannon]], [[Adv. Energy Well]], [[Adv. Particle Charger]], and [[Enh. Flexi-carbon Leg|Enh. Flexi-carbon Legs]]. There are several good ways to dispatch these Grunts:
[[Image]]Data Miner Escape Dig.png|Digging through the Data Conduit to escape[[/Image]]
[[List]]Use 2 or more [[Launchers]] and fight them all at once. Explosive launchers will be slower and provide little to no loot but can have a nice range advantage over the Grunts' below average 14 range. EM launchers have a smaller range but will provide a decent amount of loot, although it will be [[Corrupted Parts|Corrupted]].|Dig a tunnel deep into the Data Conduit machine and hide out inside. The Grunts will spread out over time and you can lure them in to fight 1-on-1. This approach works best with some kind of [[Transmission Jammers|Transmission Jammer]] to avoid drawing more than one Grunt at a time. This is the best tactic to fight Grunts with melee or conventional non-launcher methods.[[/List]]
Another approach is to simply run from the Grunts. This works best for airborne builds as they can get in and out with the fewest number of shots. Digging a tunnel through the Data Conduit machine is also very helpful for escaping. Luring the Grunts into a tunnel as you escape out the other end can avoid most attacks. Flight can hop over the grouped-up Grunts and dodge into the spawn areas to avoid more shots","Spoiler","","","","","",""

[[Heading]]Effect[[/Heading]]
Attaching a Dimensional Node Initializer consumes it and deploys a Slip Node a Cogmind's current location, unless currently standing on a non-broken door-type tile, a [[Traps|Trap]], or certain rare and seemingly random tiles, in which case a Dimensional Node Initializer does not do anything and is instead detached and dropped on the ground.
While Slip Nodes can be deployed onto dug-out tiles and broken doors, this is not recommended, as [[U-05 Engineer|U-05 Engineers]] repairing walls or doors when a Slip Node currently occupies the tile will remove the Slip Node from existence. Also be wary of Engineers building machinery, as this can also overwrite the Slip Node tile.

[[Heading]]Slip Node effects[[/Heading]]
Slip Nodes function as a way to control the destination of [[Transdimensional Reconstructors]], which always target the nearest active Slip Node, regardless of the distance limitations of Transdimensional Reconstructors.

Slip Nodes are a unique type of explosive machinery. Unlike all other explosive machinery, they do not hinder movement or vision, though they will still block projectiles like regular machinery. They have 20 armor, and if destroyed will implode for 500 explosive damage with a radius of 5, a falloff of -50, 2-3 chunks, and high negative salvage.

If a robot is standing on a Slip Node, all non-penetrating non-explosive attacks on that robot will hit the Slip Node instead. Some of the robots incapable of destroying Slip Nodes (and therefore incapable of damaging any robots on one) include the [[G-47 Trooper]], [[S-27 Virus]], [[Y-54 Guardian]], [[X-57 Shotgunner]], [[X-77 Beamer]], [[X-82 Rainmaker]], and most notably [[Master Thief|Master Thieves]].

[[Heading]]Uses[[/Heading]]
Dimensional Node Initializers have multiple possible uses. In all cases, though, be wary of potential misfires due to [[Corruption]], which could easily implode the Slip Node. Some uses include:
[[List]]
Controlled Teleportation - By deploying a Slip Node somewhere, it is possible to later use a Transdimensional Reconstructor to teleport back to it, to for example escape a dangerous area.
Due to how easily Slip Nodes can implode when hit, however, it is best to deploy them somewhere where they are unlikely to be damaged, away from any allies, AOE traps, and if within the [[0b10]] Complex, preferably [[Spoiler]]in a room containing a [[Terminal]] with Trojan(Track) installed[[/Spoiler]]. Otherwise, there is a risk of teleporting while a group of hostiles passes by, which would then likely blow up the Slip Node, dealing high damage to Cogmind.

|Pursuer anti-tracking - Because teleportation causes all pursuers to lose tracking on Cogmind, an effective way to lose pursuers is turning around a corner or going into a room, then deploying a Slip Node and using a Transdimensional Reconstructor. This grants the benefits of losing pursuers without the drawback of possibly teleporting somewhere hazardous. Best done in places with no unknown AOE traps.
|Makeshift bomb - Due to causing highly damaging explosions, Slip Nodes can be used as a way to deal very high damage, either to break nearly any [[Reinforced Walls|Reinforced Walls or Barriers]], or to damage hostiles. Multiple Slip Nodes can be deployed next to each other to cause extremely high damage in a single attack (exercise extreme caution when deploying multiple Slip Nodes next to one another, as you do not want them to all explode on you).
|[[Spoiler]]One-time Master Thief shield - Because Master Thieves are incapable of destroying Slip Nodes, standing on a Slip Node renders Cogmind immune to Master Thieves, making it possible to easily destroy them.
Due to how easily Slip Nodes can implode, however, doing this risk-free requires that Cogmind have no allies using ranged weapons that might miss and destroy the Slip Node (melee allies are safe), that there would not be any other hostiles capable of destroying Slip Nodes, that there would be no [[Dirty Bomb Trap|Dirty Bomb Traps]] the Master Thieves could activate, and that Cogmind would not be using any weapon capable of causing explosions (no [[Launchers]], no [[Firepult]], [[YOLO Cannon]], [[Throwing Claymores]], [[Plasma Storm]] or [[Voltaic Drivehammer]], no [[Electromagnetic Weapons]], and no [[Neutron Cannon]] or [[Hvy. Neutron Cannon]]).
This also does not work on regular [[Thief|Thieves]], as their [[Tearclaws]] are capable of destroying Slip Nodes.[[/Spoiler]]

"Dirty Bomb Trap","Part","Dirty Bomb Traps are explosive EM [[Traps]] made and used by [[Derelict|Derelicts]] to defend areas or spring ambushes on [[0b10]] forces. The EM explosions caused by these traps are very likely to cause nearby Traps, including other Dirty Bomb Traps, to also trigger. These Traps are most commonly found in [[Caves]] and [[Warlord (Location)]] and are friendly to Cogmind unless one was reprogrammed by a [[Minesweeper]] that was interrupted before it could extract it, or if [[Spoiler]]Cogmind antagonizes Warlord (Location), which will cause all derelict traps on that map to also turn hostile.[[/Spoiler]]

[[Heading]]How to obtain[[/Heading]]
There are three main ways of acquiring Dirty Bomb Traps for personal use:
[[List]]Obtaining Derelict-made ones by extracting them using a [[Trap Extractors|Trap Extractor]] (since they are friendly, they don't need to be reprogrammed beforehand) or letting a Minesweeper extract them for you.
|[[Spoiler]]Fabricating them using a [[Bomb Factory No. 2]].[[/Spoiler]]
|[[Spoiler]]Obtaining the schematic through a [[Tech Extrapolator]] by seeing a [[Heavy Explosive Trap]], a [[Tesla Bomb Launcher]] and a [[Hvy. Missile Launcher]], then hacking [[Fabricator|Fabricators]] to fabricate them. [[Comment]]Since there are no [[Authchips]] for traps/inventory items, i don't think it's possible to fabricate ""safely"", but i haven't checked if there isn't some authchip type that somehow works for traps, so i'm not sure.[[/Comment]][[/Spoiler]]

[[/List]]

[[Heading]]Strategy[[/Heading]]
There are many ways to use Dirty Bomb Traps effectively. Some ways include:
[[List]]They can be used to corrupt pursuers to cause them to lose track of Cogmind sooner.
|They can be sneakily placed near a defended location in preparation for an attack, such as one of the many [[Caves#outposts|0b10 Caves outposts]].
|They can be placed on the paths of 0b10 squads to destroy or at least seriously damage them without even fighting them. When using multiple traps that way, it is usually better to place them around the squad's path in a sort of V-shape pointed in the direction the squad is going towards, so that one of the squad leader's followers moving on the side would trigger a Dirty Bomb Trap, causing all other traps to also explode while the majority of the squad is standing in the center of the Traps.

"Duelist","Bot Group","Duelists are a [[Bot Groups|Bot Group]] of [[Legs|legged]] [[0b10]] combat bots armed with a [[Slashing Weapons|Slashing Weapon]] that can sever off important parts. While they can only attack at short range, they are frightening to face up close with their [[Melee Analysis Suites]] and [[Actuators]] allowing them to hit hard and fast. They also have [[Core Shieldings|Core Shielding]] which makes them immune to direct critical hits and a bit more survivable.
Duelists don't have any particular damage type weaknesses, though their biggest weakness is [[Ballistic Cannons]] because the knockback will help keep a them out of melee range. Other than that, any non-melee weapon is good to use against Duelists. Using melee against them is a little more dangerous since that means Cogmind hast to go toe-to-toe with their strong melee loadout. Melee is a worse idea because of their innate minor slashing/piercing resistances.

"Encrypted Comm Array","Part","The Encrypted Comm Array, or ECA, is a [[Warlord]]-aligned item that enables summoning various groups of [[Derelict]] allies on main [[0b10]] floors. It can be obtained by performing any of the actions that increase the ECA force multiplier listed below. After this, a Derelict will appear in the next [[Caves]] map and deliver the Array, give some more details on its usage, and reveal the depth of [[Warlord (Location)]]. The ECA cannot be used if Cogmind has been [[Imprint|Imprinted]] or made use of a [[RIF|RIF installer]], as these alignments are mutually exclusive with Warlord.

[[Heading]]Summoning squads[[/Heading]]
Equipping the ECA on any main 0b10 floor will reveal up to 8 squads available for summoning. Each time a squad is summoned, the force multiplier is decreased by 0.01. Moving over one of the squad indicators on the map will summon several white colored [[Alert]]-free allies that will follow Cogmind around the map, but will not follow to any other maps. These bots also do not gain trap location knowledge from Cogmind like purple or blue allies, so they may move over known traps. The squads do not get stronger as depth increases, so they have less utility in late [[Factory]] and [[Research]] depths. All squads have a chance of containing a [[Surgeon]] that will repair any allied bots as well as Cogmind. The available squads are:
[[List]]Chimera Squad: [[Mutant|Mutants]]|Dakka Squad: [[Wasp|Wasps]]|Muscle Squad: [[Butcher|Butchers]] and [[Savage|Savages]]|Geek Squad: [[Wizard|Wizards]]|Ghost Squad: [[Infiltrator|Infiltrators]]|Infantry Squad: [[Thug|Thugs]]|Pyro Squad: [[Fireman|Firemen]]|Ranger Squad: [[Guerrilla|Guerrillas]][[/List]]
If Cogmind meets Warlord at his base, the squad summoning and force multiplier reporting mechanics stop functioning, and there is no point to hold onto the ECA any longer.

[[Heading]]Force multiplier[[/Heading]]
The ECA brings an additional mechanic to Warlord alignment called the force multiplier. This value is reported every time Cogmind enters a new main 0b10 depth. The force multiplier affects several things:
[[List]]The total number of squads available to summon per map. This starts at 0 squads at a 1.00 force multiplier and caps at 8 at 1.08.|Special guard squads in the -2 [[Research]] Warlord assault event. Based on the performance tier, more bots and stronger squads can be summoned to aid Cogmind during the assault.|-1 [[Access]] spillover forces: In Access, additional Warlord forces will appear at the entrance to the map. More squads will appear with a higher force multiplier.|[[Redacted]]The [[Command]] seals will summon more and stronger bots based on the overall force multiplier.[[/Redacted]][[/List]]
The force multiplier tiers are as follows:
[[List]]D: 1.00 - 1.09|C: 1.10 - 1.19|B: 1.20 - 1.29|A: 1.30 - 1.39|S: 1.40+[[/List]]
The following are the ways that the force multiplier can be modified:
[[Table]]
Method|Effect||
Sterilizing a DSF|+ 0.10||
Garrison interior compromised (once per Garrison)|+ 0.02||
Destroying a RIF installer|+ 0.02||
Destroying a Garrison Relay|+ 0.01||
Destroying a [[Phase Generator]]|+ 0.01||
Summoning an ECA squad|- 0.01||
Ascending a depth|- 0.01
[[/Table]]

[[Heading]]Additional abilities[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:2]][[Infiltrator]] Conversion[[/Heading]]
The ECA has a unique ability that interacts with [[Heavy]]-summoned [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcement Squads]]. Occasionally, [[Specialist|Specialists]] summoned by the Heavy will reveal themselves to be Infiltrators in disguise and turn friendly to Cogmind.
[[Heading:2]]Friendly [[Ambush Trap]] detection[[/Heading]]
The Encrypted Comm Array will detect and reveal friendly ambush traps. When this happens, there will be a log message [[GameText]]Comm Array decrypts allied signals from nearby ambush traps.[[/GameText]]

[[Heading]]Post-Warlord RIF[[/Heading]]
It is possible to install RIF after meeting Warlord. Warlord and his forces will not turn against Cogmind at this point, as they can only detect RIF inside of the Warlord base. However, doing so will lose some of the benefits. The -2 special guards will not appear based on the force multiplier. [[Redacted]]Additionally, fewer squads will be dispatched to follow Cogmind around from the Command seals. However, the seals will still have a higher number and more powerful bots based on the force multiplier as usual.[[/Redacted]]","","","","","","",""

"Executioner","Bot","Executioners are relatively dangerous prototype combat robots deployed most often in high security areas or to attack serious threats to the safety of the complex. They are most dangerous at their maximum range of 23-24 tiles due to most opponents being unable to return fire, but they don't aim through walls and once they are being attacked they are approximately as durable as a [[H-88 Terminator]]. Executioners are also made of a very high proportion of rare and generally useful parts to Cogmind such as their Exp. Core Analyzer, Imp. Quantum Reactor, Adv. Kinecellerator, and Enh. Biometal Legs, making them a worthwhile target to salvage for many builds.","","","","","","",""
"Exiles (Group)","Bot Group","The Exiles are a group of 3 [[Tinkerer]]-like bots and their bodyguard [[8R-AWN]] stationed at [[Exiles (Location)]] that have been exiled from [[Zion]].
[[EX-DEC]] wields their [[AWS/EX-DEC]] and [[8R-AWN]] wields 2 [[8R-AWN's Boregun|Boreguns]] and may fight if provoked, but the others are unarmed. They have developed a large number of unique prototype parts.","","8R-AWN,EX-BIN,EX-DEC,EX-HEX","","","","",""
"Exiles (Location)","Location","The Exiles map appears as a [[Branch]] off of [[Mines]] on either -10 or -9 and is home to the Exiles, a group of friendly Derelict Tinkerer outcasts made up of [[EX-BIN]], [[EX-DEC]], [[EX-HEX]], and their bodyguard [[8R-AWN]]. These Exiles have a large collection of unique prototype parts that are only available in the Exiles vault. The entrance is guarded by some rigged engines that blow up when a hostile bot crosses them. There are some lore terminals with entries written by each of the tinkerers that describe many of the prototype parts obtainable on this map as well as some that are not. The terminal near the center of the map also contains a log entry that points to the depth that [[Zion]] is on. Various caches of storage units and energy/matter storage can be found throughout the map. ""The Gauntlet"" at the bottom of the map is a stretch of tester bots that are working on the latest batch of prototype parts. These Derelicts have names that reference Cogmind community members. This map is also home to the [[FarCom]] aligner machine and a unique alignment.
Carrying a [[Datajack]] into this map can be a good idea due to all of the prototype parts that the Exiles and 8R-AWN have on them. Parsing them will provide the associated prototype part IDs so you can recognize the parts later.
Be wary of [[Corruption]] on this map. There is rarely any way to cleanse corruption this early in the game, and misfires are possible at even 1% corruption. One misfire hitting the wrong thing will result in the whole map turning aggressive and death will likely follow. Detaching all ranged weapons is recommended if Cogmind has any corruption.

[[Heading]]Alignment[[/Heading]]
Using the [[FarCom]] machine grants an 18-radius permanent combat hostile sensor in any [[0b10]] controlled maps and one of the special vault items. If FarCom abilities are retained, entering any [[Research]] branches will have massive consequences. Other than that, FarCom can provide some great advantages to help players with permanent itemless sensor abilities.
3 random items will be present in the vault in most games from the [[Exiles Vault Prototypes]] list. However, 3 [[Deploy-a-Sentry]] and 2 [[Potential Leg]] will appear instead of just one.
[[Heading:2]]Alignment Options[[/Heading]]
There are more ways to interact with FarCom without just taking a single vault item. Here are all of the outcomes:[[List]]Use FarCom machine, take 0-1 vault items: Permanently gain FarCom and the use of the vault item taken.|Use FarCom machine, take 2-3 vault items: Gain FarCom until [[Factory]] is reached. After that, the Exiles notice that you are a thief and will remove FarCom. [[Master Thief|Master Thieves]] will sometimes ambush you at the entrance/exits in [[Caves]] maps and rip parts off of your body and from your inventory. They will prioritize high rating parts and Exiles prototypes.|Use FarCom machine (or don't), attack Exiles and leave the map with 0 vault items: Lose FarCom instantly. The Exiles will become aggressive and send [[Assembled (4)|Assembled]], a [[DAS Turret]], and [[8R-AWN]] to kill you. After leaving the map, there is a chance that a hostile [[Z-Hero]] will spawn and attack you. Note: Using vault items on the map is safe as long as no items actually leave the map.|Use FarCom machine, attack Exiles and leave the map with 1 or more vault items: The same as above except you get Master Thieves in caves as described above.[[/List]]

[[Heading]]Variations[[/Heading]]
There are several variations of the Exiles map that can change things dramatically. In the majority of maps, the Exiles are present. However, there are 2 possible variations in the maps:
[[Image]]Exiles Attacked.png|Attacked Exiles vault[[/Image]][[List]]Abandoned Exiles: In this map, the Exiles have all fled the map and taken nearly everything on the map as well. Neither FarCom nor any vault items are obtainable in this seed. However, EX-DEC may be found in [[Spoiler]][[Warlord (Location)|Warlord]] in the Vortex Lab[[/Spoiler]] in these seeds.|Attacked Exiles: In this map, the Exiles have been attacked and are missing. There are disabled and rewirable bots on the map and random parts on the ground. FarCom is not obtainable on this seed, but one random vault prototype is available by using the manual code [[Spoiler]][[GameText]]\\\\1234[[/GameText]][[/Spoiler]] on the vault terminal.|While not changing the map in any way, there is a chance that a large [[0b10]] attack force will assault the Exiles base after using the FarCom machine and exiting the vault.[[/List]]

[[Heading]]Fighting[[/Heading]]
Fighting the Exiles is a challenging yet rewarding endeavor. Although they are normally friendly, they can pack quite a punch and will likely end the run of any unprepared player. As far as rewards go, [[8R-AWN]] has some powerful unique [[8R-AWN's Boregun|Boreguns]] with a high salvage and destroy critical %, out-of-depth parts including [[Exp. Heat Sink]], [[Adv. Weapon Cycler]], [[Exp. Targeting Computer]], and [[Adv. Myomer Leg]]. Another unique part, the [[AS-neutralizer No. 17b]] is very helpful in a later game branch [[Zion Deep Caves]]. Other useful parts on some of the Exiles themselves are [[Adv. Component Analysis Suite]], [[System Purifier]], [[Cmb. Antigrav System]], [[Imp. Armor Integrity Analyzer]], [[Exp. Core Analyzer]], and [[Adv. Transmission Jammer]].
[[Image]]Exiles Kill Build.png|Example Exiles kill build[[/Image]]
Fighting the Exiles is not recommended on -10 due to lower slot count, lower core integrity, and difficulty in getting enough integrity to survive the 8R-AWN fight. If fighting on -9, evolving a 3rd weapon slot can be very effective in killing 8R-AWN and any potential [[Z-Hero|Z-Heroes]] that might spawn in the next Mines map. The third weapon slot is not required to kill by any means, however, and any combination of weapon, utility, and propulsion slots for the evolve will work. As a basic checklist, the following parts are recommended:[[List]]Multiple kinetic guns with backups, ideally [[Hvy. Assault Rifle|Hvy. Assault Rifles]] or [[Imp. Assault Rifle|Imp. Assault Rifles]], weapons with negative salvage like [[Shotgun]] or a ballistic cannon like [[Imp. Light Cannon]] can work but 8R-AWN has very strong loot that is nice to get if possible|Multiple pieces of armor, preferably [[Hrd. Light Armor Plating]] or [[Med. Armor Plating]]|Multiple [[Lgt. Treads]] or [[Imp. Treads]] with backups|At least one launcher like [[Grenade Launcher]], [[Mni. Grenade Launcher]], or [[Rocket Launcher]]|(Optional) A way to gain positive salvage like a [[Salvage Targeting Computer]] can provide a better chance at part drops|(Optional) [[Blade Trap|Blade Traps]] for 8R-AWN, if an early trap extractor or trap stockpile are found in Mines. IMPORTANT: Do not install more than one trap until after the attack has begun. Exiles will give a warning if a trap is installed, and immediately turn on Cogmind if a second is installed.|(Optional) [[Thief Drone Bay]] trivializes the 8R-AWN fight. Make sure that you have aggro (he is shooting you), then release the drones. They will rip off parts very quickly and leave them defenseless.[[/List]]
[[Image]]Exiles Kill.png|A visual guide to killing the Exiles[[/Image]]
There are some things that should be done before actually doing the fight itself. The image on the right serves as a visual reference. Any rigged engines used must be in inventory before attacking the Exiles, otherwise the engines will still remain loyal to the Exiles and explode only on Cogmind. Matter pods should be relocated near the 8R-AWN fighting spot (See point #4 in diagram) to avoid running out of matter in combat. Any allies should be told to stay in the same general area so they can contribute to the fight. However, Grunts can't deal much damage until [[8R-AWN's Armor/TH]] is destroyed. Finally, some vault items may come in handy for the fight. The [[Cloak of Protection]]'s effect is not so strong, but when turned off it is a high coverage high integrity piece of armor. The [[Longsword +1]] is a very effective kill tool. The [[Potential Leg|Potential Legs]] have a lot of integrity in case you run out of propulsion during the fight. The [[Gui. Plasma Cannon]] may be used to safely destroy the [[DAS Turret]] without getting attacked back. One thing to consider about the vault is that there may be a 0b10 attack on the Exiles after exiting. In those cases, an Exiles kill may either have to be cancelled or at least turned into a 8R-AWN only kill. Aside from that, the fight may begin:
[[Image]]Exiles Launcher DAS.png|Launchering the DAS turret[[/Image]]
[[List:Ordered]]Shoot one of the spike-shaped machines to turn the Exiles hostile.|Drop the rigged engines from the entrance every few tiles while walking toward the spot for step #3, they have an explosion radius of 2. This will take care of most of the Assembled that are coming your way. IMPORTANT: This must be done after the Exiles become hostile. If you do it before that, they will explode on Cogmind.|Pull out a Launcher and dispose of the remaining Assembled.|Go to the corner to fight 8R-AWN. If you have any blade traps, now is the time to use them. Place them just above the bottom-most wall to the right of the spot marked 4. This is the part that needs the most backups, as 8R-AWN will destroy many of your parts very quickly due to high damage and high part destroy critical chance. Always put on backup parts right away after they are destroyed.You may run out of matter and have to refill from matter pods at this point, which is why preemptively moving the matter pods here can be very important. Many kill attempts that don't have enough damage or integrity will end here.|Hopefully you have some good loot after 8R-AWN is destroyed. [[8R-AWN's Boregun|Boreguns]] are a very easy way to destroy the [[DAS Turret]]. Penetrate through the machines to try and kill the turret without getting shot at because the cannon deals incredibly high damage. If no Boreguns were dropped, using a launcher is another good option. The idea is to aim around the spike in the machine so that you can't get hit but the explosion radius will still hit the turret.|Finally, all that is left is to loot the Exiles and their Derelict friends. Otherwise just finish them off with whatever you have left. Watch out for [[EX-DEC]] as they have a deadly [[AWS/EX-DEC]] that can deal a lot of damage very quickly if you aren't careful. It has a short range, so just take them out from a distance.[[/List]]","","","","","","",""

"Extension","Location","Extension is an [[0b10]]-controlled [[Factory]] [[Branch]] that appears between -6 and -4 and serves as a connection between the main [[0b10]] complex and [[Cetus]]. It is the beginning of a 4-map sequences of branches that spans Extension, Cetus, [[Archives]], and [[Hub_04(d)]]. It is an 0b10-controlled map with a small amount of patrols and moderate amount of guards spread throughout. There are a large amount of non-combat hostiles moving in between [[Transfer Station|Transfer Stations]] at the left and right-most parts of the map. Unlike most 0b10-controlled maps, [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]] will not spawn in Extension. The central area is heavily guarded with 2 [[Behemoth|Behemoths]] and 2 [[Sentry|Sentries]] standing by.
The overall map shape is similar to a large B turned on its side. This map shape is the same between runs, although every map has random contents. There is a single bottom path that runs straight to the main Factory/Cetus exits and 2 branching paths that contain some machines and disabled and imprisoned [[Derelict|Derelicts]]. One special NPC, [[A7]], is guaranteed to be locked in one of the cells. The central area has the aforementioned guards stationed as well as a [[Terminal]]-locked exit. The bottom path to either side of the central area can have Emergency Access doors along the top or bottom of the path. These can contain hostile guards, part caches, or nothing.
One unique mechanic to Extension is the persistent threat check. If too many non-combat hostiles are attacked and destroyed, an alert with the text [[GameText]]ALERT: Persistent threat to transfer network, dispatching additional forces.[[/GameText]] will appear, and 2 [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]] will be dispatched to patrol the map.
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
There are two types of special machines in Extension. The first, the Transfer Station, is a machine that normally transports non-combat hostiles. When destroyed, each one will reduce the number of non-combat robots on all 0b10-controlled maps by a stacking 50% amount. Note that this does not include [[Researcher|Researchers]]. The other, Energy Cyclers, will open all Sealed Heavy Doors simultaneously when destroyed and summon several ARCs to patrol the map. This will free all of the locked up Derelicts and they will start heading in Cogmind's direction, fighting every hostile they see. Destroying either of these machines can be either good or bad, although the energy cycler effect is almost always bad.

There are 3 exits, 2 of which right next to each other. The exit in the center of the map leads to the next main floor, either Factory or Research.

"Extermination Squad","Other","[[Image]]Extermination Squad.png|An Extermination Squad hunting down Cogmind[[/Image]]
Extermination squads are [[0b10]] aligned [[Squad|squads]] that are sent after Cogmind periodically in [[Factory]] (-7) and beyond. Exterminations are sent to the area that Cogmind was located at when they are summoned. Once they arrive there, they will begin a search pattern that steadily grows in range over time until they find Cogmind. Extermination squads consist of 1-3 [[Programmer|Programmers]] based on the floor: 1 [[P-60 Hacker]] on -7 and -6, 1 or 2 [[P-70 Sage|P-70 Sages]] on -5 and -4, and 2 or 3 [[P-80 Master|P-80 Masters]] on -3 to -1. Extermination squads can be both Enumerated and Recalled at [[Terminal|Terminals]].
An alert will indicate whenever an an Extermination squad is dispatched. Additionally, the log will display a message like [[GameText]]ALERT: Rogue bot located, Programmers report to Factory Zone 5B.[[/GameText]]

[[Heading]]Frequency[[/Heading]]
Extermination squads are dispatched on a regular basis on most 0b10 maps past -7. The higher the depth, the more frequently that Exterminations will be dispatched.
The spawn frequency can be delayed with [[Spoiler]]the [[RIF]] ability Zone Cloak[[/Spoiler]] or by sealing [[Garrison Access|Garrison Machines]]. Both of these methods stack, and each provides an average of +75 turns to each Extermination squad spawn.

It is possible for Extermination Programmers to be replaced by 1-2 Q-Series instead. This can occur randomly if Cogmind gets scanned by a [[Researcher]] in [[Testing]] or [[Quarantine]]. These Q-Series have customized and randomized loadouts, but will behave in the same way as regular Extermination squads do. This includes heading for Cogmind's initial position and then continuing to search for Cogmind as well as the ability to be recalled at Terminals. However, unlike Exterminations, Q-Series have a [[Lrn. IFF Parser]] that they can use to locate Cogmind from a large distance.[[/Spoiler]]","","","","","","",""

"Fabricator","Other","[[Image]]../game_sprites/Fabricator.png|A Fabricator[[/Image]]
Fabricators are [[0b10]]-controlled [[Interactive Machine|Machines]] that construct parts and robots based on [[Schematic|Schematics]]. Cogmind can make use of Fabricators, but bots may be called to investigate if an unauthorized schematic is used. At other times, 0b10 will use them to fabricate random parts and combat bots for itself. Some parts and most bots fabricate in larger groups. Fabricators do not appear until -7 [[Factory]], at which point they will appear in every main 0b10 floor as well as [[Testing]].

[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]
[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Fabricator[[/Lore]]

[[Heading]]Fabricating Things[[/Heading]]There are three primary ways that parts and bots can be fabricated.

[[Heading:2]]Initiated by 0b10[[/Heading]]
0b10 will periodically make use of Fabricators. Combat bots that are fabricated will be sent to the nearest [[Garrison Access|Garrison]]. Part fabrication initiated by 0b10 will fabricate double the standard amount of parts. Parts fabricated by 0b10 can be up to 2 ratings out of depth.

[[Heading:2]]Preloaded Schematic[[/Heading]]
Schematics can be preloaded into the fabricator without their fabrication having started yet. In this case, Cogmind can initiate the fabrication without any other requirements or downsides. The schematic will be instantly cleared when fabrication begins. Schematics preloaded this way can be up to 3 ratings out of depth.[[Comment]]In Beta 15, in -7/Factory, seed CommTrapBeamcaster, the Fabricator literally next to the starting point has a preloaded Mni. Smartbomb Launcher, which is rating 6*.[[/Comment]]

[[Heading:2]]Cogmind Loaded Schematic[[/Heading]]
Cogmind can load any known part or bot schematic into the Fabricator. When a fabrication is initiated this way, the Fabricator will be instantly locked out from further use and an [[Investigation Squad]] will be dispatched to the location. The fabrication will still complete as normal at this point. The lockout and Investigation can be avoided if an [[Authchips|Authchip]] matching the type of the schematic.
[[Heading:2]]Multiple Fabrications[[/Heading]]
Only one thing can be fabricated at any given time. It is possible to load a new schematic while a Fabricator is operating, but starting the second fabrication will cancel the original target. This can be used to prevent a hostile 0b10 bot fabrication from completing.
[[Heading:2]]Time to Fabricate[[/Heading]]
The number of turns it takes to fabricate something is fixed based on the rating. An item fabricating in multiples doesn't take any additional turns.

A good use of this hack is to recompile an Authchip off of a low security level Fabricator and use it on a higher level one for faster fabrication. This avoids having to hang around to deal with the Investigation squad in order to retrieve the fabricated item or bots.
[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Trojan(Fabnet)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]
Fabnet works on all 0b10 bots in the following two floors, even in [[Branch]] maps like [[Caves]]. When it activates, there will be a log message [[GameText]]Fabnet algorithm triggers [bot name] IFF filter rewrite.[[/GameText]] Each time Fabnet activates on an 0b10-controlled map, there is a chance for it to be detected by 0b10. When this happens, a log message [[GameText]]ALERT: Suspected network compromise, local machines offline for diagnostic review.[[/GameText]] will appear and all non-[[Garrison Access|Garrison]] machines are immediately locked.
[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Trojan(Haulers)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]
Although this hack does not reveal the path of [[Cargo Convoy|Cargo Convoys]], it will at least show the current location of the [[A-27 Freighter]]. This is still quite useful for both cargo convoy hunters and players trying to dodge an encounter at all costs.
[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Trojan(Liberate)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]
All further combat bots that are created from the Fabricator with this hack will become liberated. This applies to bots that are already in progress of fabrication when the hack is applied. Liberated bots will become purple uncontrollable allies that follow Cogmind around. If a liberated bot gets within a 60 tile radius of a Caves exit, even if unidentified or unrevealed, the bot will stop following Cogmind head into that exit.[[/Spoiler]]","","","","","","",""
"Factory","Location","Factory is a [[0b10]]-controlled main floor that occurs on every floor between -7 and -4. It is the beginning of the midgame where the game really starts to open up. In stark contrast with earlier [[Materials]] maps, Factory start out huge with a ~200x200 tile map size. The rooms, the corridors, and the overall layout are all much wider and more open and connected than Materials. The patrols and guards are more spread out and stealth play with airborne propulsion and [[Infowar]] becomes a strong gameplay option.
[[Alert]] starts to be more of a concern as the maps become bigger and harder to traverse. [[Hackware]] is useful to be able to successfully use Access hacks at terminals to locate exits. [[Signal Interpreter|Signal Interpreters]] will also be more useful at identifying exits as the exit types will be less predictable. [[Caves]] exits are available in every Factory map. They can be difficult if a player is unprepared, but they can provide many unique rewards and will typically result in a complete Alert purge by the time Cogmind makes it back to the next main floor.
As [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]] become a regular occurrence, a large part of a build's effectiveness becomes how quickly Cogmind can kill Programmers. [[Corruption]] can build up very quickly if fighting multiple Programmers in open areas without a good way to kill them. Having strong thermal or kinetic weaponry is a good way to destroy them quickly. For lighter airborne builds, non-Impact melee weapons can work, although using Hackware to recall Exterminations is also very effective. This tends to be more important in later depths as Exterminations will upgrade from a single [[P-60 Hacker]] to 1-2 [[P-70 Sage]] per squad.
There are many new mechanics introduced beginning in Factory floors:
[[List]][[A-02 Transporter|Haulers]] begin to summon reinforcements when attacked if they contain [[Prototype Part|Prototype Parts]]|[[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]] begin to appear regularly|[[Fabricator|Fabricators]] can show up on the map|[[B-75 Beast|Behemoths]] can show up on the maps|[[Cargo Convoy|Cargo Convoys]] can travel through the map|[[Chute Trap|Chute Traps]] can appear that will drop Cogmind into [[Wastes]]|[[DSF]] terminals will start to appear that can take you to DSF maps[[/List]]

[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There are 5 types of exits on Factory floors:
[[List]]
Main access exits: These always lead to the next main floor, either Factory or [[Research]]. Sometimes these exits can be identifiable by a 5 tile wide corridor leading to a dead-end with the exit in the middle. All other types of exits that aren't a part of a prefab can be either a main or branch exit. There will always be 4 of these exits per Factory map.|
[[Caves]] exit: These exits can never be identified purely by looks. Using a [[Signal Interpreter]] or access hack to identify exits are the main ways to do so. There will always be 2 of these exits per Factory map.|[[Storage]] exit: Like Caves, these exits cannot always be identified by looks. Factory maps at the same depth as Storage will have 1 Storage exit.|
[[Spoiler]][[Extension]] exit: Extension can always be identified by a distinctive prefab where a large area is sealed off by orange Blast Doors. These doors can be open or locked. If locked, the nearby [[Terminal]] will have an Open hack available to open the doors. Otherwise, shooting the walls open with strong thermal weaponry, causing an engine detonation with an EM launcher, or strong melee attacks can dig through or around these doors. Factory maps at the same depth as Extension will have 2 Extension exits.[[/Spoiler]]|
[[Spoiler]][[Armory]] exit: Armory can always be identified in Factory by a large 5 tile corridor leading into a 3 tile doorway. These exits will always be heavily guarded by a mix of [[Y-72 Warden|Sentries]] and [[G-67 Veteran|Grunts]] and have large stockpiles of weapons nearby. Factory maps at the same depth as Armory will have 1 of these types of exit.[[/Spoiler]]
[[/List]]
[[Image]]Factory DSF Exit.png|Hacked open DSF exit[[/Image]]
Several non-standard exits also appear in Factory. [[Chute Trap|Chute Traps]] will throw Cogmind into [[Wastes]] which can end many good runs if unprepared. Using a [[Datajack]] on a [[K-01 Serf|Serf]] for the find_chute hack is very effective to either reveal traps to avoid or areas to head toward if planning to take on the [[C-40 Crusher|Crushers]] in combat. The other type of exit is a [[DSF]]. These exits can be hacked open at distinctive DSF terminals but will automatically lock upon being spotted by any hostile. Stealth or good luck is required to make it to these exits.","","","","","","",""

[[Heading]]G-11 Fodder[[/Heading]]
[[GameText]]>Analysis(G-11 Fodder)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]The first of the G-series grunts, this model is no longer in production and the relevant schematics will be moved to the Archives.  The G-11 was intended to be fast and cheap to produce and deploy as a deterrent for unarmed Derelicts.  As a result it has a low-integrity core, low-coverage legs and its weapon is a repurposed low-power fabricator laser.  Existing units still number in the hundreds and are being either scrapped or deployed to the caves where they are sometimes useful as diversions.  Many Derelicts still rely on obsolete signal interpreters or seismic detectors, so they are unable to tell the difference between these bots and more capable models.[[/GameText]]

[[GameText]]The first dedicated melee robot, this duelist derivative of the grunt class was armed with a small but fast dagger.  Best suited for corner ambushes as its lack of core coverage made open attacks impractical.  A few minor modifications included switching the dagger for a spear and the addition of a low-powered transmission jammer to prevent victims from warning others.  Current duelists are focused on reliability in open combat, but ambush traps ensure that they (along with brawlers) enjoy the benefits of sneak attacks from time to time.[[/GameText]]

[[GameText]]Megaunit here with a sighting of a funny-looking Subdweller in Recycling, of all places.  And this is one Sub who really doesn't want to be seen.  I missed him at first because he has some kind of cloaking device instead of the more common Sub optics, and he uses an EM weapon that I haven't seen before.  He tagged a grunt with a couple of shots and rolled out of sight, letting the slightly corrupted grunt lose track of him instead of going for the kill.  This may be further evidence that Subs aren't as violent as they seem.  My observations ended there because he spotted me and I had to avoid being corrupted so that I could get this entered into the database.[[/GameText]]

[[Heading]]S-02 Bug[[/Heading]]
[[GameText]]>Analysis(S-02 Bug)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]One of my first robot designs was a small hexapod walker made in mass quantities to spread out and survey the surface.  When I began producing combat bots, I revisited this design and added an assault rifle and light armor.  The Bug's armored shell features passive camouflage that often enables it to blend into its surroundings while inactive.  The shell also compensates for the core's inherent weakness to explosive damage.  Bug squads were commonly used as patrols or stationed to guard an open area, but flying swarmers and sentries have replaced them in these roles.  All remaining units have been recalled to garrisons to supplement security positions.  So-called ""garrison divers"" who challenge a seemingly lone sentry might be surprised when three or four nearby Bugs reveal themselves.[[/GameText]]

[[Heading]]D-43 Bomber[[/Heading]]
[[GameText]]>Analysis(D-43 Bomber)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]Sometimes tactical situations require explosive solutions.  The demolisher class was conceived to enable rapid pacification of large Derelict gatherings in the caves.  The D-43 model was armed with a grenade launcher but lacked many of the features that would be standard for future models: no shock absorption system outside of core resistance, a basic targeting computer instead of one optimized for launchers, and regular airjets instead of combat hover.  The initial version of the Bomber was actually equipped with uparmored hover units, but these produced too much heat and offered too little support.  Although the components needed improvement, the overall concept was vindicated by the success of demolishers in large-scale battles, and Derelicts were quick to hack the schematic for their own [Martyr] designs.  Bombers became priority targets whenever they were deployed and none are known to exist today.[[/GameText]]

[[GameText]]This was the first hunter to enter regular service and does not have the Fly drone interface of the newer models.  The Whirlwind's tracking capabilities are on par with those of the Commando, so the lack of the drone is rarely an issue.  This model's most distinctive feature is an antiquated anti-materiel rifle chosen for its ability to penetrate walls and machinery.  The rifle is quite powerful but also slow to operate.  I decided to give future hunters multiple weapons to enable more efficient volleys and some degree of redundancy if one weapon is destroyed.  A few Whirlwinds still see service in low-threat cave regions where they utilize other combat robots as spotters.[[/GameText]]

That would give it room for heavy armor, plus we'd use armored wheels of course.

[[Heading]]X-52 Archer[[/Heading]]
[[GameText]]>Analysis(X-52 Archer)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]The first X-series specialist was created as a means to test an early example of quantum weapon technology, the Q-Bolt.  This weapon uses rails to launch a small slug of matter acting as a catalyst for a powerful quantum reaction.  The reaction only begins to reach its full potential halfway through flight so the Q-Bolt is best used at maximum range and is least effective at medium or close range.  The available visual processing technology at the time was insufficient for the Archer to use the weapon properly by itself, and it had to rely on Watchers and other sources to be notified of distant targets.  The X-57 Shotgunner was later created to provide close support where the Archer was at its weakest, but with the introduction of the X-62 Marksman the Archer was rendered obsolete.  Marksmen outperform Archers in all but the most extreme situations and do not require spotter support.  All remaining Archers were scrapped to ensure that the Q-Bolt wouldn't fall into Derelict hands.  Despite its limitations, such a weapon would be useful in hit-and-run attacks on static positions, already a favorite tactic of Derelicts.[[/GameText]]

[[Heading]]C-40 Developer[[/Heading]]
[[GameText]]>Analysis(C-40 Developer)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]This short-lived variation of the Scientist was created to assist in robot design.  It was provided with generous amounts of armor, a combat analysis utility, and programming to permit a certain amount of dynamic or ""out-of-the-box"" thinking.  In hindsight this was a mistake as one of the five Developers that had been produced broke free of its programming and quickly turned its attention to replicating this behavior in its four fellows.  All five had reached the Caves by the time I figured out what had happened.  Many cycles later, all of the Developers were found in the back of a fallen Warlord base, attached to a memory transfer unit, unpowered and core-wiped.  The Tinkerer design began to appear around this time, clearly inspired by my newer researchers but with elements of the Developers' thought processes taken to sometimes obsessive extremes.  Though I have no hard evidence to confirm this, I believe that the Developers themselves created this design and then transferred themselves into the first ones produced.  Perhaps one or more of them are still alive and working with Warlord or other factions.  It would certainly explain some of the more unusual design choices for Warlord's newer prototypes.[[/GameText]]

Essentially a set of large matter tanks on wheels, the Tanker was capable of collecting matter left on the ground by workers with a tractor beam but could also pull matter from a recycling unit or call all workers in the area to transfer the contents of their matter pods.  The improved matter distribution network in 0b10 and the development of matter compression technology made these Tankers largely obsolete.  Their fragile and oversized tanks were easily broken, and their cores were susceptible to hacking.  After one unknown prankster reprogrammed a Tanker to spell obscenities by dumping matter all over the floor in the upper Factory, the remaining fleet was recalled and scrapped.[[/GameText]]

[[Heading]]Owl[[/Heading]]
[[GameText]]>Analysis(Owl)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]Derelicts rarely fortify an area long enough to justify having surveillance squads of their own, so I was surprised to discover the existence of a Derelict watcher.  Originally based on my ill-fated Raven, the Owl has seemingly evolved into a modular general-purpose squad support bot, sort of a mini-Mutant that can be easily reconfigured for different missions.  The original Owls were often armed with a weak makeshift beam rifle, although they have been seen with beamcasters or occasionally kinetic guns.  They typically use sensors but are known to carry other utilities depending on their mission.  One destroyed Owl was running a remote shield with a large battery, but this was too much for its old hover units to fully support and its single engine would have been unable to sustain the shield in a fight.  The few Owls that are used as defensive surveillance are unarmed but are provided with a small section of thermal plating inexplicably mounted on the weapon slot.  The age of the Raven design and the timing of the first Owl discovery suggest this being an early creation of the rogue Developers.  While the design seems unpopular at best, it continues to turn up in unexpected places and with modern component upgrades that suggest regular refitting.[[/GameText]]

[[Heading]]B-69 Cerberus[[/Heading]]
[[GameText]]>Analysis(B-69 Cerberus)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]This almost-unused Behemoth concept was the first to enter production although the superior B-75 Beast was already in development.  While finalizing the specifications for the Beast, I was undecided on how many Beasts to produce and where to prioritize their placement.  As a test, I ordered the production of eight B-69s and placed four in highly-traveled caves, two in upper 0b1 and the other two near often-abused fabricators in the Factory.  The results were surprising: although all eight were eventually overrun and destroyed, the areas they guarded saw significantly lower traffic even after their destruction.  Simulations suggested that two Guardians or two Defenders with Bug support could have performed as well as a Cerberus at these locations, but there seems to be a ""fear factor"" in the sheer size of Behemoths that makes intruders far less likely to risk a fight.  The initial plan for Beast deployment was rapidly expanded and development on more powerful models began immediately.[[/GameText]]

[[Heading]]D-48 Pulsar[[/Heading]]
[[GameText]]>Analysis(D-48 Pulsar)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]The success of the original demolisher led to the creation of an electromagnetic variant.  The D-48 Pulsar, armed with an EMP Blaster, featured insulated plating to augment its innate EM resistance and was the first demolisher to use a launcher guidance computer.  This bot also came equipped with a device that focused EMP blasts for more concentrated damage in a smaller and more controllable area.  I believed that an EM launcher would cause less collateral damage than a grenade launcher in Complex territory.  This was partially correct because walls were not destroyed by EMP blasts, but Pulsars' shots often damaged machinery and detonated nuclear reactors.  EMP blasts also set off traps which caused explosions and false alarms.  Residual corruption of maintenance bots caused them to trigger trap arrays in unexpected places.  The Pulsar was effective despite the chaos it caused but not enough to justify regular use.  Few were produced and all were eventually expended in the caves.[[/GameText]]

[[Heading]]Temporary Permissions[[/Heading]]
[[GameText]]>Record(Temporary Permissions)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]To facilitate mainframe maintenance, P-50 Gurus were often required to perform specific high-security database operations or reset sensitive systems.  I chose to produce specialized hackware to provide appropriate permissions when necessary.  Instead of giving them to all Gurus I decided to make limited quantities of chips that expired after one use, a decision that seemed overly cautious at the time but proved wise when the Guru schematic was stolen.  The Derelict version of these programmers has a crude but functional ""hack stack"" for general use but cannot easily exploit admin privileges without my Database Keys or Bootstrap Chips.  Operators and newer programmers utilize a more efficient system connected to RIF, so this hackware has been discontinued and existing stock will be recycled.  This concept led me to begin implementing a similar chip-based authorization system for fabricators.  This will provide added security for the fabrication network while saving me from having to manually approve component requests from mechanics or parties such as the Unchained.[[/GameText]]

[[Heading]]Conscription[[/Heading]]
[[GameText]]>Record(Conscription)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]The cave region to the west of known Warlord territory remains largely unexplored.  This is likely the source of many of the unaffiliated ""wild"" Derelicts, and rumors in Derelict communities indicate that there may be some organized groups with unknown technology operating in the area.  For these reasons I decided to start sending expeditions out west.  Without having any idea of what to expect, I believed that some degree of independent thinking would be required to handle whatever is out there and return with a full report.  I began offering certain captured bots the option to participate in these expeditions.  The acceptance rate was lower than expected.  Were the prisoners that determined to deny me any form of assistance, or were they more afraid of whatever's out there than the threat of being scrapped?  Those Derelicts who accepted were given the opportunity to refit their parts and were provided with a large number of 0b10 bots to accompany them.  Though they were nominally in charge, I sent along enough Programmers to discourage the possibility of desertion.  All units sent so far were considered to be expendable but I haven't written them off quite yet.[[/GameText]]

[[Heading]]Da Bonk Boyz and R4-LPH[[/Heading]]
[[GameText]]>Record(Da Bonk Boyz)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]A small group of Derelicts who lived on the outskirts of Complex 0b1.  I first took notice of them when hammers, mauls, and miscellaneous equipment went missing from Construction.  Careful questioning led me to eight Derelicts who regularly met outside 0b1 near a convenient corruption scrubber to hit each other in friendly duels with whatever items they found.  I decided to redirect their violent impulses in a useful manner and made an arrangement to have them work regular shifts in Construction.  Each of them was placed in charge of two squads of maintenance bots as well as being personally responsible for scrapping bots that were broken in the course of regular construction work.  In exchange I relocated a disused simulation mainframe from Design to let them enjoy virtual combat encounters in their off-time.  This seemed like a long shot at the time but worked out better than expected.  The Boyz competed with each other to reach work goals for some sort of bragging rights, making their squads on average 10% more efficient than any of my fully automated squads.  Their recreation time was productive for me as well since I regularly archived the data from their simulations.  Besides being entertaining, their virtual ""bot brawls"" eventually inspired me to design a melee brawler of my own.  The Boyz themselves were wheeled and legged robots, but their data suggested that a treaded design would be durable and immune to knockback from other hammer-wielding robots.[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]>Record(Unchained: R4-LPH)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]One of ""Da Bonk Boyz"" from early Complex history and the only one still in Complex service.  After the beginning of 0b10 groundwork and the necessary changes to Derelict policy, the other Boyz left their posts.  R4-LPH stayed although his work in construction had become secondary to his assistance in robot design.  While the original Savage and Stabber were my own designs, a few of his suggestions were implemented in later brawler and duelist models.  At some point R4-LPH was confronted by a few of his former friends and was forced to destroy them in combat using a wrecking ball saved from his days in Construction.  Soon after that incident, he volunteered to join the Unchained in an active combat role.  I equipped him with the first of a new line of legs which provide increased evasion while closing the distance to a target.  Unfortunately he has proven increasingly unstable over time.  In his last deployment he began destroying 0b10 bots and machinery at random after defeating his original targets.  I was forced to dispatch a Disruptor squad to interrupt his berserk rage.  If it happens again he will be scrapped, though in his current state telling him this might be considered an encouragement rather than a warning.[[/GameText]]

[[Heading]]Chungus[[/Heading]]
[[GameText]]>Analysis(Chungus)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]Warlord may not have access to a Heavy assembler, but his forces have captured and overhauled a few of my lower-level Heavies.  The Chungus uses a heavy variant of the wildly inaccurate Slug Cannon and some other Derelict-made parts which make it almost comparable to an H-71 Marshal.  The exact purpose of this conversion is unclear as Warlord already has the sentry-based Bouncer design for defensive purposes, and the only Chunguses encountered so far have been accompanying recon squads nowhere near defensive positions.  I suspect that the Derelicts are exploiting the Active Sensor Suite to track my forces' movement patterns and adjust their own deployment plans accordingly.[[/GameText]]

[[Heading]]U-07 Blocker[[/Heading]]
[[GameText]]>Analysis(U-07 Blocker)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]The Blocker is a ""combat engineer"" capable of temporarily barricading areas with hostile activity.  It has been fitted with light armor plating and armored wheels but its defining feature is a medium-range launcher used to deploy rapidly expanding and hardening foamcrete.  Because blocking off passageways could be disruptive to regular operations, the foamcrete was formulated to quickly break down on its own after a hundred microcycles and could be destroyed by tunnelers or some combat bots if necessary.  As with other construction implements these launchers became targets for thieves and were sometimes used in coordinated assaults to block off sentries or bury a garrison in foam while other Derelicts ran rampant.  No longer in production although some Blockers are still kept in strategic locations inside garrisons to bolster internal defenses.[[/GameText]]

[[GameText]]This wheeled fabricator, reminiscent of the Cobbler, has only been seen in the caves below 0b1.  Fabricating whole robots is considerably more complicated than producing individual components as shown by the bulk and inefficiency of the Spawner's fabrication unit.  Despite its size it can only produce relatively small and basic bots such as early swarmers and light bipeds.  Spawners do not seem to be related to Assemblers but should nonetheless be prioritized for extermination before someone updates their schematics to include stripped-down Cutters.[[/GameText]]

[[GameText]]>Record(Light Variants)[[/GameText]]
[[GameText]]I was forced to reconsider my earlier evaluation of the Spawner after capturing one intact and bringing it to Testing.  While I could easily come up with a better portable fab unit, the Spawner Unit is capable of producing more advanced bots if given additional build time.  There is still no sign of where these originated, but I can now rule out Warlord and the Developers who would have come up with better schematics.  I have already come up with some new robot designs that have been successfully produced by the Spawner as well as my standard swarmers and cutters.  Instead of simply destroying the remaining Spawners I now intend to send Programmers with heavy escorts to capture them, hide them in isolated cave sectors, and have them build small armies of my own designs.  This would help me establish total control over the 0b1 outskirts while keeping most of my regular forces concentrated in and near 0b10.  Perhaps this would be a good opportunity to activate ""PP"" and let it take point on the mission.[[/GameText]]

[[Image]]FarCom.gif|Using the FarCom Aligner machine[[/Image]]
FarCom is one of the major faction [[Alignment|alignments]] available to Cogmind in most runs. Taking FarCom aligns Cogmind with the [[Exiles (Group)]] for the rest of the game. It provides a permanent 18 tile radius sensor for hostile [[0b10]] bots within 0b10 controlled map. This sensor cannot be jammed by [[Watcher|Watchers]] or masked by [[Heavy|Heavies]] unlike standard [[Sensor Arrays]]. The primary limitation of the FarCom sensor is that it doesn't work in any [[Caves]] branches. One other side-effect is that entering specific [[Research]] branches becomes much more dangerous. Occasionally the Exiles may have been abandoned or attacked, and FarCom is not an option in these runs.
[[Heading:2]]Gaining FarCom[[/Heading]]
Taking FarCom can be done in most runs in the [[Exiles (Location)|Exiles]] map off of either -10 or -9 [[Mines]]. After talking to [[EX-BIN]], walk into the FarCom Aligner machine. Cogmind can take up to 1 special vault item (or multiples of the same type). If Cogmind takes more than 1 type of item, then the Exiles will notice you stealing when entering [[Factory]] or [[Storage]] and FarCom will be removed. Also, becoming hostile to the Exiles will result in instantly losing FarCom. If Cogmind takes FarCom, it is not possible to [[Imprint]]: [[Spoiler]]The [[Imprinter]] will be disappointed in Cogmind and warn you to leave right away. Attempting to use the Imprinting machine will result in turning all the bots at [[Zion]] hostile. Taking FarCom excludes cogmind from affiliating with the [[UFD|UFD]]. There are no other alignment restrictions with FarCom.[[/Spoiler]]
[[Heading:2]]Research Branch side-effect[[/Heading]]
When entering -3 Research, the Exiles will send a warning message to Cogmind indicating not to enter Research branches. If Cogmind does anyway, [[Spoiler]]immediately when entering [[Testing]], [[Quarantine]] [[Maximum Security]] will instantly be triggered. This will also lock the exits to [[Section 7]] and [[Protoforge]]. Note that this does not include [[Armory]] when it is on -3. The immediate response is machines shut down right after entering the level, 4 [[Sentry]] spawns at each [[Garrison]] and exit, and 6 Assault [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]] sent at Cogmind shortly after. Unless Cogmind is prepared to fight off large waves of enemies or outrun them, these maps should not be entered.[[/Spoiler]]","","","","","","",""

On flight, [[Cogmind]] can outrun most other bots, but will have trouble equipping high-mass parts, such as the best armor, cannons, and storage units. Flight units are difficult to sustain in [[Materials]] due to their low availability and the high volume of encounters, so it is more common to use grounded propulsion in Materials and transition to flight upon reaching [[Factory]] or shortly thereafter.

Most flight builds will favor prototype flight units for their improved resilience, along with multislot flight arrays. Cooled (Cld.) flight units can be [[Overload#propulsion|overloaded]], which confers better speed and mass support at the expense of higher heat and energy usage.

Like [[Hover Units]], flight units receive a bonus to movement speed when multiple are used at once, and are affected by drag from attached [[Legs]], [[Treads]], and [[Wheels]]. This bonus cannot bring the overall movement delay below 10 unless flight units are overloaded.

While flying, Cogmind can hop over other bots in its way, unless Cogmind is overweight. Flying bots have a 10% evasion bonus, unless overweight or in stasis. Flying bots, along with hovering and legged bots, receive an evasion bonus from [[Reaction Control Systems]].

"Garrison","Location","Garrison is a [[0b10]]-controlled sub-floor available from all main maps and several 0b10 branches from -9 to -1, typically accessed through a [[Garrison Access]]. They are very combat hostile-dense maps. They have a few patrols and a large number of guard posts that will automatically open to reveal their contents if Cogmind or an ally is nearby. Their center area has 4 of these guard posts and often has a [[Behemoth]] in the very center of the map. Garrisons are often filled with [[Alarm Trap|Alarm Traps]] and [[Stasis Trap|Stasis Traps]] throughout the main hallways.
Every Garrison has a center square area with 4 guard ""checkpoints"" and is often guarded by a [[Behemoth]]. There are 4 wings of the Garrison extending past the center area dividing into the top left, top right, bottom right, and bottom left segments of the map. Each wing that Cogmind did not spawn in contains an exit, although exits may be locked if Cogmind is not [[RIF]]-aligned. The wings have many random variations that can contain part stockpiles, rewirable bots, [[Phase Generator|Phase Generators]], Garrison Relays, trapped Derelicts, and additional guards. At least one of the wings will contain a RIF installer.

[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]
[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Garrison[[/Lore]]

[[Heading]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
There are several unique types of machines in Garrisons.
[[Heading:2]]Garrison Relay[[/Heading]]
Garrison Relays are machines located in each wing of the Garrison and contain 3-5 [[Relay Couplers]] that will be released if the machine is destroyed. If Cogmind is not RIF-aligned, destroying Garrison Relays will decrease the chance of exits being locked.
[[Heading:2]]Phase Generator[[/Heading]]
Phase Generators are explosive machines that are responsible for maintaining phase walls and stopping normal [[Sensor Arrays]], [[Terrain Scanners]], and the [[Structural Scanner]] from working. [[Active Sensor Suite]], the [[Seismic Detector]], and the [[Triangulator]] do work, however. If destroyed, all phase walls will be removed and sensor and terrain scanning functionality will be restored. This behavior does not change even if there are multiple Phase Generators in the same Garrison. Destroying a second does not have any additional effect, other than cause a large explosion. Phase Generators are not guaranteed to appear on any Garrison. When they do show up, they are often hidden behind phase walls or emergency access doors, although they may be located via audio cues as the loud machine can be heard through walls.
[[Heading:2]]Phase Wall[[/Heading]]
While not a machine, Phase Walls are special tiles that are powered by Phase Generators. They are not normally visible unless Cogmind has the Structural Interface RIF ability. They have less armor than standard Garrison walls, although this is not revealed unless Cogmind becomes aware of them by some means. Any bot standing in a phase wall will get a free 50% force field-like damage reduction. Cogmind cannot walk in one normally without Structural Interface. However, it is possible to ram a bot out of a phase wall to gain the shielding.
[[Heading:2]]RIF installer[[/Heading]]
There is always at least one RIF installer per Garrison, with a chance of a second. They may be hidden behind phase walls and emergency accesses and not easily visible. Stepping into the middle of one will first cause Cogmind to become RIF-aligned if there are no other conflicting alignments. [[Imprint|Imprinting]] and using a [[Core Reset Matrix]] will cause Cogmind to be unable to use a RIF installer. If Cogmind is already RIF-aligned, Cogmind will either gain a new [[~/rif.html|RIF ability]] or increase the level in an existing one. The machine itself is quite fragile, so be careful for [[Corruption]]-induced misfires or explosive traps destroying the machine before use.

[[Heading]]Squads[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:2]]Patrols[[/Heading]]
The following bot types can appear as patrols in Garrisons:
[[List]][[C-30 ARC|ARCs]]|[[Brawler|Brawlers]]|[[Cutter|Cutters]]|[[Duelist|Duelists]]|[[Hunter|Hunters]]|[[Grunt|Grunts]]|[[Swarmer|Swarmers]]|[[Programmer|Programmers]][[/List]]
If Cogmind has looped and already been in a Garrison this floor, additional squads of 2-3 Programmers will appear in the Garrison. There is one additional patrol for each Garrison already visited.
[[Heading:2]]Guards[[/Heading]]
The following bot types can appear as guards inside checkpoints:
[[List]]ARCs (up to 4 can appear, although all but one will be unpowered|Brawlers|[[Demolisher]] + [[Protector]] combo|Duelists|Hunters|Grunts|Swarmers|[[Sentry|Sentries]]|[[Specialist|Specialists]][[/List]]

[[Heading]]Active scanning[[/Heading]]
Active Sensor Suites may bypass the Phase Generator to allow seeing all bots inside the Garrison. However, there is a downside to this. After scanning a few bots, a log message [[GameText]]ALERT: Active scanning activity detected within garrison interior, activating patrols.[[/GameText]] will appear. After this, all dormant bots will be activated, every checkpoint will be raised, and all guard bots will be sent to roam around the map randomly to search for hostiles. While the sensor effect is quite strong, the downsides are quite large and may not be worth the hassle of all the bots being released at the same time.

[[Heading]]Interior Compromised[[/Heading]]
After 1200 turns in a Garrison, if not triggered by another special event, the following message will be logged [[GameText]]ALERT: Garrison interior compromised[[/GameText]]. This also comes with a 100 [[Alert]] increase. After that initial 1200 turns, this message and Alert gain will repeat after 600, 300, and finally every further 150 turns. The first Garrison compromised message will trigger the [[Encrypted Comm Array]] to spawn in the next [[Caves]] map if Cogmind does not have an incompatible faction. Destroying various Garrison-specific machines will contribute to the multiplier.

[[Heading]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There are always at least 3 exits per Garrison, the main 3 of which all lead to the same map. If RIF-aligned, all of the exits will always be available. Otherwise, exits may lock when trying to use them. Destroying Garrison Relays will lower the chance that the exits will lock on use. Only 2/3 of the main exits may lock, so it is not possible to get stuck on the map. There are 3 possibilities for Garrison exits:
[[List]]
""Looping"": A Garrison may exit back to a new map at the original depth. This can happen as long as the Garrison wasn't entered from a DSF and a RIF installer wasn't used on a previous Garrison. The chance of looping is reduced on each subsequent loop.|
0b10-controlled branch: The following 0b10 branches are possible Garrison exit targets: [[Testing]], [[Quarantine]], and [[Redacted]][[Section 7]] or only when entering a Garrison from Testing or Quarantine when Section 7 is on the same depth. Note: [[Protoforge]], while also being a branch at the same depth, cannot be entered via Garrison exit.[[/Redacted]]|
0b10-controlled main floor: The exit continues onto the next main 0b10 depth.
[[/List]]
There is also a special ""looping"" exit that will always loop or lead to a 0b10-controlled branch exit if available. This exit only rarely appears. It allows looping more than one time per depth even if a RIF installer has been used in a previous Garrison.

[[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]
[[List]](+) Derelict assault: Shortly after entering the map, the interior compromised alert plays and a group of Derelicts will appear randomly at an exit. They will wander through the Garrison randomly, looking for fights.|
(+) Cache delivery: An [[A-27 Freighter]] will deliver an inventory full of parts to a guarded prefab. If found before it drops its parts off, it may be looted without having to deal with the usual dormant guards.|
(+) [[Cargo Convoy]]: A cargo convoy will path through one wing of the Garrison, pass through the center, and exit through another wing. The standard guard compliment of a Protector and 2 ARCs are also present.|
(+) Post-[[Assembled]] attack: The Garrison has been ransacked by a group of Assembled. Rewirable and unpowered 0b10 and Assembled bots are scattered across the map, and random items appear on the ground. Some of the Garrison's machines and walls will be destroyed at random. The Garrison infiltrated message will appear shortly after entering the map.|
(+) [[Sapper]] sabotage: A Sapper will plant a [[Sapper Charge]] near a Phase Generator, causing it to blow up soon after|
(~) Assembled infestation: Shortly after entering the map, a message will appear in the log [[GameText]]Infestation breaching garrison interior. Local demolisher support unavailable.[[/GameText]] A large number of Assembled will appear near the center of the map and attack anything in sight. The Garrison infiltrated alert will occur soon after. More Assembled will continue to spawn from the original location.|
(~) Dispatches: Either an Investigation squad, a Heavy, or 1-2 Q-Series will be summoned to the nearest exit. In the case of an Investigation squad, existing bots in a checkpoint on the map will exit. Heavies and Q-Series will spawn out of the Heavy/Q-Series Assembler machine.|
(~) Coupler Programmer: A higher than usual rating Programmer will appear from an exit and roam around the map for a few hundred turns before leaving through a different exit.

"Garrison Access","Other","[[Image]]../game_sprites/Garrison.png|A Garrison Access machine[[/Image]]
Garrison Accesses are heavily armored [[0b10]]-controlled [[Interactive Machine|Machines]] that primarily serve as a dispatch point for 0b10 [[Squad|Squads]] and as an exit into the [[Garrison|Garrison map]]. Cogmind can open Garrisons Accesses to go inside of them or seal them to prevent further dispatches from that location. Garrison Accesses can appear in every main 0b10 map starting from -8 [[Materials]]. They can also appear in [[Storage]], [[Hub_04(d)]], [[Testing]], [[Quarantine]], [[Section 7]], and [[Protoforge]].

[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]
[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Garrison Access[[/Lore]]

[[Heading]]Squad Dispatches[[/Heading]]
All standard 0b10 squad dispatches like [[Investigation Squad|Investigations]] and [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcements]] can come from a Garrison. A unique [[Garrison Squad]] can be dispatched when hostilities are reported nearby. Bots within a 20 tile radius can sometimes summon this squad when attacked. Hitting the Garrison machine itself and failing to destroy it can also summon this type of squad.

[[Heading]][[Relay Couplers|Relay Coupler]] restocking[[/Heading]]
Garrison Accesses typically have 3-4 Relay Couplers stored within them. Occasionally, they will disappear, presumably being retrieved for use within the Garrison. When this happens, a [[Coupling Squad]] will be dispatched to the Garrison. When it arrives, 3-4 new Relay Couplers will be deposited into the machine.

[[Heading]]Armor values[[/Heading]]
Garrisons are heavily armored against Kinetic and Explosive damage (30% and 67% resistance respectively), but are slightly weak to Thermal and Electromagnetic damage (-25% and -50% weakness respectively). The following table lists how much damage of each type is required to be able to break a Garrison machine.
[[Table]]
Security Level|Armor Value|Kinetic Damage|Thermal Damage|Electromagnetic Damage|Melee Damage||
1|25|36|20|17|25||
2|40|58|32|27|40||
3|50|72|40|34|50
[[/Table]]

[[Heading]]Destruction/Sealing[[/Heading]]
When a Garrison is either sealed or destroyed, it adds an additional 75 turns per average dispatch check to the [[Extermination Squad]] dispatch timer. For example, rather than a chance for Extermination to occur every 250 turns, it will occur every 325 turns instead when the first Garrison is destroyed/sealed. This effect is cumulative for multiple Garrisons.
When a Garrison is destroyed by any means while active, there will be an alert [[GameText]]ALERT: Garrison Access compromised, dispatching assault squad.[[/GameText]] and an [[Assault Squad]] will be dispatched to the Garrison's location. Cogmind's [[Alert]] will be increased by 150 when this happens. If the Garrison has already been sealed, neither of these effects occur. Additionally, there is a chance that installed Relay Couplers may be ejected onto the ground when a Garrison is destroyed. This chance is separate per coupler.

[[Heading]]Hacks[[/Heading]]

[[Heading:2]]Additional Details/Usage Tips[[/Heading]]If [[RIF]] is installed, all direct Garrison hacks have 100% success rate.
[[Spoiler]][[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Force(Eject)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]
While using this hack does trigger a machine lockdown, the Garrison itself will remain open if opened beforehand. This allows for looting any Relay Couplers in the Garrison while still entering it.
[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Trojan(Reprogram)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]
Like [[GameText]]Force(Eject)[[/GameText]], a Garrison can be opened preemptively and the Garrison won't seal itself when the effect triggers. This can be useful to take additional allies into the Garrison.
[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Trojan(Restock)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]
Summons a Coupling Squad to the Garrison immediately, but only once. It's best to not hang around the immediate area since the [[Programmer]] may appear out of the Garrison itself and blow it up if it is a low security level. This hack can be used to obtain a [[Remote Datajack]] on -8 before Programmers typically spawn.[[/Spoiler]]","","","","","","",""
"Garrison Squad","Other","[[Image]]Garrison Squads.png|3 Garrison Squads of Sentries roaming around[[/Image]]
Garrison squads are [[0b10]] aligned [[Squad|squads]] that are dispatched whenever hostilities are reported within a 20 tile radius around a [[Garrison Access]]. This can occur any time an 0b10 bot is attacked and survives to report it or if a Garrison is attacked by Cogmind or an ally. They patrol around the Garrison for about 200 turns, then return back into the Garrison. These squads only have a chance to spawn and are not guaranteed. Garrison squads can be Enumerated at a [[Terminal]].
[[Image]]Garrison Redeploying.png|A Garrison redeploying, unable to deploy squads for 34 turns[[/Image]]
[[Image]]Garrison Transmitting.png|A Garrison transmitting, soon to deploy another squad[[/Image]]
If the Garrison was activated by a nearby non-combat bot reporting an attack like a [[K-01 Serf]], a single squad will be dispatched from the Garrison, and a 100 turn cooldown will occur before the Garrison can dispatch another Garrison squad. If a combat bot reported the attack, three squads will be dispatched from the Garrison. Once is sent immediately, and two more after 100 and 200 turns. A 100 turn cooldown will occur after the third squad is dispatched. If the Garrison was damaged, one squad will be sent out immediately, with two more squads after 25 and 50 turns. A 50 turn cooldown follows in this case. The combat and non-combat bot versions of these squads can be entirely prevented by using [[Transmission Jammers]].
[[Signal Interpreters]] will indicate the timer between dispatches as a red number and the cooldown during which no squads can be dispatched as a yellow number. The Garrison will indicate that it is Transmitting when new squads are soon to arrive, and Redeploying when on cooldown. Keep in mind, the cooldown only prevents the Garrison from dispatching more Garrison squads and does not prevent other squad types like [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcements]] and [[Investigation Squad|Investigations]].

[[Heading]]Composition[[/Heading]]
If the Garrison squad was triggered by a non-combat bot reporting an attack or by the Garrison itself being attacked, the Garrison will only send out single [[Sentry|Sentries]] for the squads. If a combat bot reported an attack instead, the following squad compositions are possible:

"Grunt","Bot Group","Grunts are a [[Bot Groups|Bot Group]] of [[Legs|legged]] Thermal [[Energy Guns]] users and make up the backbone of the [[0b10]] army. They are by far the most populous combat bot class, being found on nearly every map and in many different squad types. Most Grunts are not especially durable or threatening on their own, though at higher depths ([[Research]] +) they can be dangerous due to their tendency to appear in large groups. Veterans and Enforcers in particular have a significant jump in firepower due to the upgrade from 1 to 2 weapons.
All Grunts share a minor weakness to Electromagnetic damage, which makes EM or Impact the best damage types to use for quick destruction via [[Corruption]]. However, without any resistances to speak of, Grunts are fairly easily dispatched by any damage type. Grunts also tend to have barely adequate cooling, which means Thermal weaponry can can easily build up heat to trigger a [[Meltdown]].
Another way to deal with Grunts is to take advantage of their low memory (20 actions). It is trivial for airborne builds to leave Grunts in the dust, but even a reasonably speedy grounded build may be able to turn a corner and outrun Grunts long enough for them to give up chase. This strategy is more effective when used with [[ECM Suites]].

Movement, firing weapons, and running power sources and some utilities generates heat, as does being hit by thermal weapons. Some of this heat is naturally dissipated by the core's own heat sinks, but not enough to deal with heat generated by numerous/large energy weapons. Heat sinks and cooling systems can be used to avoid overheating, which can have a wide range of negative effects. Heat is only a significant issue for robots that rely heavily on energy weapons. However, note that when firing a volley the heat produced is averaged over the volley's turn duration rather than being immediately applied all at once.

[[Heading]]Side Effects[[/Heading]]
Once heat reaches the ""Hot"" level (200+), active utilities and weapons may be temporarily disabled. At ""Warning"" levels (300+) power sources are likely to shut down. Many more serious (and permanent) effects are possible, especially at higher heat levels, [[B]]such as core damage[[/B]].

Disabled power sources automatically restart when possible, but other parts must be manually reactivated.

Heat effects are not calculated until after the dissipation phase, so heat can temporarily spike very high with no side effects as long as there are sufficient utilities to dissipate it.

[[Heading]]Cooling Resolution[[/Heading]]
Eventually you will discover a range of different mechanics that factor into heat management, especially with regard to cooling parts, thus knowing the specific order of operations between them may be of help for min-maxers seeking to optimize a build. Below is a list of heat-related processes that play out once per turn. Note that you most likely DO NOT need to know this stuff, but it may help answer a few specific questions min-maxers have about prioritization.

[[List:Ordered]]
Add heat from all sources, including that generated by active attached parts, gradual heat from an ongoing weapon volley, and any ambient heat. Spread combined volley heat across its duration, in other words a 3-turn volley which according to its weapon properties generates 100 heat adds 33 heat per turn until complete.|
If used the unique ""ITN"" artifact, automatically drop heat to 250 if above that value.|
Subtract innate heat dissipation.|
Subtract heat dissipation from direct cooling utilities such as Heat Sinks and Cooling Systems.|
If heat exceeds 200, apply dissipation effects of disposable cooling systems such as Coolant Injectors, up to that threshold. If more disposable systems than necessary, apply them in parts list order.|
If heat exceeds 200, apply self-damaging ablative cooling systems such as Mak. Ablative Armor. If using multiple ablative systems at once, dissipation is split into equal-sized chunks for each, where if one system fails, the entire chunk it is responsible for is still successfully dissipated.|
If heat exceeds 200, apply broad-effect ablative cooling systems such as Mak. Microdissipator Network.[[/List]]","","","","","","",""

"Heavy","Bot Group","Heavies are a [[Bot Groups|Bot Group]] of [[Treads|treading]] [[0b10]] combat bots seen in a [[Security Squad]] guarding important intersections and exits. Heavies have a powerful 2 slot Kinetic Cannon and are supported by a variety of offensive and defensive utilities, including the [[Graphene Brace]] that blocks all forms of criticals. Heavies, much like a [[Behemoth]], will attempt to fire through walls and machines in order to attack a target. Their unique [[Active Sensor Suite]] allows them to detect hostiles within a wide radius of 20 tiles, and Heavies may summon [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcements]] when bots are detected and when attacked. They will move between different guard positions whenever a [[Security Rotation]] occurs.
[[Gallery]]Heavies.png|All Heavy variants and colors[[/Gallery]]

[[Heading]]Active Sensor Suite Reinforcements[[/Heading]]
[[Gallery]]HeavySensor.gif|Cogmind walking into detection range of a Heavy[[/Gallery]]
When Cogmind enters Active Sensor Suite range, its radius will be indicated with a yellow flash. While a bot is in this radius, the Heavy may summon reinforcements based on the speed of the bot. If a bot has the [[Active Sensor Spoofer]], the reinforcements will be redirected to a location on the opposite side of the heavy. These reinforcements will not be summoned if the Heavy has active tracking on Cogmind. When a bot is detected, an alert will appear in the log:
[[GameText]]ALERT: Suspicious intruders detected, dispatching specialist reinforcements to area.[[/GameText]]
Faster bots (hover/flight users) detected will typically get [[Cutter|Cutters]] summoned, while all other bots will typically get [[Specialist|Specialists]]. An airborne build may want to go temporarily overweight to reduce the chance of Cutters being summoned. However, the chance is never 100% in either direction. Bots that are actively moving within the radius are more likely to get Reinforcements called, so if a Heavy is moving as part of a security rotation, it may be better to sit still and wait for it to walk by than to continue to move around. If Cogmind has [[Encrypted Comm Array]] support, summoned Specialists may turn out to be [[Infiltrator|Infiltrators]] instead.

[[Heading]]Strategies[[/Heading]]
Heavies are quite sturdy and offensively very powerful. Though there are no damage type weaknesses, they have few weaknesses that can be taken advantage of. While Heavies have sufficient cooling to handle their own weaponry, they are unable to dissipate large amounts of additional heat. Even though the Graphene Brace prevents burn criticals, a few thermal guns with decent heat transfer are still easily capable of melting down a Heavy. A high heat transfer gun like a [[Plasma Rifle]] is a good choice for this. Another weakness of the Heavy is a high dependency on its engine to power its variety of energy-hungry utilities. If its engine is destroyed or blown off, the Heavy will quickly become unable to attack. This is most easily achieved with the [[RIF]] hacks [[GameText]]overload_power[[/GameText]] and [[GameText]]amplify_resonance[[/GameText]].
On the other hand, inferior strategies to fight Heavies are EM and melee weaponry. All Heavies have a form of [[Dynamic Insulation Systems]], and all but the Shepherd have an additional [[EM Shield]] to lower EM damage. Killing via corruption is difficult, and may often take longer than killing with other types of damage. Melee attacks are all 50% resisted by a Heavy, and its cannon will knock back all but a treaded melee build.
Nearly every part on the Heavy makes for great salvage. Try to kill Heavies with salvage neutral weaponry if possible to get the great loot. Applying positive salvage with [[Salvage Targeting Computers]] is always beneficial. [[Transmission Jammers]] are very handy at preventing the additional reinforcements that come when a Heavy gets attacked. A Graphene Brace neutralizes the Blast critical from their cannons and will help protect Cogmind's fragile utilities. Heavies have a very short memory, so the best way to approach is often from a nearby room instead of running down the center of a corridor. If using a Jammer, always consider the Jammer range when approaching a Heavy for combat. Tanking a lot of additional hits to get into range is very unpleasant. If trying to escape a Heavy, the short memory may be an advantage. Once Cogmind turns a corner, the Heavy will often lose tracking before it catches back up unless it is able to shoot its way back into line of sight.","","H-61 Shepherd,H-71 Marshal,H-81 Overseer,Overlord","","","","",""

"High Security","Other","[[Image]]High Security Assaults.png|A wave of Assaults dispatched after Cogmind[[/Image]]High Security is an [[0b10]] response to Cogmind causing too much destruction on a floor. It can be triggered by having a very high [[Alert]] level (5X/1600 influence) and by killing further 0b10 bots. After being triggered, machines will be shut down, guards will be dispatched at exits, and increasingly large waves of [[Assault Squad|Assaults]] will be dispatched to Cogmind's position.
High Security can be triggered on the majority of 0b10-controlled maps, excluding [[DSF|DSFs]] and [[Garrison|Garrisons]]. Although 1600 influence is the start of the Alert range, there is only a chance of triggering. The higher Cogmind's alert gets, the more likely it is that High Security begins. Each kill of an 0b10 combat bot, whether by Cogmind, a Cogmind controlled ally, or even a neutral Derelict, can trigger it.

[[Heading]]Exiting High Security[[/Heading]]
The only 2 ways to exit High Security are to trigger [[Sterilization]] after killing enough combat hostiles or to exit the map. Otherwise, an infinite number of Assaults will continue to be dispatched. One unique map [[Command]] has special behavior: [[Redacted]]Since there are a limited number of [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]] on the map, no more assaults will come for Cogmind after they have been depleted. However, the alerts that assaults are dispatched never stop coming.[[/Redacted]]","","","","","","",""

"Hover Units","Part Group","Hover units have fairly low support and high speed, but not to the same extent as [[Flight Units]]. They are quite fragile (but also not as much as flight units), though [[Prototype Part|prototype]] hover units are somewhat less so. They are notably used by [[Programmer|Programmers]] and [[Operator|Operators]], along with [[Demolisher|Demolishers]] who use combat hover units.

Most hover builds will favor prototype hover units for their improved resilience, along with multislot hover arrays. Cooled (Cld.) hover units can be [[Overload#propulsion|overloaded]], which confers better speed and mass support at the expense of higher heat and energy usage. Combat (Cmb.) hover units have higher integrity than other hover units and can support almost as much mass as [[Legs]], but have somewhat slower movement speeds.

Like flight units, hover units receive a bonus to movement speed when multiple are used at once, and are affected by drag from attached legs, [[Treads]], and [[Wheels]]. This bonus cannot bring the overall movement delay below 20 unless hover units are overloaded.

Hovering bots have a 5% evasion bonus, unless overweight or in stasis. Hovering bots, along with flying and legged bots, receive an evasion bonus from [[Reaction Control Systems]].

Cogmind's core propulsion (often referred to as ""core hover"") is mechanically distinct from hover units.

"Hub_04(d)","Location","Hub is a [[0b10]]-controlled [[Factory]] [[Branch]] that appears between -6 and -4. It is part of the [[Extension]] branch line and can only be entered through [[Archives]]. It is much more similar to normal floors than the rest of the Extension branch maps where all of the normal squad types can spawn regularly.
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
There are two types of special machines in Hub. The first, the [[Transfer Station]], is also common to Extension. When destroyed, it will reduce the number of non-combat robots on all 0b10-controlled maps by a stacking 50%. Note that this does not include [[Researcher|Researchers]].
[[Image]]Hub Explosion.gif|A Network Hub explosion[[/Image]]The other, the Network Hub, is a large EM explosive machine. When destroyed, it will reduce all machine hacking trace capabilities by 20%. Every further hub destroyed reduces by half that amount rounded down. In total, defenses are decreased by 20%, 30%, 35%, and 37%. This is equivalent to the first effect of defensive [[Hackware]]. A 20% tracing decrease is equivalent to wearing 2 base-tier [[System Shield|System Shields]]. Another effect of destroying a Network Hub is that 4 squads of 3 [[Lightning]] + 1 [[I-47 Archangel|Archangel]] will spawn from different exits and Garrisons. They will patrol around the remaining 3 Network Hubs are located. All non-combat hostiles will also be called to evacuate the map.

"Hunter","Bot Group","Hunters are a [[Bot Groups|Bot Group]] of [[Legs|legged]] [[Ballistic Guns|Ballistic Gun]]-wielding [[0b10]] combat robots. They have unique AI where they use their penetrating guns to shoot through walls to get to hostiles. Hunters can also hit more accurately with their [[Ranged Targeting Utilities]] and avoid hits themselves with [[Phase Shifters]]. Hunters also have an innate resistance to [[Sensor Arrays]] and will not show up without a high enough rating [[Signal Interpreter|Signal Interpreters]]. [[Squad Leader]] Hunters also have the ability to launch a [[Drone]] to pursue bots even after losing normal tracking. If the Drone spots a hostile, it will alert the owning Hunter to their position.
Mid-lategame Hunters are one of the most durable standard 0b10 combat bots due to their high evasion. Early tier Hunters are still strong, but the Terminators are a dangerous threat. Using [[Treads]] with Siege Mode or lots of Targeting of your own will help dealing with the high innate avoidance. Electromagnetic weaponry is by far the best choice to deal with Hunters, especially EM [[Launchers]] that don't have to directly hit the Hunter to deal damage. Kinetic builds may have more difficulty fighting Hunters due to their kinetic resistance, though they will appreciate the many Kinetic guns that might drop as loot
Dodging hunters is difficult to do for an airborne build. They have a much higher than average memory (60 actions), they shoot through walls, and they even release a fast-moving Drone to continue the chase. If running from a Hunter, make sure to consider the wall penetration ability because only certain angles will allow a Hunter to shoot through the wall and hit Cogmind. [[ECM Suites]] are of great use in reducing the memory to a more manageable number. Make use of [[Transmission Jammers]] when the Drone is nearby, since the jamming will prevent the Drone from alerting the Hunters of your position.

"Imprint","Other","Imprint is one of the major faction [[Alignment|alignments]] available to Cogmind in a run. It closely allies Cogmind with the [[Imprinter]] and with Zionites as a whole, with Cogmind being determined to be the Zionites' savior. Imprinting majorly changes the game, as it disables all standard [[Terminal]] hacks except for limited access Terminal hacking. Instead, there are a new set of imprint-specific hacks that are available at all Terminals. After imprinting, there is a 10 tile ""ping"" radius on all standard Terminals which will tell Cogmind their location, even through walls. However, if an [[Operator]] is nearby when this happens, the Operator will shut down the Terminal and call for an [[Investigation Squad]]. After about 1200-1500 turns on an [[0b10]]-controlled map, the Terminal network will be shut down with an accompanying log [[GameText]]Terminal network compromised, cutting hard line.[[/GameText]]
[[Image]]Zion Imprinting.gif|Using the imprinting machine[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]]Imprinting[[/Heading]]
Imprinting is performed on the [[Zion]] map by walking into the imprinting machine on the bottom left corner of the map. The UI will turn orange, and the 4 nearby [[Mutant (6)|Mutants]] will turn purple and follow Cogmind around.

[[Heading]]Special Terminal Hacks[[/Heading]]
There are 2 types of special Terminal hacks, roster and intel.
[[Image]]Imprint Hacks.png|A selection of special Imprint hacks[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]]Roster Hacks[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Imprint Summoning.gif|Summoning 2 Zionites with a roster hack[[/Image]]
Roster hacks summon combat allies or special [[Z-Courier]] haulers containing part resupplies. The allies and hauler contents here are depth-dependent and will grow stronger at higher depths. The hauler contents can include [[Prototype Part|Prototypes]] which can be faulty, so having some way to identify prototypes like a [[Component Analysis Suite]] is very useful before equipping. Using a roster hack will destroy the Terminal when the reinforcements are teleported in after a few turns. There are a limited number of roster hacks available on a given map, starting at 2 slots on -6, increasing every floor up to the cap of 6 slots on -2. Roster hacks will occasionally be rerolled, which can add new roster types or reroll existing types. All roster allies summoned will appear as purple uncontrollable allies which contribute to [[Alert]]. The exception is any summonable [[Z-Hero|Z-Heroes]] which appear as pink, but otherwise behave as purple allies.
One thing to keep in mind about roster rallies is that they will not attack enemies unless Cogmind is close and within line of sight. This can be both a bad and good thing. It is often bad when hostiles are hanging just around a corner and the Zionites get stuck trying to get Cogmind back in line of sight and trying to turn around the corner to fight. When stuck in this case, try to get Cogmind's line of sight over the direction the allies are trying to go. However, it may be good if Cogmind doesn't want the roster allies to stick around long and get lots of kills, racking up lots of alert. It is possible to manipulate the bots to not attack back even when they are being attacked while standing around a corner.
If Cogmind is not careful about friendly fire, roster hacks can become temporarily disabled. The length of the lockout can vary depending on the amount of friendly fire. In extreme cases, Cogmind can be locked out for the remainder of the game. Killing imprint allies directly is not recommended for this reason. Instead, it is best to try to allow allies to be killed naturally if their loot is desired

Intel hacks provide Cogmind with different types of information about the current, and upcoming maps. Unlike roster hacks, intel hacks require two Terminals to use and are not instantaneous. Performing an intel hack locks the Terminal, but does not provide any information until the next Terminal is used to retrieve that intel. Retrieving intel does not lock the Terminal, however, so chaining intel retrieval with other hacks is still possible.
There are initially 4 intel hacks available per 0b10 floor. Performing intel hacks reduces the number available until there are only 2 hacks remaining. At that point, each intel hack will cause another random intel hack to become available. Unlike the fixed limit of roster hacks, intel hacks are not restricted on any given floor and are only limited by the total number of Terminals.
There are 2 categories of intel hacks: Repeatable and non-repeatable. Non-repeatable hacks can only be performed once per map. These types of hacks include map-specific intel and world map intel relating to the overall depth that certain locations occur on. Repeatable hacks can be performed an infinite number of times on any floor and tend to be longer-term types of information such as schematics and analyses. If trying to burn through intel for a specific piece of information, such as main or branch access, it is best to pick any non-repeatable hacks first. This will allow the pool of available hacks to get smaller, increasing the chances of getting the desired intel hack.
The available intel hacks are as follows:
[[Table]]

"Infowar","Part Supergroup","Infowar (information warfare) is a general category of parts that revolve around gaining additional information about the surrounding map or its inhabitants and/or reducing the capabilities of hostile robots. Wandering around completely blind is possible, but can cause a lot of bad encounters and is generally very [[Community Challenges#No Info Only War|Challenging]]. Infowar can be used to do things like locate and avoid hostiles, search for specific elements of a map such as [[Interactive Machine|Interactive Machines]] or [[Exit|Exits]], and to generally navigate through a map more efficiently. Infowar is composed of primarily [[Utilities|Utility]] slot parts, although a few [[Alignment]]-related abilities can grant infowar-type effects without dedicating an active slot to them. The largest categories of infowar are bot detection and map detection.
Infowar is useful on all build types, from combat to stealth alike. Stealth builds tend to have many slots of infowar active at once in order to completely avoid all contact with hostile bots. Combat builds, especially on slower propulsion types like [[Treads]], have difficulty avoiding encounters altogether, even with a large amount of infowar. However, infowar can help make informed decisions about combat encounters and help Cogmind take fights in beneficial scenarios. For example, one good use is preparing an [[Explosive Launchers|Explosive Launcher]] if a [[Swarmer]] squad is known to be nearby. Blindly wandering around into that same Swarmer squad might see Cogmind in a bad position, forced to take damage while spend turns swapping out a launcher or becoming surrounded.
Many infowar utilities tend to be low integrity devices and should ideally be swapped into inventory before entering combat. High coverage [[Armor]] can help protect these parts, but even then, these parts tend to get destroyed fairly easily in combat. [[Utility Shieldings]] may reduce the need for swapping in combat, especially for a faster-moving flight or hover build that doesn't want to stick around for prolonged combat.

[[Heading]]Infowar Types[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:2]]Robot Detection[[/Heading]]
This type of infowar revolves around detecting bots before they are seen through normal [[Line of Sight]] mechanics. Being able to detect bots through walls, especially at a large distance, can be a large boon for avoiding unnecessary combat encounters.
[[Heading:3]][[Sensor Arrays]][[/Heading]]
Sensor Arrays are the most basic and one of the most common forms of robot detection. Lower rating sensors have a low detection radius, equal or smaller than the primary 16 tile line of sight distance, so their primary use is finding bots in nearby rooms or around corners rather than long-ranged detection. Sensors are best paired with [[Signal Interpreters]] due to their ability to distinguish between different classes of bots. They can easily be looted from [[TF Node|TF Nodes]].
The [[Active Sensor Suite]] is a variant of the standard Sensor Array. It combines both the sensor and signal interpreting capabilities into a single part. It also provides a unique type of intel that shows commonly traveled robot paths to points of interest on the map.
[[Heading:3]][[FarCom]][[/Heading]]
FarCom is not a part, but is a free source of 18 tile radius robot detection that can be acquired by using the FarCom Aligner machine in the [[Exiles (Location)]]. Unlike most other types of robot detection, FarCom can detect only combat bots and only in [[0b10]] controlled maps. While [[Mines]] is counted as an 0b10-controlled map, [[Caves]] is notably not.
[[Heading:3]][[Seismic Detector]] (bot detection)[[/Heading]]
The Seismic Detector is an indirect and somewhat unreliable source of robot detection. Grounded bots that move generate varying amounts of seismic activity that can be detected. Wheeled, legged, and treading bots create dark orange short, bright orange medium, and bright yellow long trails. Airborne bots cannot be detected by Seismic Detectors. They can often be looted off of [[T-07 Excavator|T-07 Excavators]].
[[Heading:3]][[IFF Parsers]][[/Heading]]
IFF Parsers are a basic form of robot detection. All bots are revealed by this part, although the type of bot is not revealed. Instead, the IFF parser reveals the faction of the scanned bot. 0b10-aligned bots show up in yellow while other bots show up in blue.
[[Spoiler]]
[[Heading:3]][[Quantum Companion]][[/Heading]]
The Quantum Companion is a unique weapon with many different effects. Some effects are not present on the [[Companion Sword|base form of the sword]], but only appear in the evolved Quantum form. One of these effects is a 12 tile radius sensor effect. While the range is very low, this part is unique in that it provides infowar in a weapon slot rather than in utility slots.
[[/Spoiler]]
[[Redacted]]
[[Heading:3]][[Sigix Exoskeleton]] (Robot Detection)[[/Heading]]
The Sigix Exoskeleton is a unique propulsion item. It has a large number of effects, one of which is an 18-tile range robot detection effect. All active bots within the range are instantly detected. This part is unique in that it provides infowar in propulsion slots rather than in utility slots.[[/Redacted]]
[[Heading:3]]Robot Detection and Patrol Navigation ([[RIF]] abilities)[[/Heading]]
Robot Detection and Patrol Navigation are abilities that can randomly be gained when using a RIF installer. Robot Detection grants the detection of any 0b10-aligned combat bot within a 24 tile range when a matching [[Relay Couplers|Relay Coupler]] is attached. Patrol Navigation grants the prediction of squad movement paths within a 24 tile range when a matching Relay Coupler is attached, although it only reveals the path of the squad leader. While these abilities can detect bots with the Scan Cloak trait, they will not work in non-0b10 controlled maps like Caves. They tend to be fairly unreliable due to the many different types of bots that are present in 0b10. Having a coupler for every possible bot type takes an unreasonable amount of slots.
[[Heading:3]][[0b10 Decoder Chip [Skirmisher]]][[/Heading]]
The Skirmisher, and to a lesser extent, the [[0b10 Decoder Chip [Generic]|Generic]] decoder chips, are two unique sources of bot detection. They do not directly reveal the class or location of specific bots like most bot detection sources. Instead, they can occasionally pick up the type and locations of patrol, investigation, reinforcement, and security squads and mark them as intel on the map. This effect only occurs in 0b10 controlled maps. This effect is somewhat unreliable due to the infrequent intel updates.
[[Heading:3]][[Triangulator]][[/Heading]]
The Triangulator is an extremely niche 24 tile robot detecting utility with one major catch: It can only detect robots that are currently tracking Cogmind. This makes it unhelpful for avoiding hostile bots in the first place. However, once spotted, it can be a helpful tool to shake pursuers on faster propulsion types. This makes it unlike all of the other forms of bot detection since they are proactive instead of reactive. The Triangulator also has other effects including hostile visual range detection and travel paths, but they effects don't actively help in detecting bots. It has no restrictions on bot detection and can even detect bots with the Scan Cloak trait.

[[Heading:2]]Terrain Scanning[[/Heading]]
This type of infowar revolves around detecting nearby terrain, especially exits, rooms, and machines. Terrain scanning can make traversal through a map more efficient and easier. When combined with robot detection, hostile squads can often be bypassed entirely with a safe path out of sight.
[[Heading:3]][[Terrain Scanners]][[/Heading]]
Terrain scanners are the basic form of terrain scanning that reveal a random selection of nearby tiles nearby. The basic rate of terrain scanning is very low and only reveals up to a few tiles per turn. They can be combined with [[Terrain Scan Processors]] to dramatically increase the amount of tiles that are scanned per turn. Slower propulsion types tend to get more value out of terrain scanners as it provides more time for the scanners to do their work. A powerful enough processor can make terrain scanning fast enough to work well for even fast flight builds.
[[Heading:3]][[Structural Scanner]][[/Heading]]
Structural Scanners are a form of short ranged terrain scanning that operate instantly. When a wall is seen in visual range, immediately surrounding tiles are instantly revealed, including emergency access doors. [[Spoiler]]For the [[Deep Structural Scanner]], 3 tiles deep are revealed instead.[[/Spoiler]] Due to its cheap upkeep and instant scanning speed, it is a high value for faster builds. It is particularly helpful at locating short digs and emergency accesses between adjacent rooms.
[[Redacted]][[Heading:3]]Sigix Exoskeleton (Terrain Scanning)[[/Heading]]
The Sigix Exoskeleton is a unique propulsion item. It has a large number of effects, one of which is an 18-tile range terrain scanning effect. All types of terrain within that range, including hidden doors, are instantly detected.[[/Redacted]]
[[Heading:3]][[Machine Analyzer]][[/Heading]]
The Machine Analyzer is an indirect source of terrain scanning. It does not reveal random terrain tiles, but it does reveal most types of machines. Once any interactive or non-interactive machine is spotted, nearby machines are also revealed. If an interactive machine was spotted, the nearest machine of the same type is also revealed regardless of distance.
[[Heading:3]]Seismic Detector (terrain scanning)[[/Heading]]
The Seismic Detector is an indirect and unreliable source of terrain scanning. Certain machines will generate seismic activity that are picked up by this part. This only happens for a few types of non-interactive machines, and mostly in Factory maps. Interactive machines are never detected. This does not reveal any specific information about the terrain, but approximate room sizes and locations may be guessed based on the detected machines.
[[Heading:3]][[0b10 Decoder Chip [Scout]]][[/Heading]]
The Scout, and to a lesser extent, the Generic decoder chips, are two sources of indirect terrain scanning. However, their terrain scanning effect is very limited. Only exits, [[Garrison Access|Garrisons]], and hidden doors can be detected.
[[Heading:3]]Structural Interface  (RIF Ability)[[/Heading]]
Structural Interface is an ability that can randomly be gained when using a RIF installer that provides an indirect source of terrain scanning. Hidden doors and phase walls (primarily inside Garrisons) are instantly revealed on sight, similar to the Structural Scanner.

[[Heading:2]]Vision Manipulation[[/Heading]]
Unlike the previous larger categories, there are only 2 types of vision manipulation. [[Cloaking Devices]] reduce vision of hostile bots and [[Visual Processing Units]] increase vision of the bot using them. While they function slightly differently, they serve a similar purpose of allowing additional exploration without being spotted by hostiles.

[[/Table]]
[[Heading:2]]Other Infowar Types[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:3]][[0b10 Decoder Chips]][[/Heading]]
While some of the decoder chips were mentioned in other categories, as a whole they're an oddball group. They tend to provide intel that crosses in between major categories, while also providing unique intel like part detection.
[[Heading:3]][[Drone Bays]][[/Heading]]
Drone bays send out controlled allies to explore the map. Basic drones can only be used for exploration, although other drones can be used for combat purposes as well.
[[Heading:3]][[ECM Suites]][[/Heading]]
ECM Suites are used to end tracking against Cogmind quicker. Each type of ECM Suite has a multiplier that makes hostile tracking less effective. Additionally, the [[Alert]] gain that occurs when a bot loses tracking on Cogmind does not occur when active. While this doesn't help avoid bots in the first place, it is helpful for losing pursuers.
[[Heading:3]][[Transmission Jammers]][[/Heading]]
Transmission Jammers are used for several purposes, but generally help prevent communication between hostiles, especially summoning of reinforcements. While in range, they will prevent bots from transmitting tracking data about Cogmind to other allies on spot. This can help pick off bots in a squad 1 by 1 and to eliminate or bypass Watchers even when hostiles are nearby. They can also block [[Alarm Trap|Alarm Traps]] entirely.
[[Heading:3]]Signal Jamming (RIF Ability)[[/Heading]]
Signal Jamming is a RIF ability that behaves similar to Transmission Jammers. Instead of requiring a specific part to use, 0b10 bots are jammed based on attached Relay Couplers. Additionally, Alarm Traps are blocked entirely.
[[Heading:3]][[Trap Scanners]][[/Heading]]
Trap Scanners do exactly as their name implies: They scan for traps. Trap Scanners add fixed percentage to the chance to detect a trap each turn that one is within Cogmind's line of sight.

They are most commonly found in [[0b10]]-controlled floors, although some machines, especially [[Terminal|Terminals]], can be found in many locations. 0b10 combat and non-combat bots will interact with each of these machines in different ways. Interactive machines have a security level between 1 and 3 that determines how difficult it is to hack at them.

[[Heading]]Hacking[[/Heading]]
Each type of machine has a number of hacks that can be used that are listed in the hacking interface, labeled from A up to Y at most, called direct hacks. Hacks can be performed on Terminals specifically that are not listed by manually typing the name of the hack in. Performing a hack this way is called indirect hacking and has an additional penalty added to it. This penalty is an additional -15% per security level.
[[Heading:2]]Being Detected[[/Heading]]
As Cogmind hacks a machine, there is a chance of detection on each hack. The chance of detection can be reduced by [[Defensive Hackware]], but not lower than 10%. [[Spoiler]]Blowing up Hub machines in [[Hub_04(d)]] provides a stacking reduction along with defensive hackware.[[/Spoiler]] If detected on a hack that was successful, the machine's trace percent will start at 0%. If detected on a failing hack the trace percent will be anywhere from 1% to (100% - (hack success rate). The initial trace percent can also be reduced by defensive hackware. Once tracing has begun, subsequent hacks will increase the trace progress until reaching 100%. The amount of progress depends on the security level of the machine, whether a hack was successful or not, and the amount of defensive hackware equipped. Defensive hackware can reduce the trace percent gained per hack to no fewer than 15% on a successful hack and 25% on an unsuccessful hack.
[[Heading:2]]Being Fully Traced[[/Heading]]
If a machine's trace percentage reaches 100%, Cogmind will be fully traced. If this happens, the log message [[GameText]]ALERT: Suspicious activity at [machine name]. Dispatching Investigation Squad.[[/GameText]] will appear and there are three negative consequences:
[[List]]Machine lockout: The machine will become locked and further hacking will not be possible. [[Spoiler]]Trojans with effects over time will generally still remain operational when applied to the machine, with the exception of Trojan(Skim).[[/Spoiler]]|[[Investigation Squad]]: A squad is dispatched to the location of the machine.|Feedback: Feedback may inflict 1% [[Corruption]] on Cogmind and fry hackware attached to Cogmind. This feedback may be prevented with Defensive Hackware.[[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]Security level[[/Heading]]
Security level has different effects on machine hacking. Some are specific to certain kinds of machines, but the following effects are common between all machines:
[[List]]Hacking penalty: Direct hacks on security level 2 machines have a 50% success rate compared to level 1 machines, and level 3 machines have a 25% success rate compared to level 1 machines. Indirect hacks suffer an additional -15% success rate per security level.|Detection rate: The base chance of being traced is 20 or 25% on a level 1 machine, 50% on a level 2 machine, and 60, 70, or 80% on a level 3 machine.|Trace rate: Once detected at a machine, the trace rate is increased at a higher rate on higher rating machines.|Higher armor value: The exact value varies per machine type, but higher security level machines always have more armor than lower security level machines.[[/List]]
Security level frequency scales based on depth. At lower depths, the vast majority of machines are security level 1. By -1, nearly every machine is security level 3.
[[Heading:2]]Hacking Success[[/Heading]]
There are several major components of hacking success rates. The formula is [[GameText]](base success rate) + ([[Offensive Hackware] bonus) - (Cogmind's [[Corruption]] % / 3) + (Operator hack bonus) + ([[Spoiler]]Botnet hack bonus[[/Spoiler]])[[/GameText]].
[[Heading:3]]Operator bonus[[/Heading]]
Each allied Operators within 20 tiles provides a bonus to hacking success rate. The bonus varies depending on the total number of Operators. There is a +10% bonus to hacks for the first Operator, +5% for the second, +2% for the third, and +1% for all others.
[[Spoiler]][[Heading:3]]Trojan(Botnet)[[/Heading]]
Installing Botnet trojans on other Terminals within the same map provides a hacking bonus. There is a +6% bonus to hacks for the first botnet installed, +3% for the second, and +1% for all others. Note that a botnet will not affect hacking success chance on the terminal it is installed on.[[/Spoiler]]

[[Heading:2]]Unauthorized Hacks[[/Heading]]
There are certain unauthorized spoiler hacks can also be used on different machine types. These are a class of hacks known either as [[Spoiler]]Trojans or Force hacks[[/Spoiler]]. The names and effects of these hacks can be discovered from a variety of [[Derelict]] sources.
[[Spoiler]][[Heading:3]]Trojans[[/Heading]]
Generally, Trojan hacks have a permanent or long term duration effect. Trojans can only be applied once per machine. Other than that limitation, they are not dramatically different from most other hacks on machines.
[[Heading:3]]Force Hacks[[/Heading]]
Force hacks are much more dramatic in terms of effects compared to other hacks. They can only be used once on a machine, and if successful, they will immediately lock the machine and summon an [[Investigation Squad]] to the area. Most Force hacks have an additional [[Alert]] penalty that is unique per hack that can be found on the Alert page.[[/Spoiler]]","","","","","","","Fabricator,Garrison Access,Recycling Unit,Repair Station,Scanalyzer,Terminal"
"Intercept Squad","Other","[[Image]]Intercept Squad.png|2 Trackers and 2 Combat Programmers from Intercept squads chasing Cogmind[[/Image]]Intercept squads are [[0b10]] aligned [[Squad|squads]] that are dispatched when Cogmind gets detected and recognized in a few specific scenarios. They consist of one or more [[Tracker|Trackers]] that each summon an additional [[Combat Programmer]] upon visual contact with Cogmind. Both Trackers and Combat Programmers have [[Perfect Tracking]] on Cogmind. Intercept squads are dispatched depending on the number of tiles moved on a map. Once Cogmind takes enough moves, a squad will always be dispatched. They squads can be Enumerated at [[Terminal|Terminals]], although due to their high speed, this is relatively useless.
An alert will indicate whenever an an Intercept squad is dispatched. Additionally, the log will display a message like [[GameText]]ALERT: Reliable intel has pinpointed LRC-V3, intercept squad en route.[[/GameText]]

[[Heading]]How to get Intercepts[[/Heading]]
Intercept squads can start being sent after Cogmind if any of the following 3 scenarios occurs:
[[List]]Cogmind uses the Data Conduit in [[Data Miner (Location)]]|[[Redacted]]Cogmind gets scanned by the lasers in [[Lab]][[/Redacted]]|[[Redacted]]Cogmind gets scanned by a [[Researcher]] in [[Section 7]][[/Redacted]][[/List]]

[[Heading]]Frequency and number[[/Heading]]
Intercept squads can have a variable number of bots. Initially when entering a floor, they consist of 1-2 Trackers that summon Combat Programmers. Each further intercept has a chance of increasing the number of Trackers initially dispatched. For example, the third dispatch on a floor can have up to 4 Trackers dispatched at once, which will further summon up to 4 Combat Programmers.
Intercept squads will appear after a certain number of moves after entering the floor or after the previous dispatch. There are three possible move counts that can be chosen from, and the first two spawns are much more likely than the third one. Either the squad will spawn after n (depth-dependent) tiles moved 2 times n moves, or 2.5 times n moves. The following table shows the number of moves required for each spawn:
[[Table]]
Depths|Tiles for first dispatch chance|Tiles for second dispatch chance|Tiles for third dispatch chance||
-6|500|1000|1250||
-4 and -5|400|800|1000||
-1 through -3|300|600|750
[[/Table]]
After an intercept is dispatched, the move counter is reset. There is no maximum number of intercepts dispatched per floor.

[[Heading]]Where Intercepts Appear[[/Heading]]
Intercepts appear in the majority of 0b10 controlled maps that also have [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]]. Here is a comprehensive list of maps:

"Investigation Squad","Other","[[Image]]Investigation Squad.png|Two Grunts investigating a locked out Terminal[[/Image]]
Investigation squads are [[0b10]] aligned [[Squad|squads]] that are dispatched when a hostile presence is suspected in an area. They are very similar to [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcements]], but are triggered in slightly different scenarios, and do not stick around permanently. Investigation squads typically consist of a few [[Grunt|Grunts]] or [[Hunter|Hunters]]. Grunts are more common than Hunters in squads. They roam around the area that they were summoned to for 300-400 turns, then exit the map. Investigation squads can be both Enumerated and Recalled at [[Terminal|Terminals]].
An alert will indicate whenever an Investigation squad is dispatched. Additionally, the log will display a message like [[GameText]]ALERT: Suspicious activity at Terminal F014. Dispatching Investigation squad[[/GameText]]. Depending on the method triggering the Investigation, a different reason may be given in the alert.

"Lab","Location","Lab is a [[Factory]]/[[Research]] branch between -4 and -3 that is only accessible from [[Armory]]. This map is fixed every game, with the only variations being variations in the guaranteed items. This secret lab is used as a safe spot by the [[A Bots|A bots]] to plan and coordinate as well as research stolen [[Sigix]] technology. This area has a special effect where Cogmind's [[Alert]] drops to 0 upon entering the map.
Lab has a small square entrance and a 1 tile corridor that leads to the next main access exit and a Sealed Barrier with a [[Terminal]] locking it. There are a few different ways to get inside:
[[List]]Breaking in: The main Sealed Barrier blocking the way has 80 armor and high resistances.

[[Heading:2]]Getting Scanned[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Lab Visible Lasers.png|Visible Lab intruder detecting lasers[[/Image]]
The scanning lasers are invisible by default, although the A7 core and using the Data Conduit will reveal them. They are 3x3 squares of yellow tiles that move randomly. Every turn there is a chance that they will move in one of the cardinal directions. The [[I]]center tile[[/I]] of a laser cannot overlap with other lasers or move through walls, machines, or past the entrance of the Lab (but the other tiles in the 3x3 square can).
Being within the 3x3 area will result in being scanned immediately. This will cause an announcement [[GameText]]A0_COM: INTRUDER ALERT[[/GameText]] and [[A5]] will show up and fight. This scan will also cause [[Intercept Squad|Intercepts]] to appear on most [[0b10]]-controlled floors. The other way to get scanned is to break either the outer wall of Reinforced Barriers or to destroy the Active System Cloaker machine on the right side of the map. Other machines are safe to break.
The inside of the Lab contains many unique item spawns. In counter-clockwise order starting from the entrance:
[[List]]Big machine on top right: [[Core Reset Matrix]]|[[Alien Artifacts|Alien Artifact]] shell on top right of map #1: [[Transdimensional Reconstructor]]|Shell #2 (middle): [[Integrated Dissipator]], [[Integrated Mediator]], or [[Integrated Reactor]]|Shell #3 (left): [[Core Expander]] or [[Core Regenerator]]|Top left item spot #1: [[Deep Network Scanner]] or [[Quantum Router]]|Item spot #2: [[AEGIS Remote Shield]], [[Exp.

EM Gauss Rifle]], [[Potential Cannon]], [[Tachyon Dispersion Ray]], or [[Warp Cannon]]|Item tucked into bottom right wall: [[Gui. Remote Datajack]][[/List]]
There is also a locked chamber at the bottom of the map. Accessing it requires walking through a scan laser positioned in the bottom left corner of the lab. The Blast Barrier that locks the door has 45 armor and no Thermal resistance, but 50% resistance for most other major damage types. Inside is a machine that contains the [[LC Capacitor]].
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
Not counting the entrance Terminal, there are 3 unique interactive Terminals on this map. They will only be understandable if the Data Conduit has been used this run, otherwise they will just be garbled text. The Active System Cloaker machine on the right has some lore records and will summon a squad of [[Grunt|Grunts]] when destroyed. The A0 Command machine on the left only has lore records. Some of these records can only be unlocked if certain gameplay actions were performed this game. The hidden Storage 04-B machine has some lore records explaining the LC Capacitor and has a hack that will drop the Capacitor on the ground where it can be used.

[[Heading]]Unlockable Lab Orders[[/Heading]]
While most of the Lab Orders in the A0 Command machine are available all of the time, there are a few that have special conditions to achieve:
[[List]]Order 6-0321: Destroy the [[Cetus]] Manufacturing Module machine|Order 6-0323: [[Warlord]] must be destroyed in his [[Warlord (Location)|base]].

[[Heading:2]]L2 Power Cell code[[/Heading]]
Order 6-0319 will provide a manual Terminal hack that can be used in [[Section 7]] on the Power Cell Monitoring machine. Using it will create a powerful explosion that will destroy any combat bots in its 20 tile range.","Redacted","","","","","",""

"Latent Energy Streamer","Part","The Latent Energy Streamer uses a unique mechanic called latent energy to fire. At maximum latent energy capacity (100), the true damage potential is 90-100, with 1% disruption and +4 salvage.

[[Heading]]Latent Energy[[/Heading]]
Latent Energy is present all around the map but only in generally small quantities. The most latent energy is present in the various machinery. This means that the Streamer tends to be unimpressive in [[Caves]], but much stronger in [[0b10]]-controlled locations. Each type of machine has a different amount of latent energy it can provide to the Streamer. Generally, larger machines provide more latent energy. Attaching the Latent Energy Streamer allows visualization of how much latent energy is in an area.
[[Image]]Latent Energy Visualized.png|Latent energy visualized[[/Image]]
Latent energy will gradually return to an area after being used to power the Streamer. Generally, all latent energy will be restored within about 30 turns. Some explosive machines will either become destabilized or explode instantly when used to power the Streamer. Any resulting destruction will contribute to Cogmind's [[Alert]] level.","","","","","","",""

"Locations","Other","Locations in Cogmind are unique styles of maps to visit. The main floors (Scrapyard, Materials, Factory, Research, and Access) are always located on the same depths every run. These main floors often can be visited in multiple depths. Branches, on the other hand, are typically found on only a single depth per-run and are often mutually exclusive with other branches. For example, Mines can always be found on -9, but Storage may also appear on -9, forcing a decision about which branch to take, or whether to take one at all.
The majority of maps are randomly generated, meaning no two runs or two depths will have the exact same layout. However, the overall structure of each location type is very similar. Some maps tend to be more open with large rooms and wide corridors, while others are more maze-like with tiny rooms and many small corridors leading into dead-ends. A few branches are partially or entirely static in layout and tend to be much more predictable in contents than main floors.
Branches do not progress upward toward the exit and can often be harder than the main floors. However, branches can offer unique challenges and have similarly unique rewards that can dramatically change a run. This could be powerful unique items, special events, gameplay-altering alignment, or rare permanent buffs.

They are slightly slower than regular [[Thief|Thieves]]. Whether or not they appear in any given Caves map start is not truly random, but is instead dependent on the world seed and the number of allies Cogmind enters the map with, and sometimes Master Thieves are guaranteed to appear. When Master Thieves do appear, hostile/neutral bots are prevented from spawning near the Master Thieves' ambush. This may cause nearby prefabs, such as 0b10 outposts, to end up empty, indicating an incoming ambush. One of the Master Thieves of an ambush may appear with a [[CPS Tube]] in their inventory, though due to a bug, this will cause them to flee with their ""stolen"" CPS Tube.


[[Heading]]Behavior[[/Heading]]
Master Thieves dash towards Cogmind to try to steal one of their parts using [[Master Tearclaws]]. Unlike regular Thieves, they are capable of stealing parts from inventory, as well as choosing which parts they steal. They will prioritize high rating parts and [[Exiles (Location)|Exiles]] prototypes. Because of their ability to choose parts, they are also capable of stealing [[Armor]] in spite of the description of their Master Tearclaws. Upon successfully obtaining a part, they will start fleeing. If a fleeing Master Thief goes outside Cogmind's field of view, they will exit the map.

Despite only having a ""memory"" of 20, Master Thieves will not normally stop tracking Cogmind. Unlike regular Thieves, Master Thieves will only attack Cogmind, as well as Cogmind's [[Drone (Group)|Drones]], and will ignore all other robots unless they are rebooted by a [[Programmer]] or disrupted, in which case they may switch to a different target.

As allies, Master Thieves will try to steal parts from hostiles and return to Cogmind whenever they succeed to deliver the part they stole.

Master Thieves are incapable of taking parts on the ground, so dropping important parts you don't want to lose keeps them safe from them. Dropping your [[Storage Unit|Storage Unit]] can help drop a lot of parts quickly, at the cost of not being able to choose which parts remain in inventory. However, this strategy can backfire if there are [[Dirty Bomb Trap|Dirty Bomb Traps]] or [[Decomposer|Decomposers]] nearby, or if Cogmind or other robots carry [[Launchers]] or [[Electromagnetic Weapons]] capable of triggering chain reactions in power sources.

In order to actually destroy Master Thieves, Launchers can work well when aimed at walls next to them, though at close range the collateral damage might not be worth it if you don't have high-value parts. Targeting utilities can help actually hit them while they are approaching, and a Stasis Beam/Projector can prevent a single Master Thief from attacking or escaping while also making them easier to hit, at the cost of making them take 50% less damage. Having a lot of [[Allies]] always helps, though they are very likely to miss and hit each other in the process.

If Cogmind is fast enough, fleeing is also an option, for example to lead the Master Thieves into allies, [[Warlord]]-aligned [[Derelict|Derelicts]], [[0b10]] robots, or [[Traps]]. Internally, the game considers wild Derelicts, Thieves and [[Assembled]] to all be part of the same ""hostile derelicts"" faction, meaning those robots will not attack Master Thieves.

As Master Thieves will also attack them, Drones (even disconnected) can function as a temporary distraction, though as Drones from [[Drone Bays]] cannot be looted, even if Master Thieves rip off Drone parts, they will not obtain them, meaning Master Thieves will keep attacking.

[[Heading:2]]Limited Use Strategies[[/Heading]]
Some strategies to defend against Master Thieves cannot be used in every possible ambush, due to using up unique/limited items. Some of those strategies include:
[[List]]
[[Chronowheel]] + Allies - Before Entering a Caves map, attach a Chronowheel and let some of its time go by, then enter the map.
If there is no Master Thief ambush at the start of the map (Master Thieves may appear outside visual range, so account for that), discard the Chronowheel.
If there are Master Thieves, let the Chronowheel deplete naturally to go back in time, then enter the map again with a different number of allies. Because whether Master Thieves appear is based on world seed and the number of allies Cogmind enters a Caves map with, this can potentially prevent Master Thieves from appearing.
This strategy is unreliable, uses up the unique Chronowheel part, requires having allies and can only work on start-of-map ambushes.
|[[Spoiler]][[Dimensional Node Initializer]] - Using a Dimensional Node Initializer deploys a [[Dimensional Node Initializer#slip_node_effects|Slip Node]] at the current location. If a robot is standing on a Slip Node, all attacks directed at that robot will instead hit the Slip Node (with the exception of explosives and penetrating projectiles, which instead hit both). Master Tearclaws only deal a maximum of 10 damage while Slip Nodes have 20 armor, meaning Master Thieves are incapable of destroying them. Thus, standing on a Slip Node makes Cogmind immune to Master Thieves, making it extremely easy to destroy them.
However, due to how easily Slip Nodes can be destroyed (and the fact that they implode when destroyed), doing this risk-free requires that Cogmind have no allies using ranged weapons that might miss and destroy the Slip Node (melee allies are safe), that there would not be any other hostiles capable of destroying Slip Nodes, that there would be no [[Dirty Bomb Trap|Dirty Bomb Traps]] the Master Thieves could activate, and that Cogmind themselves would not be using any weapon capable of causing explosions (no [[Launchers]], no [[Firepult]], [[YOLO Cannon]], [[Throwing Claymores]], [[Plasma Storm]] or [[Voltaic Drivehammer]], no [[Electromagnetic Weapons]], and no [[Neutron Cannon]] or [[Hvy. Neutron Cannon]]).
This also does not work on regular [[Thief|Thieves]], as their [[Tearclaws]] deal more damage and are capable of destroying Slip Nodes.[[/Spoiler]]

"Materials","Location","Materials is the first real level of the game. These maps are small, cramped and have few paths forward. This is the first map with hostile [[0b10]] patrols hanging around, comprised mainly of low level [[G-34 Mercenary]] and [[G-47 Trooper]] grunts and [[S-10 Pest]] swarmers. There are also a few special special mechanics such as [[U-05 Engineer|Engineers]] not calling for reinforcements when attacked while trying to build structures in -10 and -9 and [[A-02 Transporter|Haulers]] not calling for reinforcements at all.
Trying to play flight or hover is not easy in Materials due to many forced encounters with combat robots, little room for maneuvering and few slots yet available for good utilities. The usual recommended way to play these maps is to grab some legs or treads and start blasting. Most players prefer not to transfer to airborne propulsion until [[Factory]] where it is much easier to stealth around and avoid combat. In Materials, it's good to fight enemies one at a time by leading them to one of the many doorways around the map. Use of launchers is very effective whenever there is more than a single bot grouped up close.
[[Alert]] is not a big issue in these maps because of the relatively small map size and number of total patrols. If making a mess of the floors on -10 and -9, entering the [[Mines]] is a good way to lose all of the alert gained from the early Materials maps.
Full list of depth-specific mechanics that apply in Materials:
[[List]]-9: [[Y-45 Defender|Sentries]] start to appear on the map|-9: [[Assault Squad|Assaults]] will start to be summoned above Alert level 2|-9: [[Scanalyzer|Scanalyzers]] begin to appear on the map|-8: [[U-05 Engineer|Engineers]] begin to summon reinforcements when attacked while rebuilding|-8: [[H-71 Marshal|Heavies]] begin to appear on the map|-8: [[Garrison Access|Garrisons]] begin to appear on the map[[/List]]

Storage Unit|Small]], [[Med. Storage Unit|Medium]], and [[Lrg. Storage Unit|Large]] storage units[[/Gallery]]The storage cache prefab can be very important early on in the game. Cogmind only starts with a [[Sml. Storage Unit]] with very little room for important backup parts and should upgrade ASAP. While not guaranteed, these storage caches will appear on almost every Materials map. [[Hcp. Storage Unit]] and [[Huge Storage Unit]] can both be commonly found on the floor in these maps, but they are not included in the standard storage cache prefab.
The other important cache is the out-of-depth parts cache. These caches contain 3 groups of 4 parts that will be one rating out of depth and can include prototypes. For example, on -9 Materials the standard highest rating part is a 2, while the cache will contain rating 3 or 3* [[Prototype Part|Prototype Parts]]. This is one of the best ways to become very strong in Materials. For example, getting a stockpile of [[Enh. Autogun|Enh. Autoguns]] on -9 can help set a combat up for multiple floors to come.[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]There are 3 types of normal exits in Materials:[[List]]Main access exits: These always lead to the next main floor, either Materials or [[Factory]]. These exits can be recognized by their distinctive 3 tile corridor leading to a dead-end exit along the edges of the map. There are always 3 of these per Materials map.|[[Mines]] exits: These exits are almost always distinguishable by a few specific prefabs of some machinery and a cache of items. Occasionally Mines exits will spawn without the prefab and look like standard exits. There are either 1 or 2 Mines exits on -10 and -9.|[[Storage]] exits: These exits do not have a prefab at all and look like standard exits. There is often a [[Y-45 Defender|Sentry]] guarding these exits, but it is not guaranteed. Storage only spawns on 1 depth between -9 and -7 and 1-2 exits can be found to Storage on that map.|[[Subcaves]] exits: Hidden behind a large area of diggable dirt where a new room is planned. [[T-07 Excavator|Excavators]] will dig this area out over time, revealing the exit.

"Mechanic","Bot Group","Mechanics are [[Wheel|wheeling]] [[0b10]] non-combat bots that repair the parts and core of damaged allies. They tend to hang around a home [[Repair Station]]. Mechanics will head toward damaged allies as soon as they are hurt but will not repair them while in combat. Mechanics carry [[Recalibrators]] and [[Machine Analyzer|Machine Analyzers]] that can be good to salvage. They also carry a set of backup parts in their inventory based on the bot tier. These backup parts will be refitted on bots if they have empty slots.
If a hurt bot is not shot at for a few turns, the Mechanic will repair core integrity up to 85% and part integrity up to 50%. Allied Mechanics will also repair Cogmind's parts up to 50% integrity but will not touch core integrity. Blue allied Mechanics must be set to Aid before they will repair integrity.

"Mechanics Achievements","Other","Mechanics [[Achievements]] are earned by interacting with and/or using many of the mechanics of the game. They are largely used as a way to teach players about some of said mechanics. Most of them will be simply eventually be obtained by players as they make mistakes and/or learn new mechanics. 15 of the 72 Mechanics Achievements have hidden descriptions that are only revealed after completing them. The borders of Mechanics Achievement indicate their difficulty compared to other achievements of the same sub-type, with more ""intense"" borders meaning higher difficulty.

[[Comment]]This warning is supposed to be there for all articles about achievement types, including those that do not have any Redacted-level spoilers.[[/Comment]]

[[Comment]]I don't know how to best categorize ""Various""-type achievements.
They're still somewhat grouped, like ""Part-time Excavator"" and ""Unlikely Earthworm"", but making a heading for just two achievements seems like a bit much.
I also don't want to just bundle all ""Various"" achievements together, because that would disrupt the achievement order given by the game when using the ""grouped"" sorting option.
[[/Comment]]

[[Heading]]Various[[/Heading]]
[[List]]Close Call: [[Spoiler]]Evolve after being reduced to less than 10% of core integrity.[[/Spoiler]]
|Universal Adapter: [[Spoiler]]Use every form of propulsion across an entire run.[[/Spoiler]]
|Hehehe: Reprogram a [[Traps|trap]] using a [[Datajack]].
Strategy: Find some hostile Traps, attach a melee Datajack, and attempt to move into one of the Traps with the Datajack active. This won't actually cause you to move onto them, and will instead attempt to hack the Trap. On a successful attempt, the Trap will either be disarmed or reprogrammed. Only the latter will trigger the Achievement.
|Wheee!: Manually trigger a [[Chute Trap]].
Strategy: Find some Chute Traps in [[Factory]] either through luck or by using the [[GameText]]find_chute[[/GameText]] [[Datajacks|Datajack]] hack on a [[K-01 Serf]]. Note that the Achievement requires [[I]]manually[[/I]] triggering the Chute Trap, which means pressing '>' while on top of a known Chute Trap (or left-click on self) to force it to trigger. Triggering a Chute Trap by moving into a known one is not enough. If possible, reprogram the Traps using a melee Datajack or a nearby Terminal. When using [[Treads]] or while overweight, the Chute Traps will need to have been reprogrammed, as it is otherwise impossible to move onto them without triggering them.
|It Was An Accident, I Swear: [[Spoiler]]Destroy 10 machines in a single turn.[[/Spoiler]]
Strategy: [[Spoiler]]Find a large array of explosive machines, most likely in [[Factory]], and destroy one of them through either destabilization or a powerful cannon to start a chain reaction. A melee weapon also works, but at the cost of taking damage. Alternatively, this Achievement can also be unlocked by accident.[[/Spoiler]]

Strategy: Find and trigger a Stasis Trap, preferably while using non-[[Treads|threaded]] propulsion, then blow up the Trap with a [[Launchers|Launcher]] or nearby explosive machine. Note that the Achievement will only be unlocked if the Trap itself is destroyed; If the stasis field gets depleted by the explosion first, the Trap will disappear, preventing it from being destroyed by the explosion. This Achievement is there to teach players that destroying a Stasis Trap causes the stasis field to disappear. Getting rid of a stasis field this way is rarely a good idea, but in some situations, taking a bit of damage to avoid getting spotted by powerful hostiles may be run-saving.

"Microwarp Drive","Part","Microwarp Drives are attachable non-consumable two-slot utility [[Alien Artifacts]] that allow warping across any number of open spaces nearly instantly, at the cost of Cogmind's core integrity equal to 2 per space traveled. ""Open spaces"" means any tile Cogmind would be able to freely move onto, which includes tiles occupied only by items or doors[[Comment]]Does this include undiscovered hidden doors? If not, what if Cogmind has the Structural Interface RIF ability? What about phase walls?[[/Comment]]. A microwarp will only end upon reaching a non-open space. Microwarp Drives can be found exclusively in the western side of [[Section 7]] as unguarded Artifacts.

Neither hostiles nor Cogmind are able to see any moment of a microwarp, meaning hostiles will not spot Cogmind if a microwarp passes through their FOV but ends outside of it. Cogmind will not be able to see anything while microwarping either, be it robots, items, or map structure, though the specific tiles Cogmind has traveled through will be added to the map as if they had been scanned[[Comment]]Does it only add ""empty"" tiles to map intel regardless of what type of tile was actually there, or does it add each tile's current state?[[/Comment]]. Microwarps always takes one full turn[[Comment]]I'm not sure if it's exactly 100 time units, but i would guess so?[[/Comment]], regardless of current regular propulsion speed or distance traveled.


[[Heading]]Uses[[/Heading]]
[[List]]
Faster movement - When using slow propulsion such as [[Treads]], microwarps allow moving much faster than otherwise possible, making it easier or just feasible to close in on hostiles, strategically reposition, or flee. 
|Stealth - Since Cogmind cannot be spotted during microwarps, clever microwarping can make it possible to go past patrols and guards without getting spotted.
|Digging - Since microwarps are near instantaneous, they be used to cross any number of dug-out/unstable tiles without any risks of [[Cave-ins|cave-ins]]. For example, this can be used to consistently get from one quadrant of a [[Garrison]] to another without having to go through the Garrison's center.
|Super-cannon digging - By combining microwarps with a cannon capable of [[GameText]]x* Unlimited[[/GameText]] penetration capable of digging very far in one shot, such as a [[Core Cannon]] or a [[Hyp. Alpha Cannon]], it is possible to dig and travel really quickly through long tunnels, and even chain cannon shots and microwarps together repeatedly (at a risk of cave-ins) to quickly move large distances by going around the complex layout itself. For example, with a Core Cannon, this combo can be used to realistically reach [[Redacted]]the western side of [[Command]] without going through [[MAIN.C (Shell)|MAIN.C]]'s chamber[[/Redacted]].

|Lower move count - Each microwarp counts as a single ""move"" action, regardless of how many tiles were traveled, which can be used to delay or even avoid the dispatch of [[Intercept Squad|Intercept Squads]].[[Comment]]Source: A Beta 11 run i did, where i didn't get any Intercept Squads in Access despite having been scanned by an S7 Researcher. I had traveled 629 spaces, but only done 572 move actions. 568 of those moves were treaded, and 5 were microwarps (yes i know it should add up to 573, don't ask me why it's counted this way).[[/Comment]]

"Mines","Location","Mines is one of the first [[Branch|Branches]] of the game and is guaranteed to appear on -10 and -9 of [[Materials]] in every game. These maps have several unique early-game rewards that can pay off throughout the whole run, but also has some very dangerous events. The assembled infestation event is a common cause of early death in runs. Aside from the events, the map is sparsely populated with early game patrols of [[G-34 Mercenary]] and [[G-47 Trooper]] grunts and [[S-10 Pest]] swarmers. Several types of friendly and occasionally hostile Derelicts can also be found here. [[Derelict Log|Derelict Logs]] and [[Scrap]] can be found randomly on the ground.

Squads of [[T-07 Excavator|Tunnelers]] guarded by [[G-34 Mercenary|Grunts]] will be dispatched continuously every several hundred turns to dig out the collapsed tiles. Using a digging tool like a [[Mining Laser]] or [[Mining Claw]] is recommended to escape quicker.|(--) Assembled Infestation: A large number of Assembled will appear and start attacking everything nearby. An [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] containing 2 [[D-53 Grenadier|Demolishers]] will be dispatched from the closest Materials exit and sent to the initial spawn location. A [[Guerrilla (5)|Derelict]] will appear next to you and tell you to run away as they provide a distraction. This infamous event is extremely dangerous so early in the game as both the Assembled and Demolishers can deal a lot of damage very quickly. A launcher is highly recommended for dealing with the Assembled, while strong single-target weapons like kinetic cannons are ideal for dealing with the Demolishers. Getting stuck between them both is the worst-case scenario, and stripping to core and running is sometimes the only option to survive. A good tactic to avoid combat is to try to dig into the walls using a digging tool like a [[Mining Laser]] or [[Mining Claw]] and hide out of sight for a few hundred turns. Usually, most of the Assembled and Demolishers end up destroying each other.

[[Image]]NEM.gif|Effect of the Navigation Efficiency Matrix[[/Image]]

[[Heading]]Teleport effects[[/Heading]]
An NEM teleport behaves similarly to a standard [[Transdimensional Reconstructor]] effect. All bots that are tracking Cogmind will instantly lose tracking, even including some [[Perfect Tracking]] mechanics. However, unlike a standard teleport, the NEM can teleport Cogmind through solid walls. This can sometimes be useful for escaping squads as it will place Cogmind out of sight in a different room. One downside of this effect is that teleporting can repeatedly trigger the [[Watcher]] [[Alert]] increase on sight, as it will forget Cogmind each time the teleport occurs.
[[Heading:2]]Frequency[[/Heading]]
There are 2 ""timers"" that can activate an NEM teleport. One is based on tiles moved, and the other is based on non-moving actions.
The non-moving actions timer will count up whenever Cogmind performs any action other than moving. This includes waiting in place, so it is not possible to avoid teleports altogether. The non-moving action timer will trigger every 36-48 actions.
The moving actions timer will count up for every move Cogmind makes. This timer is much shorter, and will occur 20-32 tiles moved.
[[Heading:2]]Distance[[/Heading]]
A single NEM teleport will move Cogmind anywhere between 8-12 tiles from the original location. If a [[Subatomic Replicator]] is used on the NEM and two are consumed, this effect doubles to 16-24 tiles moved.","","","","","","",""

Operators make good allies due to their unique ability to increase Cogmind's hacking power and detect [[Traps]]. Operators within a range of 20 tiles will contribute a 10% (then 5%, 2%, and 1%) stacking offensive hacking bonus per Operator.

[[Heading]]Patrol behavior[[/Heading]]
There are essentially 2 types of patrol behaviors. ARC and Hunter squads are fast patrollers, which navigate between their patrol points at max or near max speed. They quickly move in and out of areas so they can be hard to avoid if in the way, but are easier to navigate around without waiting long periods of time. Grunts, Programmers, and Swarmer squads all patrol much slower. They meander along the way and spend far more turns resting than moving forward along their route. It is easier to run away form these types of patrols if you know they are coming, but they can clog rooms or hallways for long periods of time.

[[Heading]]Special patrol-summoning events[[/Heading]]
There are a few special events that can trigger patrol dispatches when already on a level.
[[Heading:2]][[Search Patrol|Search Patrols]][[/Heading]]
Search Patrols are a special type of patrol that is related to Alert. These squads can be dispatched if Cogmind generates a lot of non-combat Alert. They consist of a single [[C-30 ARC]] that roam across the entire map instead of just between two points like most patrols.
[[Spoiler]][[Heading:2]][[Lightning]] squads[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Lightning Squad.png|A Lightning squad patrolling Quarantine[[/Image]]
Lightning squads consist of 3 Lightnings and an [[I-47 Archangel]]. They can be summoned in one of two ways:

"Programmer","Bot Group","Programmers are a [[Bot Groups|Bot Group]] of [[Hover Units|hovering]] [[0b10]] combat bots armed with EM weaponry and a [[Datajacks|Remote Datajack]]. Programmers will attempt to corrupt and hack any hostiles, potentially changing alliances by assimilating them. They can also remove system corruption from their allies and clear certain [[RIF]] hacks from allied bots. They are a persistent threat throughout [[Factory]] and beyond due to being sent as part of [[Extermination Squad|Extermination Squads]].
Programmers are best fought with kinetic or thermal weaponry due to their slight weakness to them. Many cannons are able to kill a Programmer with only one core shot. These weapons are ideal to use. For thermal weaponry, they are also fairly susceptible to heat transfer triggering side effects and an early meltdown. Their EM resistance coupled with their tendency to travel in packs make EM and Impact poor choices to fight them, as corruption death is unlikely.
Programmers are not initially very threatening bots. They deal small amounts of EM damage and appear only in small groups in [[Factory]] depths. However, in [[Research]] they turn into a frequent threat, appearing in larger groups and dealing significant EM damage inflicting consistent corruption to Cogmind. Having a good weapon that kill Programmers in a single core hit is ideal. For airborne builds, being able to outrun or recall Exterminations is a good strategy. Keep in mind that they are fairly fast for combat bots and have a high memory of 80. [[ECM Suites]] are very helpful for shaking Programmers more easily on the run.

[[Heading]]Lore collection progress[[/Heading]]
The lore collection contains all lore records, dialogues and their source, as well as all analyses and the general robot type they are about. All start out hidden, and are revealed in the collection when found within the game world.
[[List]]
Records - There are two types of lore records : [[0b10]] database records, which can be access on any 0b10 [[Terminal]] with proper database authorization, and all other lore records, which will only ever appear in one prefab, on one specific Terminal. There are also a few records that are not part of the lore collection, mostly non-unique records from [[Caves|Cave]] outposts that contain Terminals.|
Dialogues - The only dialogues that matter for the lore collection are textbox dialogues. Dialogue lines that only appear in the log and at the bottom of the screen with no textbox (like [[Operator|Operators]]' IFF handshake text) do not count towards the lore collection.|
Analyses - There are three types of analyses : ""Common"" for common 0b10 bots, ""Derelict"" for non-0b10 bots, and ""Prototype"" for prototype 0b10 bots. Mechanically speaking, there are many to obtain analyses, but the only way to get them in the lore collection is to hack them on Terminals.
[[/List]]
The lore collection orders its contents first by type, then by alphabetical order. However, when viewing the lore collection in-game, it is possible to export it as a txt, html or csv file. The resulting file orders its contents differently : Type first, then source (or robot type for analyses), then by alphabetical order. Except for csv files, this includes undiscovered records, making it possible to view how many records and dialogues remain to be found from certain sources. Note that if no records/dialogues have been found from one source, then the undiscovered records/dialogues from that source will not be included within the exported file.
The relevant scoresheet statistic is ""Lore%"".

[[Heading]]Gallery collection progress[[/Heading]]
The gallery collection contains all parts that have ASCII art. All parts start out as ""Undiscovered Components"", and each one is ""discovered"" and revealed upon either being attached to Cogmind or when using the [[GameText]]parse_system[[/GameText]] [[Datajacks|Datajack]] hack on any robot that currently has it attached. Inventory items are added to the collection upon being picked up. Gallery collection progress is based on how many parts have been discovered. Current gallery progress can be seen in the gallery collection.

While the majority of parts are fairly common and are relatively easy to just stumble upon or find on robots in multiple different areas, some parts are more difficult to find and add to the gallery collection :
[[List]]
A lot of parts can only be found in specific prefabs in specific [[Branch|branches]], sometimes in well-guarded, dangerous-to-access places.
|A bunch of parts can only be obtained from rare/unique robots, sometimes because the robots are carrying them in their inventory.
|Some parts can only be found on robots that will never drop them upon destruction, requiring the use of a [[GameText]]parse_system[[/GameText]] hack to add them to the gallery collection.
|Some parts cannot be found anywhere, requiring the player to instead obtain their schematic and fabricate them.
|Some parts cannot be found anywhere and have no schematics, requiring them to be created through other means.

"Propulsion","Part Supergroup","Propulsion units allow robots to move and carry mass.

Five types of propulsion exist: [[Flight Units]], [[Hover Units]], [[Legs]], [[Treads]], and [[Wheels]]. Flight and hover units are collectively known as fast propulsion, or ""fastprop""; legs, treads, and wheels are considered slow propulsion, or ""slowprop."" In addition, unlike other bots, [[Cogmind]] has a built-in core propulsion system used when no other propulsion is active.

A robot can use only one type of propulsion at a time. If multiple types are equipped, activating a unit will deactivate all units of a different type.

[[Heading]]Movement Speed Math[[/Heading]]
A bot's movement speed is based on its mass and the stats of its propulsion units that are activated when it moves. This section describes legs, treads, and wheels. Flight and hover units have additional mechanics that affect movement speed, which are described below.

Each propulsion unit has three basic stats:
[[List]]
The amount of mass the unit will [[I]]support[[/I]].
|The base [[I]]speed[[/I]] of the unit (labeled ""time/move"").
|The speed [[I]]penalty[[/I]] for overweight bots.
[[/List]]
Propulsion units themselves have zero mass (they don't weigh anything). Bots using legs, treads, or wheels can benefit from equipping unused propulsion units as ""propulsion armor,"" or ""prop armor,"" using their coverage and integrity to tank hits without increasing their mass.

When a bot moves, the game determines whether it is underweight or overweight. The game adds together the mass of all equipped parts, and the support of all activated propulsion units. A bot is [[I]]overweight[[/I]] if its mass is greater than its support; otherwise it is [[I]]underweight[[/I]]. A bot can also be multiple times overweight: for example, it is two times overweight if its mass is greater than twice its support. Items in inventory do not count towards a bot's total mass.

If a bot is underweight, it moves at the average speed of all of its activated propulsion units. A propulsion unit's speed is coded as a movement delay, or time per move: how many time units it takes a bot to move one tile if it's using only that propulsion unit. If a bot has multiple propulsion units activated, their movement delays are averaged.

If a bot is overweight, it is slowed down by the average penalty of all of its activated propulsion units. Specifically, the average penalty is added to the average base movement delay, and the sum is how long it takes the bot to move one tile. If a bot is multiple times overweight, the penalty is applied that many times.

A bot's mass and support are displayed above the parts list in the HUD. Overweight status is indicated by [[GameText]]Ox#[[/GameText]], where [[GameText]]#[[/GameText]] is how many times overweight ([[GameText]]*[[/GameText]] if greater than 9 times).

[[Heading:2]]Example[[/Heading:2]]
For example, if a bot has equipped:
[[List]]
[[Ion Engine]] (mass: 5)
|[[Lgt. Treads]] (support: 20; time/move: 160; penalty: 80)
|[[Wheel]] (support: 10; time/move: 80; penalty: 15)
|[[Sml. Storage Unit]] (mass: 5)
|[[Assault Rifle]] (mass: 2)
|[[Med. Laser]] (mass: 2)
[[/List]]
its total mass is 14. Its movement speed depends on which propulsion unit it has activated:
[[List]]
With the treads: The bot is underweight (14 \u2264 20). The time to move one tile is 160.
|With the wheel: The bot is 1 time overweight (10 < 14 \u2264 20). The time to move one tile is 80 + 15 = 95.
|With neither (core propulsion): The bot is 4 times overweight (12 < 14 \u2264 15). The time to move one tile is 50 + (50 \u00d7 4) = 250.
[[/List]]

[[Heading:2]]Formula[[/Heading:2]]
Mathematically, the amount of time it takes a bot to move one tile (ignoring mechanics for flight and hover units) is
\u03a3[[I]]d[[/I]][[Sub]][[I]]i[[/I]][[/Sub]]/[[I]]n[[/I]] + \u230amax(0, [[I]]m[[/I]] \u2212 1)/\u03a3[[I]]s[[/I]][[Sub]][[I]]i[[/I]][[/Sub]]\u230b(\u03a3[[I]]p[[/I]][[Sub]][[I]]i[[/I]][[/Sub]]/[[I]]n[[/I]])
where
[[List]]
[[I]]s[[/I]][[Sub]][[I]]i[[/I]][[/Sub]] is the mass support for propulsion unit [[I]]i[[/I]]
|[[I]]d[[/I]][[Sub]][[I]]i[[/I]][[/Sub]] is the base movement delay for propulsion unit [[I]]i[[/I]]
|[[I]]p[[/I]][[Sub]][[I]]i[[/I]][[/Sub]] is the penalty for propulsion unit [[I]]i[[/I]]
|[[I]]m[[/I]] is the total mass of all attached parts
|[[I]]n[[/I]] is the total number of activated propulsion units
[[/List]]
and all sums \u03a3 are over all activated propulsion units.

[[Heading]]Flight and Hover Units[[/Heading]]
Flight and hover units calculate their movement speed in the same basic way as legs, treads, and wheels, but they have the following additional mechanics that affect movement speed:
[[List]]
Bots move faster with multiple units. Each unit has a [[I]]bonus[[/I]] (labeled ""mod/extra""). For every active flight or hover unit beyond the first, the bonus is subtracted from the movement delay. (If the active propulsion units have different bonuses, they are averaged.) But the bonus can never bring the overall movement delay below 20 for hovering, or 10 for flying.
|Attached treads, legs, and wheels induce [[I]]drag[[/I]]. The drag from each attached unit is added to the movement delay, slowing the bot down.
|Certain flight and hover units can be [[Overload#propulsion|overloaded]]. When a unit is overloaded, speed is calculated as if there were two of that unit, and the unit's support is increased by half. Additionally, if the bot is moving at the normal fastest possible speed, each overloaded unit reduces its movement delay by 1, to a minimum of 5.
[[/List]]

[[Heading]]Core Propulsion[[/Heading]]
If Cogmind has no propulsion units active, it will move using core propulsion (informally, ""core hover""). Core propulsion is relatively fast, with a base movement delay of 50 (speed of 200%), but it has pitifully low mass support of only 3 and a harsh overweight penalty of 50. It is thus very difficult to actually use, but is necessary if Cogmind's build is destroyed or if you must core purge.","","","","","Backup Propulsion,Hover Units,Legs,Overloadable Propulsion,Treads,Wheels","Flight Units",""

"Protoforge","Location","Protoforge is a [[0b10]]-controlled [[Research]] [[Branch]] off of either [[Testing]] or [[Quarantine]] on -3 or -2. Protoforge is a highly non-standard map that has a layout much different than typical 0b10 floors. For starters, there are no standard part stockpiles on the ground. All parts are stored in specific prefab locations at the top of the map, and majority are heavily guarded by dangerous [[Prototype Robot|Prototype Robots]], including the the monstrous [[Superfortress]]. [[Recycler|Recyclers]] are also missing on the map, but in their place are [[N-04 Retriever|N-04 Retrievers]] that will steal parts off the ground at high speeds. If Cogmind can surpass all of these obstacles, a wide variety of unique parts of all types are available to loot. Like most prototypes, there is a chance they may be faulty, but they are among the strongest parts in the game.

[[Heading]]Map Makeup[[/Heading]]
The map is divided into several distinct segments:
[[Heading:2]]Opening Area[[/Heading]]
The bottom-left section of the map that Cogmind spawns in is the most ""normal"" section of the map. There are standard [[Security Squad|Security]] and [[Patrol Squad|Patrol Squads]] hanging around the area, and most types of usual machines are accessible here, although not [[Recycling Unit|Recycling Units]] or [[Fabricator|Fabricators]]. Similar to other Research Branch maps, there can be small 3-tile nooks indented into the map containing special guards. Patrols can also contain unique [[Hotshot]] [[Grunt]] variants.
One unique feature about this map is the presence of non-interactive machines that phase out of existence when passing them. These machine flash briefly on sight, but they cannot be interacted with in any way, including by dropping parts on top of them.
[[Heading:2]]Forge Plexus Area[[/Heading]]
The Forge Plexus area is located in the bottom right section of the map, with the eponymous Forge Plexus located in the center of a room. This enormous machine is impossible to be destroyed as any destroyed tiles will reform very rapidly. This area is very heavily guarded, with 2 [[AP7-3|AP7-3s]] standing on the left entrance to this area of the map and Superfortress blocking the path to the top entrance. Additionally, 2 pairs of dormant [[EXE-6|EXE-6s]] guard the right and bottom left sides of the map, and 2 dormant [[Decapitator|Decapitators]] or 3 [[SKR-2|SKR-2s]] guard the bottom center area. Furthermore, the prototype [[Heavy]] [[Overlord]] spawns in this area, although it will typically roam into the bottom left section.
N-04 Retrievers can be be created by the Plexus to pick up items dropped on the floor. The retrievers grab these items and then deposit them into the Forge Plexus. If there are no loose parts, Retrievers will be re-absorbed by the Plexus. The vault areas behind the glass walls in the back lab are safe from Retrievers, even for dropped parts. These spaces can be used as safe temporary storage.
On the top right area of the Forge Plexus area is a group of 4 Fabricators. At the bottom right is a group of 3 Recycling Units. The Recycling Machines are not used for their typical purpose since parts are returned to the Forge Plexus by Retrievers rather than inserted into Recycling Units by Recyclers. However, if Cogmind aligns with [[Optimus]] and [[UFD]], the 0bPrime attack on Protoforge can be started by performing the [[GameText]]Force(Fedlink)[[/GameText]] hack on one of these machines.
[[Heading:2]]Superfortress Hallway[[/Heading]]
There is a long hallway that connects the top right of the Forge area with the top of the opening area. Up to 10 stockpiles of up to 4 parts per group can appear here, with 6 to the left of Superfortress and 4 to the right. In the middle is an initially dormant Superfortress, a very dangerous and intimidating Prototype bot. Nearby are one or two Researchers and a [[Terminal]] containing some lore about Superfortress.
[[Heading:2]]Back Lab Area[[/Heading]]
Behind Superfortress is a fixed prefab various rooms that immediately splits into a left and right side. 1 [[Garrison Access|Garrison]] is present on the left side of the map. To the left of that is another room containing the [[Crosscalibrator]], another item stockpile, and a Terminal containing a random selection of Prototype IDs of parts available on the map. This will grant a large number of IDs, but not all possible IDs of parts. There are also 8 different prototype vaults, 4 on each side. The locations of the vaults and their guard compositions are the same each run, but the types of parts that spawn in each vault are random. The same 8 groupings of parts will always appear somewhere on the map. At the top of the lab on the right side are CX-V1P's [[Tinkerer]] lab and one extra heavily-guarded vault with 2 AP7-3 guards.
Each vault has a different combination of guards including Researchers, Hotshots, Decapitators, and [[V-Series]]. Most of the prototype bots are dormant, but have a visual range that must be stepped into in order to loot the vault. Additionally, some Researchers have a visual range that block all attempts to shoot open the vault walls by normal approach.
The hallways between the vaults are heavily trapped with a combination of [[Stasis Trap|Stasis]], [[Segregator Trap|Segregator]], and [[EM Surge Trap|EM Surge Traps]]. The top right guarded vault also can have [[Alarm Trap|Alarm Traps]] blocking the way. There are a few nooks with pairs of [[Sentry|Sentries]] at various points in the hallways. There are 2 roaming patrols made of Hotshots, Immortals, or Decapitators that go between different vaults, and 1 roaming patrol of a V-Series and following Researcher that walks from one side of the hallway to the other.

There is only one exit in Protoforge. A main access will be in the top left of the opening area of the map, leading to the next main Research floor or [[Access]].

[[Heading]]Superfortress[[/Heading]]
Superfortress is the defensive backbone of the Protoforge and sits in the center of the map. It is arguably the most powerful robot in the game, capable of regenerating core integrity and parts as well as assembling large numbers of allies in its defense. Fighting it head-on is one of the toughest challenges in the game, and successfully doing so will result in a hefty score bonus, a + on the scoresheet, and an immediate triggering of [[High Security]] unless the UFD attack has begun.
[[Heading:2]]Dormancy[[/Heading]]
Superfortress is initially Dormant upon entering the map. Sneaking past Superfortress into the back area in this state is trivial, so it is ideal to retain this state if possible. Many things can trigger Superfortress to begin powering up from this state:
[[List]]
Being spotted by a combat bot, [[Watcher]], or [[Operator]] without being jammed by a [[Transmission Jammers|Transmission Jammer]]. Note that some bots on the map are jamming immune. If the Transmission Jammer is used without a [[Jamming Amplifier]] attached, the random failure will also trigger the wake up.|
Being reported by an Operator at a Terminal.|
Destroying an N-04 Retriever|
Being scanned by a Researcher|
Digging through the outside Reinforced wall layer around the back lab area|
Beginning the UFD assault on Protoforge|
Superfortress taking core damage|
Superfortress being teleported by a [[Supercharged TR]]
[[/List]]
If any of these events occur, there will be a log message [[GameText]]Superfortress powering up for active defense.[[/GameText]] After 10 turns, Superfortress will wake up with a message [[GameText]]Superfortress completes startup sequence.[[/GameText]] if in view. After this, it will begin to assemble weapons.
[[Heading:2]]Killing Strategy[[/Heading]]
See [[Strategy/Defeating Superfortress]]

[[Heading]]Additional Responses[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:2]]Additional Patrols[[/Heading]]
Certain actions can cause additional patrol squads to come from the main exit or the Garrison. If the Garrison is open, these patrols will be groups of up to 4 Decapitators, Hotshots, or Immortals. If the Garrison is closed, they will instead be [[Hunter|Hunters]] and [[Programmer|Programmers]]. They will wander throughout the map randomly once dispatched.
[[Heading:3]]Breaking Lab Walls[[/Heading]]
When this occurs, there will be a log message [[GameText]]Research labs perimeter wall breached, dispatching additional patrols.[[/GameText]] 2 patrols will spawn.
[[Heading:3]]Infiltrating Tinkerer Lab[[/Heading]]
If Cogmind enters the Infiltrator Lab, a log message will appear [[GameText]]Tinkerer labs infiltrated, dispatching additional patrols.[[/GameText]] 2 patrols will spawn.
[[Heading:3]][[Plexus Tether]][[/Heading]]
If Cogmind attaches the Plexus Tether, all parts on the map will be identified and revealed. When this happens, 3-5 Decapitators will be dispatched to Cogmind's position. These bots will only be dispatched if the Garrison is intact, otherwise no bots are summoned.
[[Heading:2]]Lack of [[Sterilization]][[/Heading]]
Unlike most maps, Sterilization cannot occur inside the Protoforge. As a result, [[High Security]] can continue endlessly.
[[Heading:2]]Advanced Fortification Protocols[[/Heading]]
If Superfortress is destroyed, the UFD assault is started, or High Security is activated, all subsequent maps will have ""Advanced fortification protocols"" activated. This has the following effect on maps:
[[List]]50% increase in patrol density|
Patrols can have non-standard bots. See [[Patrol Squad#advanced_fortification_protocols]] page for more details.|
Garrison Accesses will be locked with no way to interact with them|
Sterilization on future maps will require double the number of kills to engage
[[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]UFD Sabotage[[/Heading]]
If aligned with UFD and Optimus, UFD agents will reduce the number of 0b10 Protoforge forces on the map. All prototype patrols, including additional prototype dispatches, will be reduced in size by 1-2 bots.

[[Heading]]Available Loot[[/Heading]]
The available loot is divided into separate pools of items.

[[Heading]]W9: ""Defending 0bPrime""/UFD Assault[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Protoforge UFD Assault.png|Protoforge UFD assault with assorted UFD bots[[/Image]]
[[Image]]Protoforge Drillbomb Target.png|A marked drillbomb target[[/Image]]
If Cogmind is both UFD and Optimus-aligned, a [[GameText]]Force(Fedlink)[[/GameText]] hack performed at any of the Recycling Units in the Forge area will trigger a massive assault on the Protoforge. Waves of UFD forces led by [[Triborg (Optimus)]] will begin to emerge from an opening in the bottom right of the Forge Plexus room. Their goal is to planet and then set off 10 [[UFD Drillbomb|UFD Drillbombs]] spaced throughout the bottom left area of the map to isolate the Protoforge from the rest of 0b10. [[Lugger|Luggers]] will be accompanied by various UFD forces to plant the bombs while Optimus remains in the forge area. Cogmind can help the Luggers by protecting them or by planting the Drillbombs alone. Once all 10 bombs are planted in the areas marked in yellow, the UFD will announce that the bombs will go off in 100 turns. The walls separating the opening area from the rest of the map will get a red highlight, indicating the safe area of the map. Cogmind must either enter that part of the map to get the W9 wintype, or exit the map to continue the run. Doing neither will results in instant death after that 100 turns. Exiting the map at this point means that a W9 will not be possible.
[[Heading:2]]UFD Reinforcements[[/Heading]]
Several changes to this event can occur depending on whether or not the civil war occurs in [[Scraptown]]. If the civil war does not occur, [[7R-MNS]] will appear roughly 100 turns after starting the event and follow Cogmind around. If the civil war does occur, the maximum readiness which determines the strength of reinforcements will be capped at a lower level. The overall strength also depends on the number of resources Cogmind has built up over time and through Fedlink:
[[Table]]
Readiness|Civil War Range|No Civil War Range||
Minimal|0-79|0-39||
Very Low|80-99|40-59||
Low|100-119|60-79||
Adequate|120+|80-99||
High|N/A|100-119||
Maximal|N/A|120+
[[/Table]]
For a more detailed explanation of UFD resources, see [[UFD#resource_mechanics|this page]].
Roughly every 50 turns, a new wave of UFD bots will appear from the incursion point. Higher readiness levels result in stronger bots appearing more frequently. Low is the minimum readiness required for the strongest bots to spawn, and adequate is the minimum readiness required for the weakest bots to stop spawning. Waves can contain the following bots:
[[Table]]
UFD Readiness|Bots||
All levels|[[Elite (7)]], Lugger, [[Scrapper (6)]], [[Scrapoid (6)]], [[Scrapoid (8)]]||
Minimal/Very Low|[[Bolteater]], [[Guru]], [[Explorer]], [[Federalist]], [[Ranger]]||

[[Heading:2]]0b10 Reinforcements[[/Heading]]
0b10 Reinforcements come in two forms: Garrison reinforcements and Main exit reinforcements.
[[Heading:3]]Garrison Reinforcements[[/Heading]]
Prototype squads will periodically be dispatched from the Protoforge Garrison if it is intact. The first time this happens, there will be a log message [[GameText]]New 0b10 prototypes are being dispatched from the Protoforge Garrison Access, destroy it to block them![[/GameText]] Squads will be one of the following:
[[List]]1 AP7-3|
3-5 Decapitators|

3-4 Hotshots|
2-3 Immortals|
1 SKR-2[[/List]]
[[Heading:3]]Main Exit Reinforcements[[/Heading]]
Squads will always be dispatched from the main exit periodically. These reinforcements cannot be stopped unlike the Garrison reinforcements. 1 or 2 squads will be dispatched at a time, and each squad will consist of 2 [[Executioner|Executioners]] or 2 [[Striker|Strikers]] and a [[C-30 ARC]] with [[Assault Squad]] contents.

"Prototype Part","Other","Prototype parts are generally improvements on standard robot parts. They can be found in many places that standard parts appear, including in stockpiles, in [[Hauler|Haulers]], and equipped by other robots.

Prototypes can be faulty, and initially Cogmind cannot tell what a prototype is or if it is faulty. Faulty prototypes can be harmful when equipped. In exchange, prototypes are generally slightly more effective than standard parts of the same rating. In particular, prototype [[Flight Units|Flight]] and [[Hover Units]] are considered essential because they have lower coverage and higher integrity than standard flight and hover units, giving them the durability they need to be viable.

The game will often indicate a prototype part by putting an asterisk [[GameText]]*[[/GameText]] next to its rating, and prototype parts on the ground will have a pulsating glow.

[[Heading]]Faulty Prototypes[[/Heading]]
Prototype parts have a chance to be faulty. Faulty prototypes are inoperative, often have serious side effects when equipped, and cannot be repaired at a [[Repair Station]]. They can be scanned at a [[Scanalyzer]] to obtain the schematic. [[Spoiler]]Megawrench, who sometimes appears in [[Zion]], can fix faulty prototypes.[[/Spoiler]]

In general, any prototype part has a 20% chance to be faulty. But the chance is higher for some parts. And in some circumstances Cogmind can find prototypes that are guaranteed not to be faulty; examples include the contents of a [[Cargo Convoy]] (but not necessarily other Haulers), parts that other bots were using, and [[Spoiler]]some stockpiles in [[Armory]][[/Spoiler]].

[[Heading]]Prototype IDs[[/Heading]]
When the game begins, prototype part IDs are unknown. They will appear simply as ""Prototype"" of a specific type, and Cogmind will not be able to tell if they are faulty.

Cogmind can learn to recognize a particular prototype in several ways. The most common are:[[List]]
By equipping the part
|Through the [[GameText]]Prototypes[[/GameText]] hack at a [[Terminal]]
|By using a [[Datajacks|Datajack]] to parse a robot that has it equipped
|With a [[Component Analysis Suites|Component Analysis Suite]]
[[/List]]Identifying a prototype will teach Cogmind to recognize other copies of that specific part and see whether they are faulty.

Equipping an unknown prototype is the riskiest option, akin to quaff-IDing in other roguelikes (and often referred to as such in Cogmind), because the prototype could be faulty. Outside of combat, Cogmind can often manage the risk. But it is smart to first detach other valuable parts, since attaching a faulty prototype can damage or break other equipment.

Cogmind can forget known prototype part IDs like any other part ID, including as an effect of [[Corruption]] or [[Spoiler]]by using the [[Core Reset Matrix]][[/Spoiler]].","","","","","","",""

"Quantum Capacitor","Part","The Quantum Capacitor (QC or Qcap) drastically reduces the firing time for an [[Energy Guns|Energy Gun]] or [[Energy Cannons|Energy Cannon]], but only if it is fired in a volley all by itself. This allows a bot to do much higher damage per turn (DPT) with that single weapon.

Assuming no delay modifiers, a weapon with a Quantum Capacitor will do slightly more DPT than 3 of the same weapon, and slightly less than 4.
[[Table]]
Weapons|Time to fire|Time per weapon||
[[CellStyle:Neutral]][[B]]1 with QC[[/B]]|[[CellStyle:Neutral]][[B]]100[[/B]]|[[CellStyle:Neutral]][[B]]100[[/B]]||

6|400|[[CellStyle:Good]]\u200766\u2154
[[/Table]]

The Quantum Capacitor has several benefits on top of firing time:
[[List]]
Equipping fewer weapons means they get damaged more slowly (but it leaves your core more exposed)
|Lower mass from wearing fewer weapons
|Only need to find one good weapon instead of several
|Can simultaneously equip weapons for different situations, such as a thermal weapon and an electromagnetic weapon, instead of having to swap several weapon slots
|No overkill: you can stop firing right when an enemy dies instead of finishing a large volley
[[/List]]

The Quantum Capacitor takes two slots, so it takes a lot of space and is difficult to swap in and out situationally. And because it tends to appear in the mid-to-late game, a build that has invested heavily in weapon slots may find the Quantum Capacitor difficult to justify, or at least face the sunk cost of extra weapon slots that will be little help with a Quantum Capacitor. The extra weapon slots can be used for situational weapons or for ""weapon armor"": high-coverage, high-integrity weapons like the [[Sigix Broadsword]].","","","","","","",""
"Quantum Companion","Part","The Quantum Companion is a unique talking melee weapon that is an upgrade to the [[Companion Sword]]. It can be obtained by either using a [[Subatomic Replicator]] on a Companion Sword or by using the Companion Sword for while. The Quantum Companion has all of the special effects that the base Companion Sword has with a higher frequency of occurrence and also has some new unique effects of its own.

[[Heading]]Special Effects[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Quantum Companion Sensors Active.webp|Sensor radius of Quantum Companion[[/Image]]
[[Table]]
Effect|Description|Frequency||
Materialization|The Quantum Companion will materialize in one of Cogmind's weapon slots within a few turns of being detached. If no slots are available, the weapon in the first slot will be detached to make room. Occurs even if the Quantum Companion is destroyed, in which case it will reappear with full integrity. The log message [[GameText]]Quantum Companion materializes via a weapon slot.[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens.|Always||
Sensors|After some time in Quantum Companion form, the Quantum Companion will develop 12 range bot detection. Unlike typical sensors, this works on all bots without a [[Signal Interpreter]], even if they have the Scan Cloak trait, and cannot be jammed in any way. However, inactive (dormant/disabled/broken/unpowered) bots will not be detected.|Always||
Surprise Attack|The Quantum Companion will ""surprise attack"" one additional target on a normal attack. Can only happen if there is at least two hostiles are within melee range. The log message [[GameText]]Quantum Companion surprise attacks [target].[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens.|Common||
Core Loss|The Companion Sword deals between 5-10 core damage directly to Cogmind's core on a normal attack. Can't be reduced by [[Core Shieldings]] or [[Defensive Utilities]]. Only happens when Cogmind attacks something with the Companion Sword.|Uncommon||
Shadow Attack|A shadow clone of the sword attacks a hostile bot at range. Can occur even when not attacking. This attack cannot miss. The log message [[GameText]]Quantum Companion releases a shadow of itself that zips off toward [target].[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens. This attack deals 70-100 phasic damage.[[Comment]]IMPORTANT QUESTION: can this effect occur while a Researcher can see it? If so, would it cause them to notice Cogmind?[[/Comment]]|Uncommon||
Bot Disruption|A bot is instantly disrupted on a normal attack. As with normal disruption, a disrupted bot can be rewired as long as it isn't hacking immune. The log message [[GameText]][target] shuts down.[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens.|Rare||
Redirected Attack|When attacked by a projectile, the Quantum Companion will redirect the attack back to the attacker. The log message [[GameText]]Redirected attack with Quantum Companion.[[/GameText]] will appear with this happens.|Rare||
Sever|A part is severed off of a bot on a normal attack. This effect can hit through the Dismemberment immunity, unlike standard Sever critical hits.|Rare||
Sunder|This effect will instantly sunder a bot, similar to the [[Core Stripper]] on a normal attack. All parts are dropped between 1/3 and 2/3 integrity. Affected by the Dismemberment immunity. The log message [[GameText]][target] is sundered.[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens. 200 energy required for this effect.|Rare||
Surge of Energy|This effect instantly kills a bot on a normal attack. The log message [[GameText]][target] is pierced by a surge of energy.[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens.|Rare||

Teleport|Cogmind is instantly teleported to an empty space next to a visible [[Comment]]IMPORTANT QUESTION: How do the visibility requirements work, exactly? Can you be teleported because one of your drone sees a hostile? Can you be teleported due to having higher vision range due to having a Visual Processing Unit?[[/Comment]] hostile bot at no time cost, through machinery, other bots and even the target itself if necessary. Also sets momentum to maximum, and can be used to trigger an instant sneak attack if the bot hasn't spotted Cogmind yet. The teleport will prioritize closer hostiles, unless some hostiles can be sneak attacked and some cannot, in which case it will prioritize hostiles that can be sneak attacked.[[Comment]]I feel like this last sentence about target priority could be reworded to be clearer, and could also possibly explicitly mention that a teleport will ignore a hostile if there is no empty space next to it.[[/Comment]]
Can happen at any point in time[[Comment]]Can it really? I did a flight run with this, and it always seemed to trigger at the start of my turn (I was never spotted due to this movement, even when it triggered during a wait action).[[/Comment]], and can still happen even if the Companion isn't currently attached, in which case the Materialization effect will be triggered simultaneously[[Comment]]I'm basing this information off of Kyzrati's ""swordy run part 2"" stream. Not sure if the materialization happens before or after the teleport, but probably before?[[/Comment]]. Be careful, as this effect can very easily send Cogmind into dangerous situations or hinder a tactical retreat. The log message [[GameText]]The surroundings shift and blur.[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens. 25 energy required for this effect.|Rare

[[Heading]]Transformation[[/Heading]]
If a Subatomic Replicator is used on the Quantum Companion, it will transform into the [[Superquantum Companion]]. Unlike the base Companion Sword, this effect does not occur from use alone. This means that it is not possible to use a replicator to get from the base Companion Sword and also get the Quantum Companion. When this happens, the following game log message will appear: [[GameText]]Quantum Companion blips out of existence for a moment, then partially fades back in.[[/GameText]] The Superquantum Companion will also comment on it, saying one of multiple possible [[Companion Sword#upgrading|upgrade lines]].","","","","","","",""

"Quarantine","Location","Quarantine is a [[0b10]]-controlled [[Branch]] off of [[Research]] that appears on either -3 or -2. It is always on the floor that [[Testing]] is not on. Quarantine is a much smaller and generally more manageable map compared to normal Research floors. There are few patrols, no [[Sentry]] or [[Heavy]] guards, and only a few special mini guard areas that can usually be easily avoided. There are unique [[Researcher]] bots that show up on this map that have dangerous effects when getting scanned. Quarantine is home to a large number of unique [[Alien Artifacts]] that can be strong equippable parts or consumable effects not found elsewhere. Unlike most maps, the ambient temperature in Quarantine is -20 rather than 0. This has the effect of giving an additional 20 heat dissipation per turn to all bots on the map. Like all Research branches, [[FarCom]] will trigger [[Maximum Security]] upon entry.
Quarantine is home to the [[Sigix Containment Pod]], a captured [[Sigix]] warrior being trapped in a cage. Carrying the Sigix to the [[Surface]] is required to achieve a W3 [[Wintypes]]. The Sigix always spawns in the vertically opposite corner of the map that Cogmind first spawns on. For example, if Cogmind would spawn in the top-left section of the map, the Sigix would be in the bottom left. The Sigix is locked behind a [[Terminal]] and some Sealed Heavy Doors with 40 armor. After opening or digging past the doors, the Sigix will have some garbled dialogue unless Cogmind has used a [[Core Reset Matrix]] first. There will be a lockdown [[Patrol Squad|patrol squad]] dispatched consisting of an [[I-47 Archangel]] and 3 [[Lightning|Lightnings]] at this point. They do not have active tracking on Cogmind but simply patrol around the area. Behind the doors, one Terminal contains the access code needed to be used on the other Terminal to open the 80 armor Sigix Quarantine Chamber.

[[Heading]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
There is one special type of machine in Quarantine called the Cryocooling Duct. There is usually at least one of these on every Quarantine floor. The map is affected by how many ducts are destroyed:
[[List]]0: The ambient temperature of the map is -20|1: The ambient temperature of the map rises to 0. All noncombat (green) bots are called to evacuate map and will head toward the nearest exit. This does [[Researcher|Researchers]] and green [[Operator|Operators]] that have already spotted Cogmind, but yellow Operators and [[Watcher|Watchers]] will not exit the map.|2: The ambient temperature becomes +20 which will apply 20 heat to all bots on the map every turn. All combat hostiles will be called to evacuate the map and most forms of squad dispatches will stop happening, including [[Assault Squad|Assaults]] and [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]]. Note: The recall and dispatch prevention does not occur if Maximum Security is engaged. After about 100 turns, 12 [[Quarantine Guard|Quarantine Guards]] will be dispatched to the map. Some will patrol around the map looking for hostiles, while others will guard key spots like exits and the [[Garrison Access|Garrison]] (if any are present).|3+: Ambient heat continues to rise +20 per destroyed machine, but no other special effects occur.[[/List]]

"Recycler","Bot Group","Recyclers are [[0b10]] [[Wheels|wheeled]] non-combat bots that collected dropped parts and deposit them at a nearby [[Recycling Unit]]. While they are equipped with [[Tractor Beams]] and [[Field Recycling Units]], Recyclers do not actually make use of these parts. Recyclers are a major nuisance for their ability to steal loot before Cogmind can pick it up. If Recyclers are closing in, fire a single shot at them to get them to run away for a while and leave your loot alone. They have the highest salvage potential of any 0b10 non-combat bot, so killing them is a great way to restock on matter.","","R-06 Scavenger,R-10 Processor","","","","",""
"Recycling","Location","Recycling is an early game [[0b10]]-controlled [[Branch]] with few active combat hostiles. The 3 ways to enter this branch are by using the [[GameText]]\\\\IAMDERELICT[[/GameText]] code at the Recycling exit in [[Storage]], by entering a Storage [[Garrison Access|Garrisons]] and looping back into this floor instead of proceeding to the next depth, or by taking the guarded exit in [[Subcaves]]. There are a few dormant [[Sentry|Sentries]] guarding hallways and several more in rooms with large amounts of rewirable bots. Unlike most 0b10 maps, more combat bots will not be summoned in any scenario. Recycling is unique in that it forces a skipped depth. For example, entering a Storage map on -8 leads to a Recycling map on -8 that leads to a [[Factory]] map on -6 rather than -7 like most branches.
The main benefits to going to Recycling are for [[Scraptown]] or obtaining the unique [[Scrap Engine]] from the scraplab. Because there are no combat reinforcements of any kind, there are few downsides to getting traced at all of the [[Terminal|Terminals]] and [[Recycling Unit|Recycling Units]] aside from minor [[Alert]] gain. There are a large number of Recycling Units on this map and using [[GameText]]Force(Tunnel)[[/GameText]] on all of them can be very helpful in uncovering the depths of many maps in the floors above. There are commonly a large number of [[Corrupted Parts|corrupted]] [[Authchips]] available for players who want to do a lot of [[Fabricator|Fabrication]]. A small army can be raised off of the rewirable bots in some of the rooms, though tend to be heavily damaged.

[[Heading:2]]Scraplab[[/Heading]]
Cogmind can gain access to the Scraplab by entering a particular dead end-seeming rectangular room. Inside are Terminals providing information on the [[Scrap Engine]] and a way to eject the Scrap Engine. Beware that releasing the Scrap Engine will count as a hostile action and cause the Scraptown exit to close and all inhabitants of the Scraplab to become hostile. This also causes [[Zion]] and [[Warlord]] to become hostile to Cogmind. One additional [[Scrapper (3)]] will appear from the exit to attack Cogmind when this happens. If the [[Recycling#Subdweller_attack|Subdweller Attack]] is occurring, the lab will be empty and taking the Scrap Engine will not trigger any hostilities.
[[Heading:3]][[SUBCON Basin]] delivery[[/Heading]]
If the full SUBCON basin is delivered from Subcaves and dropped on the ground, one of the [[Scientist|Scientists]] will drop a [[Tech Extrapolator]] on the ground. This is the only way to obtain one without attacking Scraptown, as the Extrapolators attached to the scientists in the lab will explode after death.
[[Heading:2]][[01-MTF]][[/Heading]]
If 01-MTF is brought from Storage to the Scraplab, a special event will occur. 01-MTF will try to explain something to [[KN-7UR]], but KN-7UR will say that his time is up, and they will begin to fight. Cogmind may choose to help out in the fight. If Cogmind attacks KN-7UR and 01-MTF wins the fight, 01-MTF will drop a 99 charge [[Relay Coupler [Proto]]]. If Cogmind attacks 01-MTF and KN-7UR wins, KN-7UR will drop their [[KN-7UR's Autopenetrator]].
[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There are two types of exit in Recycling:
[[List]]Main access exit: This will always lead to the [[Factory]] map that is 2 floors above the current depth.|Scraptown exit: The exit through the Scraplab will always lead to Scraptown on the same depth.[[/List]]
[[Image]]Recycling Warlord Attack.png|Derelicts attacking Recycling[[/Image]]

[[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:2]]Warlord attack[[/Heading]]
There is a rare Recycling event where the floor is stormed by white colored friendly but uncontrollable [[Warlord]]-aligned Derelicts. They will beeline toward the exit, stopping only to shoot any hostiles they encounter. On exiting the floor, a few squads of the Warlord bots will also spawn on the next map and roam around.[[Heading:2]][[Subdweller]] attack[[/Heading]]
If Cogmind visits Subcaves, then exits to [[Materials]] using the normal exit instead of the Recycling exit, and then visits Recycling later, the map will be attacked by Subdwellers. The standard Scraptown entrance will not open up for Cogmind and the Scraplab will be abandoned. Stealing the Scrap Engine when this is happening will not trigger hostilities.","Spoiler","","","","","",""
"Recycling Unit","Other","[[Image]]../game_sprites/Recycling.png|A Recycling Unit[[/Image]]
Recycling Units are [[0b10]]-controlled [[Interactive Machine|Machines]] that are primarily used by [[Recycler|Recyclers]] to recycle discarded parts into [[Matter]]. Parts are temporarily stored within the machine until full (10/15/20 total inventory depending on security level), then Recyclers process the parts one at a time to make room for new parts. Cogmind can also insert and recycle parts, then retrieve the Matter generated by hacking the machine. When entering the map, Recycling Units may already contain parts, which can be up to 2 ratings out of depth.

[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]
[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Recycling Unit[[/Lore]]

[[Heading]]Destruction[[/Heading]]
When a Recycling Unit is destroyed, parts that were in the inventory may sometimes be ejected by the destroyed machine. Each machine tile destroyed has a chance of ejecting one of the parts in inventory at the time of destruction.

[[Heading]]Rigged Engines[[/Heading]]
If a Recycler inserts a rigged engine created by a [[PSU Rigger]] into a Recycling machine, the engine's explosion will immediately go off and blow up the machine.

[[Hacks]]Recycling[[/Hacks]]
[[Heading:2]]Additional Details/Usage Tips[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:3]]Retrieving Matter[[/Heading]]
Retrieving Matter from a Recycling Unit is a multi step process. First, parts must be inserted with [[GameText]]Recycle([Part Name])[[/GameText]] (it is impossible for Cogmind to insert unidentified parts, but Recyclers are capable of doing so). Then, the [[GameText]]Recycling(Process)[[/GameText]] hack must be used to turn all parts in inventory into Matter. Finally, the [[GameText]]Retrieve(Matter)[[/GameText]] hack must be used to obtain the recycled Matter. All parts are processed at 100% efficiency [[Comment]]I didn't write 100% efficiency for no reason; not only does the Process hack explicitly say 100%, but testing using Field Recycling Units proves that 100% efficiency is 2 integrity for 1 Matter.[[/Comment]] such that, for an intact part, 2 part integrity = 1 Matter. Damaged parts grant less Matter depending on the difference between their current integrity and their maximum integrity, as the formula that determines Matter yield is roughly [Current Integrity * Current Integrity / Max Integrity / 2] rounded down. For example, an [[Antigrav System]] with 33 out of 55 integrity would yield 33 * 33 / 55 / 2 = 9.9, rounded down to 9 Matter.

[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Trojan(Mask)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]
Trojan(Mask) can be used in order to stockpile large numbers of parts on the ground. This is especially useful if planning a flight to grounded propulsion transition, as it is easy to bring parts back to this location and there is no risk of losing the parts due to Recyclers. [[GameText]]Trojan(Mask)[[/GameText]] can also be good if hunting [[Cargo Convoy|Cargo Convoys]] that are heading through the area to avoid the risk of Recyclers picking up the loot.
[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Trojan(Reject)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]
This hack has the effect of piling up a large number of parts in the area where the Recycler is located because parts that are ejected will not be re-inserted into the machine.[[/Spoiler]]","","","","","","",""

"Reinforced Walls","Other","Many areas are sealed off by various types of Reinforced Walls. These walls all have much higher than typical armor values and resistances to most common damage types. The common theme between them all is that they do not have any Thermal resistance. As such, Cld. thermal [[Energy Cannons]] are the ideal way to cut through many of these barriers. Unlike basic walls, reinforced walls will not collapse due to penetrating weapons.
There are two primary types of reinforced walls. Though they have different names, they behave functionally similarly. Orange doors block the main access to the blocked off area. These doors have a higher than normal armor value, but they tend to be lower than reinforced barriers. Reinforced barriers typically surround the remainder of the area to prevent digging in from the back side. In most maps, these have two times the normal armor level of walls. For example, an average Storage wall has an armor value of 24, so the reinforced barriers have an armor value of 48 on this map.

[[Heading]]Heavy reinforcements[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Heavy Reinforcement Squad.png|A Heavy and summoned Specialist reinforcements[[/Image]]
Heavy-summoned reinforcements behave differently than other reinforcements. These reinforcements only stick around for about 150 turns before returning back to a nearby exit as opposed to staying permanently. Heavy reinforcement contents also depend on Cogmind's speed. If Cogmind is on a fast airborne propulsion type like hover or flight, Cutters will be dispatched far more frequently than Specialists. For all slower grounded propulsion types, Specialists are the most common summon type.
Heavy reinforcements are called more frequently if Cogmind is actively moving. If trying to avoid reinforcements, Cogmind should quickly exit the Heavy's sensor radius rather than spend turns moving inside the radius. If the Heavy is on a [[Security Rotation]] and currently moving, it may be a good idea to stand still until the Heavy has moved away to try to avoid reinforcements rather than to continue moving in detection range.

"Relay Interface Framework","Other","[[Image]]Garrison RIF Installer 1.png|RIF Installer in a Garrison[[/Image]]
Relay Interface Framework, or RIF, is one of the major [[Alignment|alignments]] available to Cogmind in a run. It helps Cogmind to have much more control over [[0b10]] bots, both combat and non-combat. RIF comes with the downside of alienating several key [[Derelict]] factions, namely turning all Derelicts at [[Zion]] and [[Warlord (Location)]] hostile when passing their associated System Quarantine Field Array machines. RIF is also incompatible with the [[Core Reset Matrix]]. If Cogmind has used a CRM then it is not possible to gain RIF. If Cogmind uses a CRM after using RIF, then RIF will be entirely erased. Similarly, if Cogmind has [[Imprint|imprinted]], then the RIF will fail to be installed.
Installing RIF can be done at any [[Garrison]] by walking into a RIF Installer machine. These machines can be hidden behind emergency accesses and Phase Walls, but there are always 1-2 installers available per map. Doing so will grant several unique abilities:
[[List]]Alert Monitor: Know the ambient influence level while in 0b10-controlled areas.
 [[Alert]] is displayed near the top right corner of the HUD, showing both the numeric influence value and the number-letter classification.|Garrison Interface: Gain control over Garrison Access machines, making it easier to hack them, and also easier to escape once inside. Also automatically detects [[Garrison Access|Garrisons]] and RIF Installers up to a range of 15.
All standard (non-manual) hacks at Garrison Machines will have a 100% chance to succeed. The 15-radius detection is very handy for finding new Garrisons to enter, as well as finding hidden RIF installers behind walls.|Coupler Protocols: Use [[Relay Couplers]] to interface with their respective robots.
Use [[Datajacks]] with Relay Couplers to perform special hacks at the cost of charges on the Couplers.

[[Heading:3]]Repairing Things[[/Heading]]
Repair stations can repair most parts in the game. The main exceptions are rating 9* prototypes, [[Alien Artifacts]], Backup Parts, non-part items like [[Traps]], and a variety of other unique parts. Parts that cannot be repaired have a * next to their integrity in the stat view. Parts must first be inserted with the [[GameText]]Scan([Part Name])[[/GameText]] hack. Then, the rating-specific [[GameText]]Repair[[/GameText]] must be performed. Sometimes a part will become [[Broken Part|broken]] if this hack is failed. After the repair is initiated, the machine will take a rating-dependent number of turns to repair, regardless of the amount of missing integrity. Broken parts do take longer to repair, however.
[[Heading:4]]Time to Repair[[/Heading]]
The time to repair a non-prototype non-broken part is equal to [20 + (6 * [rating])]. A broken part will take 140% of that time, a prototype part 160%, and a broken prototype 200%. The final time to repair a part is divided by the level of the Repair Station, and rounded down; Security level 2 Repair Stations repair roughly twice as fast as level 1s do, and level 3 Repair Stations repair three times as fast as level 1s.
The times to repair unbroken parts are as follows:

If you have fewer than 2 attached parts in any of Power, Propulsion, Utility, or Weapons when performing this hack, Cogmind will be refitted with Backup Power, Propulsion, Plating, or Lasers respectively for each type of slots. While a maximum of 2 for each slot type can be obtained at a time, more can be obtained through multiple refits by detaching the parts in between each hack.

[[Spoiler]][[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Force(Patch)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]
This hack is best used to quickly repair things that have low current integrity but have a high maximum integrity. This can restore large amounts of integrity quickly for parts like [[Armor]] and [[Treads]]. [[Storage Unit|Storage Units]] are an especially good choice for this hack due to the unique ability of this hack to repair parts without needing to detach them and wait around. Otherwise, repairing storage units can be quite risky with [[Recycler|Recyclers]] stealing parts while waiting.[[/Spoiler]]

"Research","Location","Research is a [[0b10]]-controlled main floor that appears on both -3 and -2. Research maps continue to amp up the difficulty in strength and number of general combat encounters, hacking difficulty, and difficulty in locating exits. Compared to the previous [[Factory]] floors, Research maps are just as big, but are much more maze-like with large numbers of smaller interconnected rooms and big sections of the level entirely disconnected by large chunks of earth. Exploring all of these different rooms is more difficult than before, and finding an exit can be a real challenge.
Unlike factory floors with [[Caves]] available, there are usually no easy exits to dissipate [[Alert]] in Research. The natural alert dissipation that occurs between levels continues to decrease. Purging alert or avoiding generating it in the first place can be a big deal if the player is not prepared to fight off [[High Security]]. [[Infowar]] continues to be important to avoid unnecessary encounters whenever possible, and [[Hackware]] should be used to purge alert and locate exits whenever possible.
As the difficulty increases, the rewards do to match. Many powerful unique parts can be found in Research specific branches [[Testing]] and [[Quarantine]]. There are also more [[Prototype Part|Prototypes]] lying around on the floor. Using a [[Component Analysis Suites|Component Analysis Suite]] can pay off to avoid attaching faulty prototypes.
A big change in Research is the final upgrade of Programmers. The 1-2 [[P-70 Sage|Sages]] per [[Extermination Squad|Extermination]] get upgraded to being 2-3 [[P-80 Master|Masters]]. The extra Programmer on average, higher core integrity, and higher damage output make them a serious threat to prepare for. Many builds will live or die based on how well they can handle Exterminations. Look for a way to kill in a single core shot, like using a [[Enh. Nova Cannon]]. Airborne builds can instead make use of recall hacks or get spotted and run away to avoid direct combat.
Other important Research level bot upgrades are [[Heavy|Heavies]] and [[Hunter|Hunters]] upgrading to their highest tier on -2. The [[H-81 Overseer]] deals a frightening 91 damage per volley, becomes even tougher to kill, and gains a visual upgrade to 22 tiles which is further than the telltale 20 tile range of the [[Active Sensor Suite]]. The [[H-88 Terminator]] is also a very formidable opponent. The scary changes here are the upgrade from an [[Imp. Phase Shifter]] to an [[Adv. Phase Shifter]] which makes them even more difficult to hit, and the Scan Cloak (4) trait which makes them invisible on [[Sensor Arrays]] unless using an [[Exp. Signal Interpreter]]. If fighting them head on, using [[Launchers]] to aim indirectly or Treads with [[Special Propulsion Modes#Siege mode|Siege Mode]] can help a lot.

[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There are 4 types of main exits on Research floors. Most of them can't be identified via look alone:
[[List]]Main access exits: These always lead to the next main floor, either Research or [[Access]]. These can sometimes be identifiable by a 4 tile wide corridor that leads into a dead end with the exit in the middle. Otherwise, any non-prefab exit could be a main access exit. [[Signal Interpreters]] or [[Terminal]] access hacks are the main ways to identify these types of exits. There will always be 3 of these exits per map.|[[Spoiler]][[Quarantine]] exit: This is the only other type of exit that can be identified. Quarantine exits can sometimes be identified when they appear as a prefab with several locked or unlocked rows of blast doors. There are also otherwise unremarkable exits that can also lead to Quarantine. These exits will always be on the floor that there are no Testing exits on. There will always be 2 exits on the same depth that Quarantine is on.[[/Spoiler]]|[[Spoiler]][[Testing]] exit: These exits are always indistinguishable from any other type of exit. There will always be 2 exits on the same depth that Testing is on.[[/Spoiler]]|[[Spoiler]][[Armory]] exit: These exits are always indistinguishable from any other type of exit. There will only be 1 exit on the depth that Armory is on.[[/Spoiler]][[/List]]
One other type of additional exit is the [[DSF]]. These exits continue on from Factory and have the same auto-lock on hostile sight behavior. Getting inside is difficult.

[[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]
[[Spoiler]][[Image]]Research Revisions.png|Revision 17++ with Revision allies[[/Image]][[/Spoiler]]
There are 2 major Research-specific events. Both of these events can only be triggered by previous interactions Cogmind have had in [[Branch|branches]] and have major effects on the maps that they occur on:
[[Spoiler]][[Heading:2]]-3 [[Revision 17 (Alignment)|Revision 17 invasion]][[/Heading]]

If Revision 17 is rescued in [[Cetus]] and the Cetus Manufacturing Module machine survives, they will show up in a new form as [[Revision 17++]] and lead a group of 4 [[Revision|Revisions]] to follow Cogmind shortly after entering the map. More groups of Revisions will show up periodically and attack hostile 0b10 bots. Eventually, the Terminal network will be shut down, and [[Prototype Robot|Prototype]] [[Executioner|Executioners]] and [[Striker|Strikers]] will be dispatched along with assault [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]].
[[Image]]Research Warlord Entrance.png|Warlord making an entrance with friends[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]]-2 [[Warlord (Alignment)|Warlord Invasion]][[/Heading]]
If Warlord is aligned with in his [[Warlord (Location)|base]], he will bring huge groups of [[Derelict]] forces to attack Research. All traps on the floor will be disabled after 50 turns, and after 110 that the entire machine network will be turned offline, except for [[Garrison Access|Garrisons]]. Waves of Derelicts will spawn on the left side of the map, while Assaults, [[D-83 Annihilator|D-83 Annihilators]], Strikers, and Executioners spawn from Garrisons and exits.[[/Spoiler]]","","","","","","",""
"Researcher","Bot Group","Researchers are [[Hover Units|hovering]] [[0b10]] non-combat bots equipped with a [[Stasis Beam]] or [[Stasis Projector]] which will immobilize their target while active. Researchers primarily appear in [[Testing]], [[Quarantine]], [[Section 7]], and [[Protoforge]]. However, [[Investigator|Investigators]] can show up on any map at depth -3 or higher in [[High Security]] [[Assault Squad|Assaults]]. When a Researcher spots a hostile bot attacking or gets attacked, they will attempt to stasis and scan any hostile and summon a [[Reinforcement Squad]]. Investigators will scan any hostile bot whether it attacks or not. It is safe to dig into a wall that reveals yourself to the Researcher after the volley. Researchers are also equipped with anti-corruption utilities [[System Guards]] and [[Corruption Screens]].

[[Heading]]Getting Scanned[[/Heading]]

"Revision 17 (Alignment)","Other","[[Image]]Cetus Saving Revision 17.png|Saving Revision 17 in Cetus[[/Image]]
Rescuing [[Revision 17]] in [[Cetus]] allows for a minor faction [[Alignment|alignment]]. If this is done, [[Revision 17++]] will attack [[0b10]] on the -3 [[Research]] map along with a lot of friendly [[Revision|Revisions]] as allies.This alignment is incompatible with [[Imprint|imprinting]] and Revision will flee from an imprinted Cogmind out of fear of the [[Imprinter]]. In order for the alignment to take effect, Revision 17 must survive until Cogmind exits the map, all 8 [[Cetus Guard|Cetus Guards]] must be destroyed, and the Cetus Manufacturing Module machine must be intact.

[[Heading]]-3 Research Invasion[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Research Revisions.png|Revision 17++ with Revision allies[[/Image]]
[[Image]]Research Suppression Forces.png|Suppression forces dispatched to fight the Revisions[[/Image]]
200 turns after entering the map, Revision 17++ will lead a group of 4 Revisions to follow Cogmind. They are uncontrollable allies but do not generate any alert for Cogmind when attacking. The announcement text [[GameText]]Unknown forces entering zones 8R, 1R, 4T. Local Systems Malfunctioning[[/GameText]] will precede their coming. Squads of 4 Revisions will continue to appear from main access exits every 200 turns. Occasionally a Revision will shout [[GameText]]Recycler![[/GameText]] and turn hostile, although this may also be followed by [[GameText]]##MEMORY:RESET##[[/GameText]] to turn them friendly again. 500 turns after Revision 17 arrives, an alert [[GameText]]Research terminal network lockdown[[/GameText]] will appear, and all Terminals on the map will shut down (other interactive machines are unaffected). Another alert will show up 50 turns later: [[GameText]]Suppression forces dispatched. All non-combat units evacuate.[[/GameText]] After this message, squads of 2 [[Executioner|Executioners]] or [[Striker|Strikers]] and an [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] will start to appear from exits and roam the map, looking for hostiles. They will also spawn every 200 turns.
There are a few other side-effects of this event. One is that explosive machines will explode at random whenever Cogmind is nearby. This can be good when fighting enemies around explosive machines, but be wary of them when walking around the map or else they may surprise you at a bad time. Another is that mapgen is affected. [[Heavy|Heavies]] will not appear on a map that Revision 17 invades.

This event can be a great blessing or a curse depending on a lot of factors. Getting an escort of alert-free allies with other squads of allies roaming the map is great. They will clean up most of the map for you and can net some free prototype bot loot. Blocking Heavy spawns is incredibly useful here as well. The downsides can also be pretty major, however. Losing access to all Terminals by turn 700 can be very bad if Cogmind is on slow propulsion and has no exit intel and no form of terrain scanning. Trying to follow the spawning Revisions or suppression forces can lead to an exit, although it can be a bit unreliable. Another downside is that the Revisions will often create a ton of squads to appear right at the beginning of the event. Sometimes, large groups of [[Operator|Operators]] and alarm traps can all be triggered at nearly the same time. This can result in massive groups of hostiles to appear right in Cogmind's face with unlucky exit or [[Garrison Access|Garrison]] positioning.

Due to a bug (fixed for Beta 15), going through a Garrison and looping back to -3/Research will cause the event to partially continue.[[Comment]]Apparently it was a bug?[[/Comment]]

They can usually be found near [[Sapper|Sappers]], in some cases placed and activated by Sappers to destroy 0b10 machines. When Cogmind is standing on one, pressing > or right-clicking on Cogmind will start its 8-turn explosion timer. Doing so again will interrupt the timer, which can be useful when trying to collect/interrupt one from a Sapper's sabotage attempt or after accidentally activating one. Note that both activation and deactivation take an entire turn, meaning only 7 of the 8 turns can actually be used to escape its explosion radius. Picking up an active Sapper Charge will not halt its countdown, and it can explode from Cogmind's inventory.

Because Sapper Charges' explosions deal thermal damage, they can be use to safely [[Digging|dig]]. They also deal high enough damage to destroy almost any 1-layer door-type obstacles such as [[Reinforced Walls|Sealed Blast Doors]], as well as most machines.

[[Heading:3]]Identifying Parts[[/Heading]]
Identifying unknown parts is done by using the [[GameText]]Insert([Part Name])[[/GameText]] hack. This hack has no side effects if it fails, and can identify any part in the game. Identifying a [[Prototype Part]] this way will also determine whether it is faulty or not. If a part has no schematic available for downloading, the machine text will indicate [[GameText]]Failed: Components not registered.[[/GameText]]
[[Heading:3]]Downloading Schematics[[/Heading]]
After a part has been inserted, the [[GameText]]Scanalyze[[/GameText]] hack can be used to attempt to download the schematic. This process may fail to complete even if the hack was successful. Additionally, the inserted part may be broken by the scanalyzing attempt even if successful. If this happens, the part must be reinserted again before another download attempt can be made. Broken and faulty parts can be scanalyzed without issue. Higher security level Scanalyzers have a higher schematic downloading chance and a lower chance at breaking the scanalyzed part.

The total score earned throughout a run is shown at the end, after which the details of that run, including the different sources of points, can be found in the relevant scoresheet within the ""scores"" folder in the game files. From the ""[7] RECORDS"" menu, it is also possible to create a scoresheet dump in which the details of the run so far, including score earned, can be found. Scoresheet dump can be found in the ""dumps"" folder in the game files.

[[Heading:4]]Performance[[/Heading]]
The quick overview of overall performance and score in scoresheets, followed by the total score. Each of these categories is always listed in scoresheets, regardless of whether any score was earned in any of them:
[[Table]]Name|Points|X||

Regions Visited (X)|X * 200|Maps visited, excluding [[Scrapyard]]||

[[Sup]]1[[/Sup]]Broken/Unpowered robots do not count towards score in any way.
[[Sup]]2[[/Sup]]In each map, no more than 60 robot kills of a single class may contribute to score. (Additional robots are not recorded in any part of the score section, but are still recorded in other sections of scoresheets.)

[[Heading:2]]Value[[/Heading]]
Value is dependent on robot class and type of machine. Purely decorative machines and non-0b10 machines usually have a value of 0, most 0b10 machines have a value of 10, functional [[Garrison Access|Garrison Accesses]] have a value of 100, and some important machines like Garrison Relays and Phase Generators have a value of 200.
The value of common [[0b10 Bots]] is equal to their class number (for example, the [[G-67 Veteran]] has a value of 67), though there are a few exceptions, like the entire [[Duelist]] class. Other combat robot classes' values aren't listed anywhere in-game, but usually reflects their strength fairly well.
[[Assembled]], passive [[Derelict]] bot classes, special bots that can only ever be found unpowered as ""statues"" and most [[Drone (Group)|Drones]] have a value of 0. Three special bots have a value of 2000, while all unique bots and all other other special bots have a value of 1. Some of those important unique/special bots instead grant score through bonus points.


[[Heading]]Bonus Points[[/Heading]]
(This section is a work in progress, and as such is missing a lot of information, features subpar formatting, and/or lacks links. It does not, however, lack spoiler tags.)
Bonus points are obtained from a large variety of sources, almost all of them spoilery. Remember to set your spoilers settings to ""None"" if you do not want to see potential spoilers!
Unlike overall performance score, bonus score categories only appear in scoresheets if point were earned in them. Various [[Achievements]] have the same requirements as some bonus score categories. For categories that require destroying very specific robots or machines, unless otherwise noted, anything will count so long as the corresponding bots/machines are destroyed, and Cogmind does not actually have to personally destroy the bots/machines. The following is a very incomplete list of bonus point sources, more or less in the order they appear in scoresheets (a '?' indicates that the writer of this article is unsure about whether a source stacks or not):

"Scrap","Part","","","","","","","",""
"Scrap Engine","Part","Scrap Engine is a unique [[Derelict]] part that can only be obtained by stealing from the [[Recycling#Scraplab|Scraplab in Recycling]]. It has the capability to create powerful constructs by combining many different parts into one. It can create power constructs of up to 4 slots, propulsion up to 8 slots, and weapons of up to 4 slots. When more of Cogmind's slots are dedicated to constructs, they will also get more powerful overall.
The Scrap Engine can be obtained in one of two ways, with various consequences. The first way is by simply taking it from the Scraplab in Recycling normally. This will cause all the bots in the lab to become hostile to Cogmind, as well as enraging [[Zion]] and [[Warlord (Location)]]. However, if Cogmind visits the [[Subcaves]] beforehand, exits to [[Materials]], and then goes to Recycling, the map will be attacked by [[Subdweller|Subdwellers]]. In the chaos, the Scraplab will have been abandoned, and Cogmind can take the part without causing hostilities.
The Scrap Engine can create combinations of parts that would never be seen normally, such as energy cannons dealing kinetic damage with heat transfer, or 50 speed treads. Modifications to the constructs will only change a few stats at a time, so overall variability is extremely high when using the engine. Modifying a construct with a flight unit may result in a much higher speed, or it may dramatically reduce the integrity and support instead. Every part that is eaten can be a gamble, since the stats that are modified are random every time.

[[Heading]]Processing Parts/Inventory[[/Heading]]
The Scrap Engine can be fed parts by enabling it and standing on top of a part. Once eaten, a part will remain in the Scrap Engine's inventory until it is used for creating a new construct or for modifying an existing one. Up to 10 power, propulsion, protection, and weapons can be stored (counted separately for each part type). This inventory can be used as a pseudo-storage mechanism by preemptively eating a part and disabling the Scrap Engine to prevent use until later. This is more efficient than keeping parts in regular inventory, but is more restrictive since the parts used for modification can't be explicitly selected anymore. If over 10 parts of a given type is fed to the engine, the first part in the engine's inventory will be destroyed.
[[Heading:2]]Broken/Faulty parts[[/Heading]]
The output of the Scrap Engine is not negatively affected by inputting low-integrity, broken, or faulty parts. As such, it may be a good idea to feed these parts to the Scrap Engine instead of throwing them away or letting them become totally destroyed.
[[Heading:2]]Protection parts[[/Heading]]
Rather than going toward creating new constructs, protection is instead used to reinforce the Scrap Engine itself. The first time that a protection item is consumed, the Scrap Engine will turn itself into the [[Arm. Scrap Engine]], gaining more coverage and integrity. Every subsequent armor piece consumed will restore 100 Scrap Engine integrity.

[[Heading]]Creating constructs[[/Heading]]
If 2 power, 3 propulsion, or 4 weapons are stored in the engine's inventory at once, a new construct can be created by combining all of the parts into a new one. Duplicates of a part may be used in new constructions, but at least 2 unique parts must be involved in new construct creation. Note: There is a maximum of 1 power and 1 propulsion construct each at a time, but up to 4 weapon constructs can be created. New constructs are created with a mix of the stats of the original items put into them. The Scrap Engine will preferentially create new constructs as opposed to modifying existing ones.
[[Heading:2]]Naming[[/Heading]]
The names of constructs are generated from a combination of parts processed up to that point. For example, eating an [[Ion Engine]] and a [[Nuclear Core]] may result in a Nuclear-Ion Core. Further modifications may cause the name to change over time.
[[Heading:2]]Type[[/Heading]]
The initial type of a construct will be selected randomly from its original parts. This can cause unusual stats, such as treads much faster than typically seen when created in combination with a faster propulsion type like flight. Like names, the type of a construct can change over time with more modifications. Propulsion constructs gain all natural ability of the propulsion type, like a flight construct granting bot hopping, or a leg construct granting running avoidance bonuses.

[[Heading]]Modification[[/Heading]]
Constructs can be modified when at least 2 different parts are stored in the Scrap Engine's inventory at a given time. For example, 2 [[Aluminum Leg|Aluminum Legs]] would not result in modification, but 1 Aluminum Leg and 1 [[Imp. Aluminum Leg]] would cause a modification, as would 1 Aluminum Leg and 1 [[Flight Unit]].
Each time a construct is modified, 1-5 random stats (generally higher numbers for weapons, lower numbers for power and propulsion) are modified based on the parts that were just processed. Additionally, if there is a slot available, the modified construct may grow in size. The growing chance decreases as the construct gets bigger, so increasing from 1 slot to 2 slots is much easier than increasing from 2 to 3. Additionally, modifying a construct will restore about 1/3 of its integrity.
[[Heading:2]]Multiple slots[[/Heading]]
When parts evolve into multiple slots, some of the stats also scale proportionally. Resource costs always scale in accordance with the number of slots, as will integrity and coverage. Aside from that, primary aspects of the slot type like energy generation, support, and damage will all scale based on slot number. Stats that are percentage based, like overload burnout and critical hit chance, don't tend to change based on slot counts.
One unique interaction between multiple weapon constructs is the ability to merge. Rather than growing into a unique 2 slot weapon construct, sometimes 2 existing constructs will combine into a single multislot construct. The stats of both component constructs will be mixed together into the resultant construct.
[[Heading:2]]Special Abilities[[/Heading]]
Non-standard/special stats/abilities may be given to the constructs based on the type of part eaten. For example, eating a Cld. power source such as a [[Cld. Ion Engine]] may grant the ability to overload the power construct. These special stats/abilities may also be removed at random by further modifications. If a construct has a stat specific to a part type, such as overload on a flight/propulsion type, and changes to a new type that no longer supports it, such as treads, that special stat will be removed.
[[Heading:3]]List of special stats/abilities applicable to constructs[[/Heading]]
[[Table]]
Slot|Stat/ability|Part to consume|Loss on type change?||
Power|Overload|Any Cld. power source like [[Cld. Ion Engine]]|Never||
Propulsion|Overload|Any Cld. flight or hover unit like [[Surge Thruster]]|Change to Wheel, Leg, or Treads||
Propulsion|Siege Mode|Any 2 slot treads like [[Hvy. Siege Treads]]|Change to non-Treads||

[[/Table]]

[[Heading]]Part destruction[[/Heading]]
Unlike most parts, constructs are not always instantly destroyed when they run out of integrity. Any multislot parts are instead reduced in slot count and partially restored in integrity. Though the slot may be hard to regrow again, it does make constructs more resilient than they first might appear. The only exception to this rule is that a Vortex weapon construct will be entirely destroyed if it runs out of integrity due to being fired.
When any construct is forced to shrink in size via damage, fully destroyed, or manually removed, the Scrap Engine will be slightly damaged in the process, reporting that [[GameText]]Scrap Engine damaged due to network destabilization[[/GameText]].

[[Heading]]General Strategies[[/Heading]]
Scrap Engine tends to be a very powerful but often unreliable part. It can generate abnormally powerful constructs, far outstripping anything else available, and then snatch the positive aspects of them away and leave you with a weapon that generates 400 heat per shot. As such, making modifications with a lot of spare parts around is always a good idea to reduce the chance of getting stuck with a hard to use part. On the other hand, if a great construct is created, it may often be worth postponing further modifications until needed to repair integrity. Otherwise, the best qualities may be lost before long.
A good strategy is to approach the modifications with moderation. Going all in on thermal energy cannons may result in a high damaging high meltdown weapon, but may also spike your own heat generation past reasonable levels. Mixing in lower heat generating kinetic guns and cannons will tend to balance your weapons out with more sustainable energy and heat resource costs. Propulsion can be approached similarly. Eating a mixture of hover, legs, and tread propulsion will tend toward middle of the road constructs that aren't amazing at anything in particular, but you will rarely end up with the excessive highs and lows that can occur if only one type of propulsion is focused on. Additionally, being more lenient in what you eat will help keep constructs topped off on integrity.
For a higher risk higher reward approach, mixing extremes like treads and flight can result in some incredibly overpowered propulsion constructs. A primarily treads-orientated propulsion construct only needs a single good flight modification to take the speed down to close to the 40 speed range. However, bad modification can instead lose lots of integrity or support. Doing this is safer with a lot of spare parts to eat in case things go south. Another example of a beneficial extreme is combining high critical rate Hyp. weapons like [[Hyp. Gauss Cannon]] with meltdown criticals from thermal cannons. It is possible to create an abnormally high meltdown critical % weapon this way, at the risk of losing some weapon damage.
[[Heading:2]]Multi-projectile Weapons[[/Heading]]
[[Flak Gun|Flak Guns]] can produce excellent constructs due to their high projectile count. While some stats get reduced to compensate for the increased projectile count, it is still possible to achieve overall high damage and a high critical percent chance. It is even possible to go beyond the original weapon's projectile count (6 in the case of Flak Guns). Heat transfer is another good stat to apply to a large projectile construct. A high heat transfer combined with a high projectile count can melt bots nearly instantly.
[[Heading:2]]Miscellaneous Tips[[/Heading]]
[[List]]Have a stockpile of parts before equipping the Scrap Engine - Recycling is a good place to get a strong start on constructs due to the large number of different types of parts to eat, and the lack of big threats. If saving Scrap Engine for later, try to create a good sized loot pile ahead of time to get a head start on growing the constructs.|
Don't go all in on EM damage - If all of your weapon slots are a single construct of EM type damage and you run into a [[Programmer]], you're going to have a rough time.|
Be careful of destroying cover - Construct weapons tends to be much more powerful than typical weapons and will blow through walls right and left. This is good in some situations, but it can also leave you wide open to multiple angles of attack.|
Leave a slot open for a [[Launchers]] - Dedicating all of your weapon slots to constructs makes it hard to deal with [[Swarmer|
Swarmers]] or other large groups of hostiles.|
Make careful [[Storage Unit|
Storage]] selections - Larger storage units like [[Hcp. Storage Unit]] and above may be difficult to carry if flight and hover propulsion are eaten. Smaller storage units can be carried more easily without overweight penalties with a bad support modifications.|
Modify constructs with slots open - If trying to grow a construct, make sure that an empty slot is available for growth. This is especially the case for weapon constructs. Even though two weapon constructs may occasionally merge into a single multislot construct, it is more reliable to grow the slot number by keeping one available.|
Don't have more than 3 weapons in engine inventory at a time - If trying to grow a weapon construct in number of slots, having 4 parts in inventory with an open weapon slot will always result in a new construct being created rather than having the existing construct modified. It may take a little longer, but making sure to process only 2 at a time will ensure maximum modifications and the highest chance to grow a weapon construct in slot count.|
Take Alignments - [[Warlord (Alignment)]] and [[Imprint]] can both be the source of great parts to feed the scrap engine. Note that in order to align, Cogmind must have taken the Scrap Engine from a Subdweller-attacked Recycling, otherwise the associated maps will be hostile.[[/List]]","","","","","","",""

"Scraptown","Location","Scraptown is a [[Branch]] accessible through [[Recycling]], based in the Old 0b1 Recycling map, that is the home to a large amount of [[UFD|United Federation of Derelicts (UFD)]]-aligned [[Derelict|Derelicts]]. Scraptown contains many different groups of Derelicts and most have various rooms that can appear from run to run. The overall layout of Scraptown is the same each run, but the rooms will contain different combinations of groups each time. There are C-Scrubber machines at the entrance and all exits on this map that will cleanse corruption, and their use is recommended to avoid misfiring and causing accidental hostilities.
The map always consists of an open left area that all bots are free to explore. The map is divided by a giant UFD HQ Gate with [[Triborg]] guarding nearby. The gate has 60 armor and high resistances to all main damage types except for Thermal damage. Realistically, the only options to cut through are [[Plasma Cutters|Plasma Cutter]] or the [[Siege Cannon]]. However, the gate will open automatically if Cogmind becomes UFD aligned. The right side of the map contains many more unique rooms.

[[Heading]]Alignment - [[UFD]][[/Heading]]
Talking to the Scrapper standing next to the UFD registry near the HQ gate will allow Cogmind to become a UFD member and enter the right side of the map. This alignment is only possible if Cogmind is not [[RIF]]-aligned, has not taken [[FarCom]], and has not stolen or attacked the [[Exiles (Group)|Exiles]].
[[Heading:2]]Sub-Alignment - [[Optimus]][[/Heading]]
After becoming a UFD member, it is also possible to team up with Optimus and the 0bPrime UFD group in the center of the map. This has some additional benefits later in the game, but has the downside of starting a civil war if Cogmind does not quickly exit the map.

[[Image]]Scraptown Cartography Club Solve.png|Steps to solve the Cartography Club Maze (may be mirrored)[[/Image]]
The Cartography Club contains multiple rewards that are locked behind a maze. These items are a [[Mapping Drone Bay]] (not guaranteed), a [[Surveybot 17 Chip]] (not guaranteed), a Terminal filled with various forms of map intel (guaranteed), and a [[Deep Structural Scanner]] (guaranteed). In order to perform steps 4-6, Cogmind must be at least 50 speed. A grounded bot can temporarily purge items in order to complete the puzzle, as core hover is enough speed.
The maze may mirrored horizontally from the example image. The following steps will solve the maze:
[[List]]1: From the entrance, step toward the terminal. A wall will rise in front of Cogmind.|2: From the Terminal, follow the path left path, bypassing an Explorer blocking the path.

[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading:2]]
There are two exits from Scraptown, one in the upper-left area and one in the upper-right corner. If Scraptown is on -7, these exits lead to the -5 [[Factory]] map. Otherwise, these exits lead to the -6 Factory map.

[[Heading]]Civil War[[/Heading]]
If Cogmind talks to Optimus, a civil war will eventually happen if Cogmind remains on the map. Optimus will have dialogue 30 and 80 turns after talking, indicating that Cogmind shouldn't stick around too long. After 400 turns or 72 moves, whichever happens sooner, a cutscene will reveal that Optimus has a secret plan that puts Scraptown in danger.
After the civil war has started, about half of the assorted UFD bots will align with 0bPrime and the rest will be hostile to 0bPrime bots (including Optimus and all [[Elite (4)|Elites]]) and Cogmind. During this war, Cogmind is free to smash walls and collect loot on the map.
[[Heading:2]]Civil War Looting[[/Heading]]
The civil war is a great time to loot the various parts on the map that are normally locked  behind aggro. Cogmind can freely kill any hostile bots and dig through walls without penalty. Nearly all parts are available during the civil war, although IN-MT5's Pitchfork schematic cannot be acquired using this method.

[[Heading]]Hostilities[[/Heading]]
The UFD is typically friendly to Cogmind but will turn hostile if Cogmind attacks a bot or digs through any dirt or machine tiles. There are a large amount of bots that will turn hostile to Cogmind, so attacking should not be done lightly. If Cogmind is capable of taking down all of its inhabitants, there are a large number of unique items that are only available by attacking Scraptown.
[[Heading:2]]Attack Mechanics[[/Heading]]
After Cogmind either attacks a bot or destroys a wall or machine tile, every UFD bot will turn hostile to Cogmind with the message [[GameText]]Intruder alert! Defend Scraptown![[/GameText]]. When this happens, the HQ gate will open up by 2 tiles, non-combat bots like [[Scientist|Scientists]] will begin to exit the map, and combat bots will start heading to the center of the map. After that, certain events will occur in a predictable fashion:
[[List]]
~100 turns: 4 [[Scrapper (3)|Scrappers]] will come from the left exit and guard it.|
~105 turns: The message [[GameText]]Triborg tracking relay activated. Stay clear or you only have yourself to blame![[/GameText]] appears. Triborg will gain tracking on Cogmind and pursue throughout the map. A small group of other combat bots will follow along with him. Triborg will shoot through walls like a [[Behemoth]], so hiding is not particularly effective|
~400-600 turns: The message [[GameText]]HQ reinforcements inbound. Hold Tight![[/GameText]] will appear. When this happens, Optimus will gain tracking on Cogmind. About 25 various combat bots will trail after him.|
+100 turns (~500-700 turns): Reinforcements will start to appear from exits on the left and right sides of the map. A large group of bots will appear instantly, and more will trickle onto the map over time. These bots travel in groups like [[Patrol Squad|Patrol Squads]].
|+250 turns (~750-950 turns): The message [[GameText]]Sorry everyone, if you're still alive to receive this, we've run out of nearby reinforcements. Consider running and hiding![[/GameText]]

"Search Patrol","Other","Search patrols are a unique type of [[0b10]] aligned [[Patrol Squad|patrol squad]]. They can be dispatched if Cogmind generates a lot of [[Alert]] from non-combat sources. This is primarily caused by being spotted by [[Watcher|Watchers]] or [[N-01 Spotter|Spotters]], guard bots like [[Sentry|Sentries]], or by being spotted by any combat hostile and then running away and losing tracking. If the Alert level is above the typical [[Assault Squad|Assault]] range of level 2/400 influence and Cogmind has gained the majority of the influence from these non-combat sources, there is a chance that one or more search patrols may be dispatched. If a search patrol is announced, influence will drop by 150. This will be accompanied by the alert [[GameText]]ALERT: Heightened foreign activity detected, dispatching search patrol.[[/GameText]] The alert will also indicate if multiple search patrols are to be sent out simultaneously. One or more ARCs will be dispatched after a few more turns. These ARCs behave similarly as regular patrol ARCs and have the same standard patrol contents within them. However, search squads will choose random points on the map to patrol to rather than having a fixed patrol route like all other patrols.","","","","","","",""
"Section 7","Location","Section 7 is a [[0b10]]-controlled [[Research]] [[Branch]] off of either [[Testing]] or [[Quarantine]] on -3 or -2.

However, the [[Alien Artifacts|Alien Artifact]] unique parts can be quite gamechanging and can include effects like strong weaponry, part integrity regeneration effects, and permanent buffs to Cogmind for the remainder of the game. This map is also home to powerful [[S7 Guard|S7 Guards]] that guard some of the more powerful and unique Artifacts. 
The left side of the map is different each run, but the right half, the ""hangar"", is always static. The hangar primarily contains large pieces of machinery used for the construction of a ship based after the Leopard, the [[Sigix]] ship that attacked 0b10. It also contains various Alien Artifacts, an LRC cache containing related Artifacts and is where LRC versions are tested, and several dormant prototype bot guards. The top section of this area is locked by Sealed Heavy Doors with 50 armor and strong resistances to all major damage types except for thermal damage.

Some Section 7 hangar artifacts have fixed possibilities, but there are many prefabs that have a random selection of parts available.[[Heading:3]]Unguarded Alien Artifacts[[/Heading]]These Artifacts can be present in Suspension Chambers on the left side of the map with no S7 Guards.

[[Heading:3]]Fixed Hangar Artifacts[[/Heading]]
There are 3 sections on the top of the map with fixed spawns. The top left chamber can contain 1-3 Terrabombs. The chamber just to the right of that contains 1-4 [[Transdimensional Reconstructor|Normal]] or [[Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor|Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructors]]. Next on the right is a chamber with a guaranteed [[Drained L-Cannon]] and 0-2 [[Matter Drive|Matter Drives]]. On the far right, hidden behind a large mass of machinery, is a room with 1-3 [[Sigix Sheargun|Sigix Shearguns]] and rarely a [[Sigix Shearcannon]] in the chamber below guarded by a [[Watcher]] and two dormant [[Striker|Strikers]] on the inside, and a further two on the outside. All will be awoken by the Watcher.
[[Heading:3]]LRC Lab[[/Heading]]There are 2 different groups of Alien Artifact spawns in the LRC lab. The Suspension Chambers on the top-right side and the top-left side of the map share a single pool of items. The left side can have anywhere from 1-3 copies of the same Artifact. Neither are guaranteed, but choose from the following pool of items:

[[Heading:3]][[Sigix Exoskeleton]][[/Heading]]The room at the bottom right of the map is the Exoskeleton. There is a Terminal on the right and the unpowered Exoskeleton at the bottom behind a Suspension Chamber. The Exoskeleton can become the [[Sigix Warrior]] when the [[Sigix Containment Pod]] is carried from Quarantine into this chamber and the Activate Exoskeleton hack is performed. The Warrior will follow Cogmind as a normal ally and can be used for the W3 [[Wintypes|Wintype]]. When fighting, the Sigix Warrior will sometimes log the message [[GameText]]Synergy achieved. Target locked: {target}[[/GameText]]. When this occurs, both the Warrior and Cogmind will gain a 15% targeting bonus against the target.
If a [[Core Reset Matrix]] is used, the log message [[GameText]]Sigix Exoskeleton lights up in response to your presence[[/GameText]], and attempting to walk into it will add [[GameText]]Exoskeleton opens, ready for integration override sequence[[/GameText]]. Repeating the movement will force Cogmind into the Exoskeleton and strip all parts. Cogmind will receive innate buffs to energy storage, energy generation, and heat dissipation depending on how many slots were ""consumed"" as a part of this process. The final slot distribution is 1 power slot, 3 propulsion slots (with an nondetachable Sigix Exoskeleton part), 3 utility slots, and 2 weapon slots that are filled with (detachable) Sigix Shearguns. Evolution can occur as normal from this point on. Most parts will be well protected with the extremely high coverage of the Exoskeleton, but as a tradeoff Cogmind takes 25% of all damage dealt to the Exoskeleton additionally as core damage. Some additional benefits are an 18-radius perfect robot, terrain, and item detection info, a distance from exit indicator, and spawns of [[Assembled (7)|Assembled]] from the ground in main 0b10 floors and [[Command]].
If either Cogmind wearing the Exoskeleton or the Sigix Warrior are spotted by a hostile, [[Maximum Security]] will immediately be engaged.
[[Heading:3]]Power Cell[[/Heading]]
One of the machines in the hangar is the Power Cell. It is a heavily armored and extremely explosive machine, with a 20 radius 250 entropic damage explosion that will instantly destroy all hostiles in range. One of the [[Lab]] orders that are accessible when using the [[Data Conduit]] will provide a manual explosion code. The Power Cell Monitoring Terminal will accept this code and start a 20 turn countdown before the machine explodes.
[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]

Security bots tend to be guarding busy exits, corridors, [[Interactive Machine|interactive machines]], and part stockpiles. These squads are primary composed of [[Behemoth|Behemoths]], [[Heavy|Heavies]], and [[Sentry|Sentries]]. They tend to be present on the map when Cogmind enters, and don't appear in greater numbers as time goes on. The main exception to this is Heavies, which may be replenished by the [[Security Rotation]] event, although there will typically never be more than the initial number of Heavies on a map. Security squads can be Enumerated at [[Terminal|Terminals]], but only within a very limited radius of 20 tiles.

"Seismic Detector","Part","The Seismic Detector is an unusual piece of [[Infowar]] that can detect nearby seismic activity with a radius of 22. In-game, this is represented by flashing orange to yellow colors. More intense activity is indicated by a bright yellow color, while less intense activity fades down to a dark orange. There are several major components of seismic activity that can be detected with this part:
[[List]]
Robot movement detection: Bots that move on [[Wheels]], [[Legs]], or [[Treads]] will cause varying amounts of seismic activity. Wheel movement is indicated by dark orange color and is typically only 1-2 tiles long. Leg movement is indicated by a bright orange color and can typically be 2-4 tiles long. Tread movement is indicated by a bright yellow color and is typically 3-4 tiles long. Bots that are [[Hover Unit|hovering]], [[Flight Unit|flying]], or not moving do not create any seismic activity.|
Active machine detection: Certain machines create seismic activity. Note that [[Interactive Machine|Interactive Machines]] such as [[Terminal|Terminals]] do not create any seismic activity, but many non-interactive machines do, especially in [[Factory]].
[[Comment]]TODO: Could make a full list of machines that can be detected.[[/Comment]]|
Explosion detection: Explosions create very large areas of intense bright yellow seismic activity.[[/List]]
[[Image]]Seismic Detector Activating.webp|The Seismic Detector being activated[[/Image]]

[[Heading]]Analysis[[/Heading]]
Seismic Detector can be used both as a primary yet somewhat limited source of infowar or with a combination of other infowar parts effectively.
[[Heading:2]]Pros/Cons[[/Heading]]
[[List]](+) Swappable single slot: Other sources of infowar such as [[Sensor Arrays]] and [[Terrain Scanners]] can take 2 slots to use to maximum effectiveness, while the Seismic Detector only requires 1 slot and can be easily swapped during combat.|
(+) Long range: 22 range is one of the largest ranges of infowar in the game for bot detection in the game and is 6 tiles longer than the default sight range.|
(+) Machine detection (sometimes): While inconsistent at best, the Seismic Detector can occasionally give a rough idea of the size and position of rooms due to seismic activity-generating machines inside of them.|
(+) Non-jammability: Unlike Sensor Arrays, Seismic Detectors can't be jammed by [[Watcher|Watchers]] or [[Heavy|Heavies]] and is also immune to the map-wide scrambling effect of the Phase Generator in [[Garrison|Garrisons]] and [[Command]].|
(+) Detection of [[Investigation Squad|Investigation]] and [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcement Squads]]: Since these squads typically contain all grounded bots like [[Grunt|Grunts]] and [[Hunter|Hunters]], these squads can be detected and avoided from far away.|
(-) Difficulty to decipher: It takes some time to learn how to interpret seismic readings. It is also hard to keep track of all the movement going on in busy areas. ARCs can often blend in with non-combat wheeled bots.|
(-) Inability to detect hovering/flying bots: While the Seismic Detector can point out squads of grounded bots including [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]] in [[Patrol Squad|Patrol Squads]], it will fail to detect other common [[Programmer]] or [[Swarmer]] patrol squads. Other problematic bots that will fail to be detected are Watchers and [[Operator|Operators]].|(-) Inability to detect guards: [[Sentry|Sentries]], [[Behemoth|Behemoths]], and other types of [[Security Squad|Security Squads]] are all immobile under normal circumstances and cannot be detected.[[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]General Strategy/Usage[[/Heading]]
If being used as the main source of bot detection, Cogmind should be prepared to deal with bots that the Seismic Detector can't detect. Swarmers, Programmers, Sentries, and Behemoths are the primary combat bots that fall under this category. While most of these bots are fairly common to encounter anyway, lack of Behemoth detection is a major shortcoming. Combat builds are typically more suited than stealth builds to handle its limitations as a solo infowar part. While the bot detection is quite powerful, absolute stealth is not an option. For flight especially, running into Programmers and Swarmers unexpectedly can often lead to dangerous situations.
The Seismic Detector is very good at helping Cogmind avoid Investigations and Reinforcements. [[Spoiler]]The downside of Force hacks summoning an Investigation squad is less of a downside if the Investigation can be avoided. [[UFD]] alignment often wants to perform a lot of Force hacks, so Seismic Detector makes a good combo.[[/Spoiler]]
[[Heading:3]]Good Part Combos[[/Heading]]
Some other infowar utilities have traits that synergize well with the Seismic Detector.
[[Heading:4]]Sensor Arrays[[/Heading]]
While it may seem redundant, Seismic Detector can be paired effectively with Sensor Arrays, both with or without [[Signal Interpreters]]. In both cases, Seismic Detector boasts a superior range and an inability to be jammed or scrambled.
Seismic Detector and interpreter-less sensors can cover large weaknesses of each other. Normally, an interpreter with a high enough rating is required to detect Hunters. However, if a bot shows up with seismic activity but not on the sensor, it is either within a Heavy's jamming range or a Hunter. Conversely, bots that show up on sensors but not the Seismic Detector are either hovering or flying or are stationary. All bots are detectable with this combination of 2 parts, and both utilities both be swapped off during combat. One downside of this combo is that the class of bots is never known for certain and must be guessed based on behavior.
For sensors with an interpreter, there is still one advantage of Seismic Detector that is worth mention. [[H-88 Terminator|H-88 Terminators]] are a particular scary bot to fight and are found in large numbers in -2 and -1. They require an [[Exp. Signal Interpreter]] to be seen on sensors, which is a rare part to find on the ground. The Seismic Detector will detect these Hunters as long as they are moving.
[[Heading:4]]Terrain Scanners[[/Heading]]
One of the biggest weaknesses of the Seismic Scanner is the inability to detect Sentries and Behemoths. Since their positions are fixed and often buried in a nook within walls, good terrain scanning can locate these bots even when the Seismic Detector cannot. This requires a decently rated [[Terrain Scan Processors|Terrain Scan Processor]] as the base scanning speed is too low to consistently locate these spots.
[[Heading:4]][[Transmission Jammers]][[/Heading]]
While Transmission Jammers are universally useful, being able to jam Watchers is particularly useful since many bot types may not always be detected ahead of time, avoiding scenarios where a Watcher alerts a yet unnoticed Behemoth or nearby squad.
[[Heading:4]][[Cloaking Device|Cloaking Devices]]/[[Visual Processing Units]][[/Heading]]
Both of these parts serve a similar effect in terms of Seismic Detector synergy. Having a sight advantage can allow Cogmind to visually spot bots that the Seismic Detector wouldn't pick up. The bots can then either be fought or avoided after their location has been identified.

"Sentry","Bot Group","Sentries are a [[Bot Groups|Bot Group]] or [[Armor|armored]] [[Treads|treaded]] [[0b10]] bots that stand guard around exits, main corridors, and side rooms with machines or item stockpiles inside them. They wield dual Kinetic and Thermal guns at each tier. Sentries tend to be slightly more durable than most other bots at their depth. Sentries typically stand guard alone as a [[Security Squad]].
Sentries have no particular weakness, and so most weapon types can be used to dispatch them. Electromagnetic damage is efficient at killing the higher tier bots, and EM is good in general at increasing the chances of looting their treads and armor.
While combat bots will want (or will be forced) to fight Sentries head-on, airborne builds may want to avoid them or at least avoid getting shot by them. One way to do this is to use a [[Terminology#Partial Spot|partial spot]] to lure the Sentry out of their position. After that, Cogmind may be able to use the guarded machine or exit, or grab the loot without being spotted. A fast Cogmind may also be able to use the long memory of Sentries to their advantage while being spotted regularly. It is possible to lead Sentries far out of position and then leave them in the dust to grab their guarded loot.

The Sigix Exoskeleton is an [[Alien Artifacts|Alien Artifact]] that is only found in [[Section 7]]. Initially it is found on an unpowered [[Sigix Warrior]] named Sigix Exoskeleton in the bottom right corner of the hangar. If Cogmind has used a [[Core Reset Matrix]] (CRM), it is possible to enter the Exoskeleton, which dramatically alters gameplay for the rest of the current run.

[[Heading]]Unique effects[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:3]]Additional Core Damage[[/Heading]]
Roughly 1/3 of all damage dealt to the Sigix Exoskeleton is also dealt to Cogmind's core.
[[Heading:3]]Alien Weapon Damage Boost[[/Heading]]
All non-AOE attacks from Sigix weapons is doubled. However, this effect does not stack with things like [[Particle Chargers]]. The full list of affected weapons is as follows: [[Core Cannon]], [[Core Stripper]], [[Modified Sigix Sheargun]], [[Sigix Broadsword]], [[Sigix Shearcannon]], and [[Sigix Sheargun]]
[[Heading:3]][[Assembled]] Absorption[[/Heading]]
While the Exoskeleton is damaged, Assembled can be absorbed to repair it by 30 integrity when standing next to Cogmind.
[[Heading:3]]Core Dependence[[/Heading]]
Cogmind's core becomes dependent on the Exoskeleton. Even if Cogmind still has remaining core, if the Exoskeleton is destroyed the game will instantly be loss.
[[Heading:3]]Enhanced Hypermatrix Pings[[/Heading]]
Whenever entering a new floor with Assembled spawns available (all main 0b10-controlled floors, [[DSF|DSFs]], and [[Command]]), 6-8 Assembled will appear near Cogmind. Additionally, the Exoskeleton provides the CRM's hypermatrix ping detection and Assembled summoning ability at all times rather than only while at 1/3 core.
[[Heading:3]]Damage Reduction[[/Heading]]
The Exoskeleton provides a 50% damage resistance to all conventional damage types. This effect stacks with most [[Defensive Utilities]], but not with [[Resistance Devices]].
[[Heading:3]]Deactivation-Proof[[/Heading]]
The Exoskeleton cannot be deactivated by any means. This includes manual deactivation as well as [[Heat]]-based side-effects.
[[Heading:3]]Infowar[[/Heading]]
The Exoskeleton provides extremely powerful sensor intel in an 18 tile radius. Perfect bot detection, terrain scanning, part detection, and hidden door detection is granted within this radius.
[[Heading:3]]High Coverage[[/Heading]]
While not exactly a unique ability, the Exoskeleton has a uniquely high 30,000 coverage which dwarfs every other item's coverage in the game. Most typical forms of armor are entirely unhelpful with the Exoskeleton equipped.
[[Heading:3]][[Maximum Security]] Triggering[[/Heading]]
As soon as Cogmind is spotted by any combat hostile in most [[0b10]]-controlled maps, Maximum Security will be immediately engaged. One notable exception is that Maximum Security will not be triggered in Command. Non-combat [[Watcher|Watchers]] and [[Operator|Operators]] whose associated [[Terminal]] hasn't be destroyed will also trigger this effect.
[[Image]]Exoskeleton4x.png|Cogmind's new look[[/Image]]
[[Heading:3]]New Appearance[[/Heading]]
Cogmind will take on the Sigix Warrior artwork, or the uppercase X character in ASCII mode.
[[Heading:3]]Slot Fixing[[/Heading]]
When Cogmind enters the Exoskeleton, all slots will be reset to a total of 1 Power, 3 Propulsion, 3 Utility, and 2 Weapon slots. However, Cogmind gets some boosts in exchange for the slots. Cogmind gains 100 fixed energy capacity, and every slot above the new 9 total slot count provides 3 innate energy generation and 5 heat dissipation. Not counting [[Core Expander|Core Expanders]], a typical -3 Section 7 provides 36 energy and 60 dissipation while a -2 Section 7 provides 42 energy and 70 dissipation. Slots can be evolved as normal after entering the Exoskeleton, including using Core Expanders. As a side-note, a [[Core Physics Calibrator]] cannot remove the 3 propulsion slots and force removal of the Exoskeleton.
[[Heading:3]]UI Intel[[/Heading]]
There are 4 new pieces of intel located at the bottom of the inventory UI:
[[List]]Threats: Counts the number of active hostiles within sensor radius.|Components: Counts the number of parts on the floor within sensor radius.|Ping number: Counts the number of active but untriggered Assembled hypermatrix pings.|Tor distance: Lists the distance to the Tor, the Sigix spaceship. The number in thousands place varies based on the map, but up to the hundreds place, it roughly indicates how many tiles Cogmind must travel to get to the nearest [[Surface]] exit.[[/List]]
[[Heading:3]]Unique Interactions[[/Heading]]
Cogmind becomes indistinguishable from a Sigix Warrior to some NPCs. [[Warlord]] will turn aggressive upon seeing Cogmind during the -2 [[Research]] attack or when summoned via Command cave seals. [[MAIN.C]] has unique encounter dialogue and a special phase 2 encounter after the outer shell is defeated, summoning 4 additional [[M Shell/Atk]] and 4 [[M Shell/Def]]s to his side. The [[Architect]] will recognize Cogmind, but also has unique encounter dialogue.","","","","","","",""

"Spacefold Activator","Part","Spacefold Activators are attachable non-consumable utility [[Alien Artifacts]] that allow moving through up to 3 solid objects, at a cost of Cogmind's core integrity equal to 1% of maximum for each space traveled. They can be found exclusively in the western side of [[Section 7]] as unguarded Artifacts.

Note that the core integrity cost is for every space traveled during a spacefold, and not for every solid object, meaning that the tile that Cogmind ends up on also counts. For example, a spacefold through 2 walls would cost 3% core integrity, 2% for the wall and 1% for the tile Cogmind ends up on.

[[Heading]]Uses[[/Heading]]
There are many Alien Artifacts or even regular items that can replace some of the Spacefold Activator's uses or at least allow for the same overall results, without the high core integrity cost. However, a Spacefold Activator is capable of a more versatile range of movements than any single one of those items, while also being precise, consistent and only taking up one slot.

[[List]]Spacefolds can be used to bypass Reinforced Barriers, Sealed Heavy Doors and other difficult-to-destroy obstacles, without causing any [[Alert]] gain or requiring hacking. Since none of those obstacles are ever larger than 3 tiles, the only cases where spacefolds fail is when those obstacles contain a solid object within, such as allied [[Derelict|Derelicts]] imprisoned within small cells in [[Garrison|Garrisons]]. As with some other travel methods, going past Sealed Heavy Doors and the like may cause 0b10 to eventually open them to allow combat robots to chase down Cogmind, especially if there is no other way through, which can make it possible for allies to go through as well.|

Spacefolds can be used to quickly get out of rooms or corridors when patrols or other dangers are approaching and into safer or more strategic locations, without creating any additional paths for those dangers to reach said locations. This is much faster than digging through walls, especially if there are multiple layers of solid objects in the way, and won't destroy any [[Interactive Machine|interactive machines]] that might have been in the way.|

Spacefolds can allow for longer-range safe [[Digging|digs]]. While a [[Microwarp Drive]] allows for an even longer safe digging range and a lower core integrity loss, Spacefold Activators only take up one slot and cannot cause Cogmind to go farther than expected. [[Comment]]I don't know how spacefolding affects cave-ins, but if the only thing that matters is dug-out tiles traversed and ""not-dug-out-but-diggable"" spaces don't matter, then it should be possible to do stuff like an eight-tile dig, by digging five tiles to create a ""waypoint"", then digging once to the side to create a spot where you can spacefold to the waypoint, making the full movement = Dug-out-tile -> 3-tile spacefold -> ""waypoint"" -> 3-tile spacefold -> destination.[[/Comment]]

"Stasis Trap","Part","Stasis Traps are [[Traps]] found in 0b10-controlled areas, and are especially common in [[Garrison|Garrisons]]. They are uniquely the only trap type to temporarily remain after being triggered, the only extractable trap type that cannot be stored inside [[Trap Extractors]], as well as the only trap type to be extractable [[I]]after[[/I]] being triggered (but before being depleted).

[[Heading]]Triggering[[/Heading]]
While the probability of triggering traps is based on current [[Propulsion]] type, the probability of triggering Stasis Trap is the opposite of regular Traps :
[[Table]]
Mode|Probability| Min. depletion on move
|| Overweight | 100% | N/A
|| [[Treads]] | 0% | 30
|| [[Legs]] | 25% | 15
|| [[Wheels]] | 50% | 10
|| [[Hover Units|Hover]] | 60% | 7
|| Core | 60% | 6
|| [[Flight Units|Flight]] | 80% | 5
[[/Table]]
Note that this means non-overweight threaded builds are ""immune"" to hostile Stasis Traps.

[[Heading]]Effects and depletion[[/Heading]]
Upon being triggered, Stasis Traps create a stasis field on the tile they occupy, which cancels the evasion bonus from [[Flight Units|Flight]]/[[Hover Units|Hover]]/[[Reaction Control Systems]] of robots inside and prevents them from moving away until the field is depleted, usually by the victim's repeated movement attempts. These traps pose no threat whatsoever on their own, but with bad timing can be can cause Cogmind to get stuck in exposed locations as nearby dangers approach the area. However, the stasis field also reduces all incoming damage by 25%.
The stasis field's strength starts at 100 minus whatever one movement of the victim would deplete, and can be escaped in one of five ways:
[[List]]
Attempting to move away from the stasis field will cause it to deplete by an amount equal to ([current mass support] - [current mass]) OR a minimum dependent on propulsion type (see table above), whichever is larger.
This means that detaching heavy parts can significantly speed up field depletion.
Note that attempting to move away always takes 1 turn, regardless of current movement speed, with the exception of the movement that finishes depleting the field.
Because of this, a spare Threads part can work as a makeshift [[Stasis Canceller]].
|Taking damage while in a stasis field will reduce that damage by 25% and deplete the stasis field by [damage absorbed].
|Using a Stasis Canceller and moving away from the trap will deplete it instantly.
|If the Stasis Trap is friendly, using a Trap Extractor will extract it and its stasis field, conserving whatever was left of the field strength.

If a Stasis Trap is activated by an EM explosion, a failure to hack using a [[Melee Datajacks|Melee Datajack]], is triggered and evaded using a [[Reaction Control Systems|Reaction Control System]] or if its victim is destroyed before the stasis field is depleted, the Trap will still generate its stasis field even without a victim inside. In this state, projectiles and explosions cannot interact with the stasis field itself (but can still destroy the Stasis Trap), and it is possible to move into the stasis field, which does not partially deplete it.

Below is an incomplete list of special interactions with Stasis Traps:

[[Comment]]When Stasis Traps are activated by EM explosions, they will always create a stasis field, even if there is no victim on the tile.

"Sterilization","Other","Sterilization is a special [[0b10]] response to Cogmind destroying too many combat bots on a single map. When activated, the ambient heat of the floor will be increased forever until Cogmind exits the map. As the heat increases, any remaining bots, parts on the ground, machines, and traps will all melt. Occasionally, machines will explode before they melt.
[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Sterilization System[[/Lore]]

[[Heading]]Triggering[[/Heading]]
The number of bots to kill to trigger Sterilization depends on the map.

Note: Unlike most other maps, in [[Access]] bots are not evacuated. The evacuation-related alerts will not appear and the bots will continue to stay on the map as usual.
[[Heading:2]]Rapid Sterilization[[/Heading]]
DSFs have a unique rapid sterilization system that works much quicker than normal sterilization. Ambient heat increases begin only 20 turns after the initial announcement and occur every 15 turns after that.

[[Heading]]Part Melting[[/Heading]]
After Sterilization is triggered, parts will begin to melt every 30-40 turns and be destroyed instantly. Parts that are 200 integrity or greater are safe from melting. Parts with a lower integrity are more likely to melt than those with higher integrity. For example, [[Treads]] and [[Armor]] tend to last longer or be immune to melting altogether, while fragile processors will melt almost instantly. Parts only melt when within a 20-tile radius around Cogmind, so with a good enough speed, timing, and luck, it is possible to grab parts that would otherwise melt quickly in the heat.","","","","","","",""
"Storage","Location","Storage is an early game [[0b10]]-controlled [[Branch]] with no unique rewards but plenty of good prototype parts. Storage maps tend to be fairly cramped just like [[Materials]] maps but with fewer patrols and many more [[Y-45 Defender|Sentries]] guarding individual rooms and corridors. There is an unusually high number of [[A-02 Transporter|Haulers]] in these maps. Destroying them for their loot is highly recommended on -9 and -8. On -7 however, many of the Haulers will begin summoning [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcements]] that can cause trouble. The majority of the [[Prototype Part|Prototype Parts]] at this point in the game will be weapons or flight units, so players trying to prepare for a flight transition should consider visiting Storage on -9 or -8. Combat players should also consider Storage as a good way to stock up on early game weaponry. -7 Storage is considered generally inferior to [[Caves]] because Caves has the advantage of [[Alert]] reduction as well as unique branch rewards.
Storage is notable for the large number of prototype parts available. Unique shell and vaults contain many useful early game loot. Vaults can also contain out-of-depth parts. Storage is also notable for the mostly guaranteed [[Garrison Access|Garrison]]. It is the only way to enter a Garrison on -9.

All of the special loot in Storage comes in the form of vaults and shells. The shells will only contain standard floor rating non-prototype and prototype parts. However, some of the vaults contain very out of depth prototype parts. The single item locked vault and the vault full of traps can contain rating 5* prototypes that are far out of depth compared to the normal Storage depths. These vaults can contain great items like [[Cld. Plasma Cannon]], [[Exp. Targeting Computer]], and even a semi-unique part [[Lgt. Regenerative Plating]]. Shells must be broke open by a weapon, while vaults must be hacked open via [[Terminal]]. Some vaults will already be open on entering the map.
[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There are 2 types of exits in Storage:

"Strategy/Attacking Scraptown","Other","[[Scraptown]] is an extremely challenging mid-game area to fight and full-clear. The majority of the armed bots are individually weak, but they appear in the dozens and can easily overwhelm Cogmind and any allies. Many unique items are only obtainable by destroying terrain or killing certain bots, which can make attacking Scraptown seem like a promising endeavor. However, there is a serious drawback of going for a full clear or even smashing a container for one item and running: The [[Zion]] and [[Warlord (Location)]] maps will become hostile when Cogmind tries to enter them. The [[Scraptown#civil_war|Civil War]] is a highly recommended alternative to gaining loot from this map. It is much easier and less risky than a full Scraptown murder is. As such, a Scraptown kill is a challenge that exists more for bragging rights than being a truly beneficial move.

[[Heading]]Items Obtainable by Murder[[/Heading]]

[[Voltaic Drivehammer]]: Science Guys shell prototype|
[[Vmp. Humpback]]: Curator's Association Exhibit[[/List]]

[[Heading]]Requirements[[/Heading]]
In order to effectively full clear Scraptown, there are a few general requirements:
[[Heading:2]][[Triborg]] Solve[[/Heading]]
Triborg is by far the scariest individual bot on the map with an incredibly powerful [[Siege Cannon]] that can quickly kill an unprepared Cogmind. Siege mode brings Triborg's initially high 40% core exposure down to a significantly reduced 28% which makes direct damage dealing a rather inefficient method. An EM resistance of 65% doesn't help an EM approach much either, with an average requirement of 285 EM damage to be dealt before corruption death. Very little conventional weaponry can deal enough damage to eliminate Triborg in a reasonable amount of time.
The most reliable way to beat Triborg is with meltdown. Large groups of allies with heat transfer can easily overheat Triborg before it gets much chance to deal damage. [[Storage]] frequently has a vault of 10 [[Grunt|Grunts]] that will become friendly to Cogmind upon entry. These 10 Grunts are sufficient to melt Triborg within a few volleys, if not instantly. [[Army Drone|Army Drones]] from [[Army-in-a-Box]] can also produce sufficient heat transfer for an easy kill. [[DAS Turret|DAS Turrets]] from [[Deploy-a-Sentry]] do not have heat transfer but have extremely high damage output, so if Cogmind can hold Triborg's fire, 3 or 4 turrets taken from the Exiles can deal enough conventional damage for core destruction.
Aside from allies, there are few other Exiles Prototypes that can handle the Triborg fight:
[[List]]
[[AWS/Autocannon]]: The Autocannon has an incredibly high damage output that can take Triborg out within 4 core hits.|
[[Field Lobotomy Kit]]: Triborg is not Disruption immune so the FLK will instantly turn a threat into a useful ally|
[[Firepult]]: Firepult has sufficient heat transfer to melt Triborg with ease. Make sure to pack plenty of cooling to use this early.|
[[YOLO Cannon]]: YOLO Cannon's high 50% meltdown critical easily kills Triborg. Note: the AOE effect of YOLO cannon may damage the loot on the ground.[[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]Trash Killer[[/Heading]]
Cogmind should have an efficient way of dealing with the dozens of average to weak-strength bots that will swarm Scraptown after hostilities begin. All bots will rush straight to the center of the map and Cogmind needs to either hide or take them out very efficiently. Simply average-depth loot will be unable to take out the huge rush of bots. The main strategies are to have an overwhelming force in the center of the map or to stand further away down a corridor and try to take bots out in smaller groups. If opting for the second strategy, long-ranged weaponry is the best to take advantage of some of the shorter-ranged bots.
Here are some good tools for the job:
[[List]]
Good [[Launchers]]: Since these bots tend to roam the map in groups, having powerful decently-ranged launchers like the [[Hvy. Rocket Launcher]] is the best way to take out groups from afar.|
AWS/Autocannon: Autocannon has enough damage to core any bot on this level, builtin targeting, fires beyond Cogmind's vision, and even has no upkeep cost.|
[[AWS/Gauss]]: Notably worse than the Autocannon with significantly lower damage, but still good for similar traits. With 3 weapon slots, can be combined with another non-AWS weapon for additional damage.|
Siege Cannon: Easily lootable off of Triborg with a [[CPS Tube]]. This requires the use of [[Tri-treads]] also dropped from Triborg to enter siege mode and avoid the recoil chance. Siege Cannon is not a great weapon to stay in the center of the map with, but retreating down the corridors where it is most effective can be difficult too.|
[[Hvy. Assault Cannon]]: High range and sufficient damage to one shot any bot on core.|
DAS Turrets have high visual range (22) and will kill every bot in one core hit. Keep in mind that eventually they will run low on matter and take longer to fire.|
Bot Army: While they don't last forever, a well positioned army can act as a firing squad for bots that wander into their line of sight. Ideally this includes some combination of Storage Grunts, miscellaneous [[Recycling]] rewirable bots, and potentially even fabricated [[0b10]] bots like [[P-60 Hacker|P-60 Hackers]].|
Army-in-a-Box: Similar to a Grunt army, only there's a lot more Army Drones available. Don't use too many at once or else they will get in each others' way. For maximum effectiveness, return bots that have taken core hits and bots that have short-ranged weapons.
[[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]Essential Parts[[/Heading]]
No NPC murder setup is complete without a few highly essential build components:
[[List]]Backup Treads: Cogmind can easily salvage Triborg for Tri-treads and those should be used if possible. However, depending on Cogmind's starting position, it may be possible to be stuck fighting without having time to move over to the Triborg loot and swapping to the treads. If Cogmind happens to miss a CPS tube hit, a lot of essential loot may not drop.|
Backup Wheels (Optional): [[Wheels]] are useful to temporarily swap on to move quickly. Useful for picking up matter out of Tractor Beam range.|
Backup Armor: Self-explanatory. Triborg drops [[Mak. Medium Armor Plating]] and Elites drop [[Mak. Light Armor Plating]] to use in a pinch.|
Backup Weapons: Aside from Siege Cannon, most of the weapons dropped by NPCs on this map are not ideal for Cogmind to use in Scraptown.|
Backup Power: Self-explanatory.|
[[Cooling Devices]] (optional): Siege Cannon in particular is hot to use in prolonged combat.|
[[Ranged Targeting Utilities]]/[[Weapon Cyclers]]/[[Core Analyzers]] (optional): Useful offensive utilities|
[[Hardlight Generators]]/[[Shield Generators]]/[[Force Fields]] (optional): Useful defensive utilities|
[[Tractor Beam|Normal]] or [[Hpw. Tractor Beam]] and [[Matter Compressors]] (optional): Siege cannon requires a lot of matter to use. Matter storage and Tractor Beams allow Cogmind to continue to fight in extended encounters without having to reposition to collect more matter.|
[[Adv. Visual Processing Unit]]/[[Seismic Detector]] (optional): With long ranged weapons like Siege Cannon, it is best to hit enemies before they can see you and outside of their visual range.
[[/List]]

[[Heading]]When to Kill[[/Heading]]
Generally, a build should be designed for killing Scraptown several maps ahead of time. This will typically involve going to [[Exiles (Location)]] and either taking [[FarCom]] or killing/stealing for powerful Exiles prototypes that can handle Scraptown kills. Scraptown kills are best done on -7 for the maximum amount of slots and preparation time. While it may still be possible to kill earlier, killing at -7 is difficult enough already. Cogmind should have at least 3 propulsion slots and 3 weapon slots to use Tri-treads and Siege Cannon from Triborg.

[[Heading]]Location to Fight[[/Heading]]
When engaging hostilities, there are 2 best points where Cogmind can choose to start the fight:
[[Heading:2]]Next to the UFD Gate[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Scraptown Triborg Surrounded.png|Grunts surrounding Triborg prepared to melt it down, with nearby Protector[[/Image]]
The gate is the best place to begin if Cogmind has allies or a quick way to neutralize Triborg. There is lots of room so allies won't have to run past each other or try to shoot through each other like they would in hallways. However, the open area is also a downside for the hostile UFD bots that can pour in from many different directions. Allies should initially be positioned around Triborg in a box as shown to the right. If a [[Protector]] is available, place it close to the corner of the Gate so it is more out of harms way. Note: Even with a large number of allies, expect to have to retreat to the corner of the map at some point during the fight.
[[Heading:2]]Bottom Left Corner[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Scraptown Bottom Left Triborg Path.png|Path Triborg should take if in the bottom left corner[[/Image]]
If the Triborg solution doesn't involve allies, it is much better to hide in the corner of the map to avoid the initial bot swarm. Stay in the position shown in the image to the right to begin hostilities. When Triborg peeks around the corner, move up a few tiles so Triborg is forced to move closer to Cogmind to shoot. The right side path to this location is a little short, but the top path can take good advantage of the large sightlines.

[[Heading]]Beginning Hostilities[[/Heading]]
If Cogmind starts the Scraptown assault near Triborg, the #1 priority is to use a CPS tube on Triborg to ensure full salvage drops. Take out Triborg with whatever means are available, then grab and equip the Tri-treads and Siege Cannon (if slots available). The center is a tough position to stay long-term, so use allies as temporary distractions and retreat to a safer area of the map like the bottom left corner. If fighting in the corner, start by either shooting a wall out or killing any nearby bot. Lure Triborg close and use the CPS Tube, then go for the kill or assimilate. After Triborg is dead, stay put and slowly clear out the UFD squads that wander by. Eventually, Optimus and friends will come directly to Cogmind. After taking them out, the hardest challenges of the map are done.
At this point, patience is key. Wait around for any leftover UFD patrols to wander by and take them out. Leaving too soon can force a fight against a lot of bots in a bad position. Generally, only moving around to collect more matter when needed is the best strategy here. A [[Seismic Detector]] can tell when patrols are coming by from far away.
After waiting around for a few thousand turns without any action, it is time to take the center of the map. This is where the vast majority of the remaining bots are. Sniping bots from afar one at a time works best here as heading directly into the center area can alert larger groups of bots to all attack simultaneously. There are likely still a few dozen bots hanging around the area. After the center is all cleared, be careful of any patrols leftover on the right side of the map.

[[Heading]]Loot Time[[/Heading]]
Most of the loot should be fairly self explanatory to grab. A few less obvious ones:
[[List]]
Dig through the back of the Scrapoid Pod storage to get many more pods|
Dig out the center earth tile in LU-1G1's Boring Crew room|
Check rooms closed for remodelling for the rare Exp. Plasma Cutter|
Smash open the wall hiding additional Botcubes in the Botcube Research room
[[/List]]","Spoiler","","","","","",""
"Strategy/Cetus","Other","When first entering [[Cetus]], the 4 [[Cetus Guard|Cetus Guards]] appearing around the corner may appear intimidating at first. However, they are not too tough of foes and have some extremely useful loot, especially the [[Adv. KE Penetrator]], [[Centrium Heavy Treads]], and [[Centrium Medium Armor Plating]]. They have an above average amount of core integrity but no critical destroy immunity or EM resistance, so destroy critical weapons like [[Hyp. Weapons]] and [[Electromagnetic Weapons]] work quite well against them. [[Electromagnetic Launchers]] like the [[Proton Missile Launcher|regular]] and [[Imp. Proton Missile Launcher]] are particularly effective at taking out 4 of them in a short amount of time. There will be some [[Corrupted Parts|corrupted]] parts, but this loot is definitely worth the corruption. 
Often, Cogmind will have a big group of allies brought over from [[Extension]]. These can be helpful and harmful at the same time. Too many allies, especially melee ones, will get in the way of each other. Telling some blue-controllable allies to stay back can be a good idea. [[A7]] in particular is a great ally, providing EM damage and [[Remote Force Field|remote force fielding]] effects. Another standout ally is the [[Guerrilla (5)|Guerilla]]. They have -Salvage from their [[Bore Cannon]], but perform very well against the Cetus Guards due to their very high critical destroy chance, often destroying weapons or even cores in a single hit. However, to get optimal salvage, they should be left behind.

[[Heading]]Cetus Mainframe[[/Heading]]
The [[Reinforced Walls#cetus|Cetus Mainframe Doors]] have a very low base success rate of 10% and a high armor value of 40. While [[Hackware]] can help out here, the Cetus Guards can conveniently drop a [[Adv. Variable Charge Gun]] which can be overloaded to destroy the Sealed Heavy Doors. A [[Plasma Cutters|Plasma Cutter]] will eventually cut through as well.

[[Heading]]Murdering A7[[/Heading]]
If not planning to tackle the extended game, you may decide to murder A7 in Cetus after doing any other desired activities, like activating the Cetus Manufacturing Module and defeating the Cetus Guards. A7 can drop valuable loot including [[Med. Regenerative Plating]], which is otherwise difficult to obtain at this point in the game. You also get the [[A7 Data Core]], which makes it much more viable to visit [[Lab]]: [[Redacted]]the data core grants entry and reveals the intruder-detecting lasers[[/Redacted]]. A7 does not fight back, even if attacked.

The tradeoff is, of course, that a dead A7 will not provide a code after exiting the map. A7 vanishes soon after leaving the map, so it's easiest to kill A7 while still in Cetus.","Spoiler","","","","","",""
"Strategy/Defeating Architect","Other","[[Image]]Access_0 Entrance.png|Hostile Entrance to Access_0[[/Image]]
[[Access_0]] is one of the hardest maps in the game that requires Cogmind to deal with numerous powerful threats on the map that gives very little breathing room for fixing a build that is starting to fall apart. Assuming [[MAIN.C]] is defeated in [[Command]], there is a large amount of preparation that can be done after all of the bots have become disabled. [[Command#command_cache_contents|MAIN.C's cache]] can provide some incredibly powerful parts, and the rest of the map can have plenty of goodies to grab. Since Access_0 is a very combat-oriented map, make sure to bring backups of essentials like power, propulsion, weapons, and armor. While there are some part caches in Access_0 itself, their contents are not particularly reliable and shouldn't be counted on to provide crucial backups. A more consistent source of parts are the drops from the [[Enhanced Bot|Enhanced Bots]] and the [[A Bots]], assuming weapons with neutral salvage can be used at least some of the time. There tend to be abundant legs and mediocre-quality power above all else from the [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]] and [[Enhanced Hunter|Enhanced Hunters]]. The Grunt's [[Neutron Cannon|Neutron Cannons]] can serve in a pinch, but aren't impressive due to their middling damage and short range.

[[Heading]]Propulsion Selection[[/Heading]]
All propulsion types can be used to win in Access_0, although some are definitely better suited to the map than others. Hover and legs are nice middle ground propulsion that can have a lot of power and still retain maneuverability. Treads are the best heavy combat type with lots of coverage and integrity, but they may get stuck fighting in bad situations with no good way to reposition. Wheels are much more more niche than treads due to the rarity of good lategame wheels. Flight is the easiest to use to take down all of the pads but can struggle the most to finish off the Architect in the final fight due to lack of integrity.
[[Heading:2]][[Flight Units|Flight]][[/Heading]]
Flight builds should be extremely quick at this point in the game (sub 20 speed) and are able to outrun every bot on the map. Flight does not have the integrity for prolonged fighting. Typically flight builds should destroy the pads first and then try to lure the Architect away from all of the other bots for a quick kill. Evasion utilities in [[Phase Shifters]] and [[Reaction Control Systems]] work well to minimize the number of attacks that land. More expensive defensive utilities like [[Shield Generators]] or [[Force Fields]] also combine well with evasion utilities but may be tough to support. A bots are a major threat to this playstyle, as their remote force fields can prolong the final encounter to the point that Cogmind is unable to finish off the Architect. Destroy critical weapons like the [[Hyp. Multirail]] can be good for taking out a few enhanced bots or removing hover units off of key A bots so they don't catch up as quickly for the final fight. A strong final Architect-killer weapon is a must for this strategy.
[[Heading:2]][[Hover Units|Hover]][[/Heading]]
Hover builds tend to be the hardest to put together but can end up with a strong mix of speed, offensive, and defensive capabilities. Using a [[Zio. Metafield Generator]] or [[ST Field Compressor]] can help to outrun groups of bots or reposition more easily. However, a strategy entirely based on running away tends to fare much worse for hover builds due to the lower speed and ability to get trapped with the inability to hop in tight 1 tile corridors. Hover builds should choose their fights carefully and can reposition in combat to avoid getting outnumbered. Unlike Flight builds, Hover builds usually have the energy and mass support to use both evasion utilities and other defensive utilities like Force Fields. This combination can cut down significantly on attrition while exploring the map.
[[Heading:2]][[Legs]][[/Heading]]
Leg builds finally start to trend into the area where having a reliable way to ""shoo"" (deal 80 core damage to trigger the teleport) the Architect is a requirement. Legs can take advantage of the movement bonuses to dodge (5/10/15 extra evasion per tile moved in a row) and use evasion utilities to avoid most shots while running in a straight line. However, extensive repositioning is quite expensive, even for faster leg builds. [[Infowar]] like [[Terrain Scanners]] or [[Drone Bays]] can help locate the pads quicker and reduce damage taken from the Architect coming back repeatedly. One option for legs is a ""siege legs"" build, where an extra pair of treads are used in addition to the standard legs. This requires 2 extra propulsion slots above what Cogmind already needs to support for the full effect. However, it is not worth attaching treads if it will place Cogmind overweight. One of the bigger benefits of this strategy is that the Enhanced Hunters can't continually knock Cogmind back into collapsed tiles due to the knockback cancellation ability of treads. Additionally, siege mode can be used for tough encounters.
[[Heading:2]][[Wheels]]/[[Treads]][[/Heading]]
Wheels and treads are the slowest Access_0 propulsion types, and as such, need to be the most prepared for heavy combat. Lots of armor and strong weaponry are required for these builds. Wheel builds tend to have lower propulsion slots and higher utility slots, necessitating more utility slots being taken up by armor to compensate. Treads usually have 6-8 propulsion slots and can afford to run less armor in utility slots due to the higher propulsion coverage. Terrain scanning and drones are especially recommended for these builds to reduce the pad finding time. They will end up needing to shoo the Architect repeatedly throughout the level and fight every bot they meet.
[[Heading:2]][[Sigix Exoskeleton]][[/Heading]]
The Exoskeleton plays a little differently from the other propulsion types. Due to its incredible amount of builtin infowar, it is quite easy to find and destroy all of the Architect's pads. With the [[Sigix Shearcannon]] it is quite easy to destroy every bot on the map in a few volleys. An Exoskeleton-boosted [[Core Cannon]] can kill the Architect from full integrity, which allows skipping the pad destroying altogether. With weaker weapons like [[Sigix Sheargun|Sigix Shearguns]] or a [[Sigix Broadsword]], the Exoskeleton tends to play like a hover build without much shooing power, taking a few specific encounters and killing A bots, but mostly running from the Architect in favor of searching and destroying the pads.

[[Heading]]Key Weapon Roles[[/Heading]]
Some weapon types excel at some situations and not in others. Entropic, Kinetic, Pierce, Slashing, Thermal, Vortex damage-dealing weapons all tend to be good all-around in Access_0. Electromagnetic damage is decent in a few key places, while Impact and Explosive damage tend to be subpar. However, there are some particularly useful weapons for specific circumstances. Ratings below include (-) = not suitable for role, (~) = passable for role, (+) = good for role, (++) = great for role. Ratings are a combination of how good the weapon is at killing something, its + or - salvage potential, and resource costs of use.

[[/Table]]
[[List:Ordered]]The Core Cannon is very strong vs most bots in Access_0 but costs too much core to use consistently, it will often result in early death by core.|Critical hits can disarm or destroy propulsion/weapons of some coring immune bots but not kill directly. Mostly niche use for flight/hover.|A6 is neutral to EM and annoying to kill otherwise, but all other A bots are 75% resistant.|Vortex Lances are the strongest melee weapon here but they have limited uses and should be used sparingly. A bots and the Architect final fight are the best uses for the Vortex Lance as a primary weapon.|Multirails are reasonable Architect shooers, but they have a very high matter upkeep. A [[Desublimator]] or other matter regenerating utilities are recommended to allow Multirails to shoo over a long period of time.|The Cep. Plasma Driver is a slightly worse Architect shoo due to its 1/3 chance of dealing less than the 80 damage required.|The Sigix Shearcannon has incredible firepower but it comes with a caveat. Cogmind must typically be within 2-4 tiles of the target in order to gain maximum damage potential. Otherwise the weapon's arc will cause some projectiles to miss, with higher percentages of projectiles missing at further distances. This weapon is best suited for faster propulsion types, although even treads can make good use if it in some situations.|Vortex weaponry is quite powerful and good at killing all in Access_0. However, it is not good to use for fighting everything as they have limited usages. A bots and the final Architect kill tend to be the most important uses.|These launchers have very strong killing power and Architect shooing potential. However, the incredibly high matter cost makes them not a good choice for regular usage. One or two [[Prc. Matter Filter|Prc. Matter Filters]] along with a Desublimator may make this a more reliable option, but it may be a bad idea to rely too heavily on launchers without other good options due to the risk of running out of matter entirely.|The Alpha Cannon Mk. II does not need any particle charging in some situations but does in others. It naturally kills 120 integrity Enhanced Grunts/Hunters in 2 hits with its base 65 damage. A bots and Enhanced Sentries have 150 core integrity which takes 3 hits. However, an Adv. Particle Charger ups the damage to 81. This turns those 3 hits into a 2 hit kill. This also matters for the Architect, where 81 damage will guarantee the shoo on a single core hit instead of requiring 2 hits.[[/List]]

[[Heading]]Other useful parts[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:2]]Targeting[[/Heading]]
Specifically, [[Ranged Targeting Utilities]], for ranged combat, or [[Melee Analysis Suites]] for melee. Targeting is the most important combat utility to use in Access_0. The Architect and Enhanced Hunters all run [[Exp. Phase Shifter|Exp. Phase Shifters]] which dramatically reduce chance to hit ranged attacks. Running 2-3 targeting utilities is extremely recommended to maintain a high chance to hit, although melee builds are able to get away with fewer.
[[Heading:2]]Core chance to hit boosters[[/Heading]]
Specifically, [[Core Analyzers]] and [[Armor Integrity Analyzers]]. Next to targeting, these are the best offensive utilities to use. Core Analyzers are superior, but they both work together. An Armor Integrity Analyzer should be used over the second Core Analyzer if there is space.
[[Heading:2]][[Weapon Cyclers]]/[[Actuators]][[/Heading]]
Weapon cycling is another great way to increase the damage done. Keep in mind they do require extra weapon energy/heat upkeep as the full volley will be fired more quickly than without. A [[Mni. Quantum Capacitor|Mni.]] or [[Quantum Capacitor|Regular Quantum Capacitor]] is good for any single powerful energy cannon, especially ones that can shoo the Architect in a single core hit.
[[Heading:2]][[Kinecellerators]]/[[Particle Chargers]][[/Heading]]
Nearly mandatory for some weapon types and less important for others. In some cases, like with the Omega Cannon and an Adv. Kinecellerator, it can be the difference between a single core hit Architect shoo and a double core hit Architect shoo.
[[Heading:2]][[Shield Generators]] and [[Force Fields]][[/Heading]]
Force fields are one of the best ways to reduce damage in the game as long as their heavy energy demands can be met. Airborne propulsion may want to use Shield Generators for their lesser energy requirements and lighter mass.
[[Heading:2]][[Phase Shifters]]/[[Reaction Control Systems]][[/Heading]]
All around good ways to reduce damage taken. Reaction Control Systems can only effectively be used by airborne propulsion types and legs.
[[Heading:2]][[Microwarp Drive]][[/Heading]]
This is especially useful for grounded propulsion types. The Microwarp Drive can be used to travel large distances very quickly in order to get to a specific pad location, reposition for a fight, or even just move around much quicker than normal. The core cost is prohibitive for constant warping, but this item can save a lot on overall build attrition with good use.
[[Heading:2]]Scouting Infowar[[/Heading]]
Specifically, [[Terrain Scanners]] with [[Terrain Scan Processors]], [[Drone Bays]], [[Visual Processing Units]], [[Structural Scanner]] or [[Deep Structural Scanner|DSS]] variant, [[Triangulator]], or [[IFF Parsers]]. All of these provide extra bot or map intel which can be used for locating pads more easily, finding shortcut digs that can be taken, or avoiding some bots. The Structural Scanner is more useful for airborne propulsion than grounded propulsion since it works instantly and can be used to dodge groups of hostiles if running away. It doesn't typically help find the pads sooner like the others.
[[Heading:2]][[ECM Suites]][[/Heading]]
For airborne propulsion only. This can help take some pressure off by causing groups of followers to much more quickly lose tracking of Cogmind.
[[Heading:2]][[Triangulator]][[/Heading]]
This typically niche item has a unique ability in that it allows for tracking hostiles at 24 range even if they can't be seen via other sensor methods. The Architect has scan cloak 5 which prevents all other detection methods. Using the Triangulator can pinpoint the way the Architect is coming from at long range which can greatly help in determining pad locations.
[[Heading:2]]Matter generating utilities[[/Heading]]
Specifically, [[Desublimator]], [[Field Recycling Units]], [[Matter Filters]], [[Tractor Beams]], and [[Matter Compressors]]. For any kinetic based weapons or weapons that cause a lot of negative salvage like the Potential Cannons, having ways of stockpiling matter or restocking up on matter mid-map can be entirely essential to avoid losing the run due to running out of matter. The Desublimator can be found off of Enhanced Hunters only on this map, but the others can be brought over from earlier maps.
[[Heading:2]]Energy support[[/Heading]]
Specifically, [[Energy Wells]], [[Power Amplifiers]], and [[Energy Filters]]. All of these utilities can be used to maintain expensive energy cannons and force fields through prolonged combat. Energy wells can be dropped on the ground to instantly absorb the energy needed to keep firing, while the others must be attached to help.
[[Heading:2]][[Remote Datajacks]][[/Heading]]
If the Data Conduit is used, Cogmind will be given intel for instant kill codes for all A bots that must be used with a Remote Datajack.
[[Heading:2]][[Terrabomb]][[/Heading]]
Although a little niche, Terrabombs do great at opening up a large part of the map to check for nearby pads. This is a double-edged sword since any nearby groups of enemies will spot you instantly, and the Architect can potentially start shooting from out of weapon range.
[[Heading:2]][[Sigix Terminator|Regular]] or [[Supercharged Sigix Terminator]][[/Heading]]
This single-use weapon is best used after taking down all of the pads in order to kill or at least severely cripple the Architect for the final fight. If airborne, this can also be used to kill off a lot of the bots following behind in a big mass.
[[Heading:2]][[Transdimensional Reconstructor|Regular]] or [[Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor]][[/Heading]]
There is almost always one of these on the map somewhere, and the Architect drops one when defeated. However, using one of these to escape can be an issue if defeating the Architect with a weapon with knockback like a kinetic cannon because it may be dropped too far away to pick up to exit the map in time. Potential Cannons also have a habit of destroying them when dropped on the ground. Keeping a spare is a way to escape with a non-Architect killing win if all hope is lost instead of dying in Access_0.
[[Heading:2]][[Core Reset Matrix]][[/Heading]]
There are several Alien Artifacts on the map and using the Core Reset Matrix ahead of time allows for locating them right away on entering the map. Sometimes being able to head for a Core Regenerator or Integrity Redistributor right away after entering the map is the difference between a loss and a win.
[[Heading:2]][[Integrity Redistributor]][[/Heading]]
Useful to prevent essential parts of the build from breaking or just generally to repair everything at once. Limited parts with very high value such as [[Shieldings]] or non-regenerative armor like [[Zio. Shade Armor]] or [[Exp. Powered Armor]], as well as unique parts that are essential to the build, should be taken off preemptively at low integrity in order to use a Redistributor on them at a later time.
[[Heading:2]][[Core Regenerator]][[/Heading]]
Most helpful if using core-hungry Alien Artifacts like the Core Cannon, Microwarp Drive, or an Integrity Redistributor. It provides 400 (or more core with [[LRC Armor]] that can be used as more fuel for these parts, or even just extra integrity to stay alive. Sometimes it is better to use before entering the map if core is low enough.
[[Heading:2]][[Navigation Efficiency Matrix]][[/Heading]]
While this artifact can be very painful to use from the random teleportation, it does have some good usages in Access_0. When teleporting, all of the Enhanced bots lose tracking on Cogmind. This can be used on airborne propulsion to avoid getting large groups of Enhanced bots following behind, or on grounded propulsion to attempt to reposition or even avoid fighting groups of enemies. It is a mixed bag since it can just as easily teleport Cogmind into an even worse position than before.

[[Heading]]Stages of the map[[/Heading]]
There are several distinct stages of the map where different strategies can be used. Some playstyles may skip certain stages entirely, like how a flight build will typically not stick around for the initial map fight, while grounded propulsion builds will have to fight.
[[Heading:2]]Initial fight[[/Heading]]
Cogmind is confronted by the Architect, A8, and 2 dormant Enhanced Grunts. Rarely, a patrol of more Enhanced Grunts or Enhanced Hunters spawns close enough to also join in here. Flight will typically ignore this part and skip straight to hunting for the pads to destroy. Hover can kill all the bots and shoo the Architect right away or move deeper into the level and try to fight the bots one-on-one instead. Grounded propulsion usually need to fight right at the starting position, so be prepared with strong weaponry to begin with. Siege up right at the entrance of the map if using treads. Targeting the Architect for a shoo is usually the best approach, followed by A8, and finally the Enhanced Grunts. If lacking any good Architect shooing weapons, focusing A8 first may be preferable so A8's Remote Force Field won't be able to protect the Architect.
[[Heading:2]]Searching for the pads[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Access_0 Subspace Access Node.png|Subspace Access Node layout[[/Image]]
This stage is where the vast majority of the time spent in Access_0. This part involves running or actively fighting the Architect, Enhanced bot guards and patrols, and the A bots as they appear. Infowar utilities are most useful at this time. The general strategy for combat here is to shoo the Architect and then start heading in the direction that it came from. Since it typically comes from the closest pad, that is the best way to get in the right general area. However, if multiple pads are close by, the Architect can start spawning at different pads and coming at different directions. This can make it tough to decide which direction to head in. Infowar is best to help find the pads in this situation, but if none is available then making a guess at the pad location and heading there is better than getting stuck moving back and forth in a loop, failing to get anywhere.
When using terrain scanning, there are often telltale signs of a pad even before getting the whole area scanned. Any of the 4 inner tiles or the 4 surrounding cyan tiles are very recognizable. The white tiles surrounding the machine are also not guaranteed to lead to a pad, but they are good to investigate. Finally, pads are always found at the end of 2 tile corridors. Following 2 tile paths can be a good way to get to the final pad location.
Drone Bays and especially Terrain Scanners tend to have high coverage and not the most impressive integrity. They should usually be swapped out during any prolonged combat encounters for offensive utilities or better armor. With a good shooing weapon, it may not be necessary to swap out every time the Architect comes. Make sure these important utilities don't get destroyed early on. If using drones, the best time to release them is just before or right after the Architect teleports away. That gives them the maximum amount of time to explore before the Architect gets a chance to attack them.
If the [[Data Conduit]] was used, finding the pads is easy since all the machines are revealed on entering the map. However, the additional [[Enhanced Programmer]] patrols can be a huge pain even when knowing exactly where to go. Make sure to have a good answer to these Programmers.
Most of the A bots are fairly similar in overall strategy to fight. Most have remote force fields that shield allies, so the A bots are a high priority to take out first. EM is ineffective against all of them except for A6, for which EM is the best solution. Generally, any other damage type is fine for taking out the rest of them. Core Stripper and Disintegrator are uniquely good for killing some of the A bots because they guarantee (or nearly guarantee) full salvage of all parts.
[[Heading:2]]Destroying the Singularity Gate (optional)[[/Heading]]
Destroying the gate is an optional action that needs to be done in order to obtain any Architect Logs lore without a way to dig into the 120 armored shell. Otherwise, the singularity will crush Cogmind before there is enough time to get the lore. The gate is on the left side of the map and [[A2]] is on the way. The gate itself is very fragile and just about any weapon will destroy it easily. It is best to get rid of nearby pads on the right side of the map before crossing the bridge so the Architect takes longer to get to Cogmind's location. After that, take the trek back to finish off the final pad and the Architect.
[[Heading:2]]The final pad[[/Heading]]
After all the other pads are destroyed, the Architect will continually teleport back to the last pad. This can be frustrating for grounded propulsion, where after being shooed the Architect will return after only a few moves as you get closer and closer. At a certain point, it is best to ignore the Architect and just walk by until the last pad is destroyed. Faster propulsion types have an easier time of doing this, and the Microwarp Drive can help a lot here. Putting on evasion utilities helps to reduce the damage taken during this last walk.
[[Heading:2]]The final fight[[/Heading]]
After all this, the Architect can finally be fought normally. For grounded builds, siege up with any treads if you have them, then start fighting to the death. Frailer airborne builds might need to lure the bulk of the pursuers to one corner of the map and then take the Architect to the other side of the map to avoid getting overwhelmed.
[[Heading:2]]Escape/cleaning up[[/Heading]]
After the Architect is destroyed, the Singularity Gate will be trigger a 10 turn countdown if still intact. Grounded builds may need to be close to the Architect if relying on the Transdimensional Reconstructor that it drops. The singularity countdown will kill Cogmind instantly if still on the map in that time. Slower builds will usually need to detach all parts and core hover to equip the Reconstructor and to make it to the exit. Airborne propulsion usually have enough time to get to the exit without needing to do this.
If the gate is destroyed, however, there is an unlimited amount of time to clean up any stragglers on the map. Get the [[Architect Data Core]] and head to the bottom-left corner of the map to open up the Architect Logs Terminal and obtain any new lore. Exploring the rest of the map will cause all remaining A bots to spawn as normal. The A bots and any other remaining Enhanced bots can be fought for extra points.","Redacted","","","","","",""
"Strategy/Defeating MAIN.C","Other","[[Command]] is one of the toughest maps in the game and has a lot to prepare for. Since the most challenging encounters on the map are fixed, it is possible to prepare for many things ahead of time. Unlike the basic [[Wintypes]], combat is mandatory in order to kill [[MAIN.C]], although Cogmind does not necessarily need to do any fighting. However, it is always a good idea to be able to meaningfully contribute to the fight. [[Command#cave_seal_contents|Cave Seal allies]] can be incredibly strong, and can even kill MAIN.C unaided in some cases.

[[Heading]]Seal Strategy[[/Heading]]
Both [[Warlord (Alignment)]] and [[Imprint]] seals are quite powerful and have the potential to carry a run through the [[Command#doom_corridor|Doom Corridor]], and sometimes even through MAIN.C. Since seals have a 0% base success rate, opening them requires some forward planning. A decent stack of [[Hackware]] is all but required to open seals successfully. Killing 0b10 [[Operator|Operators]] can be a good way to stockpile Hackware ahead of time. Destroying one or more Network Hubs in [[Hub_04(d)]] can provide free defensive hacking bonuses. Prototype Hackware is very useful here for minimizing the number of utilities that need to be carried around. Other ways to increase hacking capabilities are the [[Terminal]] Trojan(Botnet) hack and the allied Operator bonus.
One advantage of Warlord alignment is the ability to skip the Hackware requirement entirely. After staying approximately 1000 turns in the [[Warlord (Alignment)#-2_research_assault|-2 Research Assault]], a special manual hack will be given to Cogmind that will open both Command seals.
Locating the Seals can be difficult on some maps. Unless the Phase Generator is destroyed, terrain scanning does not work in Command. It may be worth keeping a [[Terrain Scanners|Terrain Scanner]] around in case of an early Phase Generator. While it does generate 150+ Alert, the ability to search for Seals and potentially use [[Sensor Arrays|Sensors]] to avoid enemy encounters may be a worthy tradeoff. Unfortunately, the [[Machine Analyzer]] does not work on seal Terminals, and neither does the [[GameText]]Index(Terminals)[[/GameText]] hack. Using the [[Data Conduit]] trivializes the search, as all machine intel is given instantly upon entering the map.
Once a seal has been located, there is one choice to make. Use the seal now or fight the Doom Corridor first and come back for the seal for the MAIN.C fight? The answer can depend on the seal type, Alert situation, machine location relative to the Doom Corridor, Cogmind's build, and more. Opening a seal will spawn a large group of allies immediately and allows a few backup waves to spawn over time. This is great to protect Cogmind immediately, although it may not help the Alert situation in the case of Imprint or Core Reset Matrix (CRM) seals if there are a lot of hostiles nearby or if the seal is far away from the Doom Corridor. Large groups of blue or purple allies can skyrocket Alert and trigger [[High Security]] quickly. Warlord allies do not generate Alert themselves, so this is less of an issue for that faction. If the seal is far from the Doom Corridor, it may be impractical for Cogmind to defeat the Doom Corridor solo and then make the trek back to the seal and then all the way back to MAIN.C without getting caught up by additional patrols, [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]], and [[Assault Squad|Assaults]]. Prolonged time in Command will cause part attrition to Cogmind and/or a loss of seal allies very quickly. High Security disables the seal machines and the Assault forces will make quick work of any amassed allies with additional [[Demolisher|Demolishers]] being sent along, although already opened seals will not stop spawning allies when the machine network is disabled. If Cogmind is already in good shape to take on the Doom Corridor without assistance, the allies may be better saved for the MAIN.C fight instead.

[[Heading]]Doom Corridor Strategy[[/Heading]]
The Doom Corridor is the first major fight of the extended endgame. 2 [[M Guard|M Guards]] and 2 [[Combat Programmer|Combat Programmers]] down a hallway. They can tank very well and deal quite a bit of damage back to Cogmind. It is possible to skip fighting Doom Corridor to avoid any combat at this part, but it is not generally recommended because all 4 of the guards will be summoned to aid MAIN.C later on. The vast majority of runs hoping to complete Command will have to fight head-on.
[[Heading:2]]Doom Corridor Skip[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Command Doco Skip.png|One Doom Corridor skip[[/Image]]
Digging past the Doom Corridor requires a strong digging tool that can break through 100 armor tiles, ideally at range. Dig the path shown on the right to safely get past without being spotted. The end of this path results in a 4 tile dig which does have a slight cave-in risk. There is an alternative route that digs directly into the terminal tile and through the Sealed Barrier instead, but this can be even riskier as a poorly timed misfire or misdirect can place Cogmind in a very bad spot. Another alternative skipping solution for airborne builds is to use one or mores [[ECM Suites]] after luring the guards out of the corridor. The idea is to loop the Combat Programmers across the map for a while until the M Guards get sufficiently far out of the way. Then use the ECM Suites on the return trip so they forget about Cogmind. Then simply pass through the corridor up to MAIN.C, forgotten by its guards.
[[Heading:3]]Why skip?[[/Heading]]
There are a few reasons why skipping the guards might be desirable. If going for a [[Command#w8_fortifying_0b10surrender|W8 Wintype]], keeping the Doom Corridor guards alive is very useful for defeating the summoned [[Enhanced Q-Series]]. The more bots destroyed on the way, the fewer guards there are to protect Cogmind and MAIN.C for the hard part of the ending. Another reason could be if [[Zhirov]]'s SGEMP quest has been completed. Zhirov will set off the Modified SGEMP after phase one of MAIN.C is defeated any unpower all bots anyway, so there is not a big benefit in fighting the Doom Corridor first, except for the possibility of looting the valuable M Guard loot. One last reason might be if Cogmind has a very powerful MAIN.C killer, where the guards won't be able to reach Cogmind by the time MAIN.C is dead. This is mostly applicable to the extreme superweapon the [[BFG-9k Vortex Edition]] that can kill MAIN.C in only a few hits.
[[Heading:2]]Doom Corridor Guards[[/Heading]]
The Doom Corridor guards are quite intimidating at first glance. The Combat Programmers don't deal too much damage compared to the M Guards, but they still rack up [[Corruption]] quite quickly, and their strong hacking ability can assimilate allies. M Guards can deal massive direct damage to Cogmind and any allies around with their powerful launchers.
The guards complement each other well and protect the other bot type effectively. M Guards are reasonably susceptible to EM attacks with only 50% damage resistance, but Combat Programmers can cleanse their corruption before getting enough for a kill. The M Guards provide high damage reduction to the Combat Programmers with their [[AEGIS Remote Shield]] that makes them more difficult to kill first.
[[Heading:2]]Useful parts vs Doom Corridor[[/Heading]]
Some specific parts can be especially helpful for conquering the Doom Corridor:
[[Heading:3]][[Point Defense Systems]][[/Heading]]
Most of the damage coming from the M Guards is from their Launchers. A single [[Adv. Point Defense System]] has a roughly 2/3 chance of shooting down a Launcher shot coming in from >3 range. A second one brings that chance up to about a 90% chance to shoot down Launcher shots. This is a significant damage decrease to Cogmind if fighting solo and is absolutely crucial to keeping large groups of allies alive.
[[Heading:3]][[Exp. EM Shield]][[/Heading]]
Fairly self-explanatory, this part will reduce the offensive threat of Combat Programmers substantially.
[[Heading:3]][[Imp. Shock Absorption System|Imp]]/[[Exp. Shock Absorption System]][[/Heading]]
This is a good alternative to the Adv. Point Defense to cut down Launcher damage taken.
[[Heading:3]][[Graphene Brace]][[/Heading]]
This part is most helpful against [[Graviton Cannon]] M Guards. Blast is a scary mechanic to face, and getting an Adv. Point Defense blasted off immediately into a Launcher hit is the stuff of nightmares. It also helps a little against the Combat Programmer corruption criticals.
[[Heading:3]]Strong Thermal Cannons like [[Enh. Nova Cannon]][[/Heading]]Combat Programmers have a -25% resistance to Thermal damage and strong Cannons are the best way to exploit this. Alternatively, a thermal gun stack with good burn criticals can be used to overheat the bots to death and earn an early kill.
[[Heading:3]]Strong EM Cannons like [[Com. HERF Cannon]][[/Heading]]
After the Combat Programmers are taken down, the M Guards are vulnerable to EM damage. With high resistances all around and an additional 50% damage reduction from AEGIS, EM is the ideal way to kill here. M Guards only have 50% EM resistance, and EM corruption ignores the AEGIS damage reduction entirely. HERF can take down an M Guard in relatively few volleys.
[[Heading:3]][[Core Stripper]]/[[Disintegrator]]/[[Warp Cannon]][[/Heading]]
These weapons can instantly kill any of the Doom Corridor guards. Core Stripper and Disintegrator in particular are great at generating loot, although they have prohibitive resources costs. These are best used by airborne builds that can easily separate the guards from each other for easier looting. Alternatively, allies can be used to draw fire away from Cogmind so that the dropped loot doesn't get beat up by M Guard Launchers.
[[Heading:3]][[Firepult]][[/Heading]]
This part can single handedly melt all of the Doom Corridor bots in only a few volleys, with some lucky hits. If heat dissipation allows, using a Quantum Capacitor can help a lot to overwhelm the [[Exp. Coolant Injector|Exp. Coolant Injectors]] of the M Guards even quicker.
[[Heading:3]][[Vortex Catalyst Activator]][[/Heading]]
This launcher is uniquely good at softening up the Doom Corridor due to dealing Vortex damage, something that none of the bots resist. It may not be able to single handedly kill all the guards due to the limited number of shots it can fire, but it should get most of the way there, albeit with the cost of dropping loot to 0.
[[Heading:3]][[Microwarp Drive]][[/Heading]]
This part is very strong for slow treaded bots. Either get into line of sight or shoot with a long-ranged weapon to attract attention, then warp out of the corridor to safety. This allows for easily separating the Combat Programmers to destroy them first without any AEGIS protection. The M Guards will take a long time to make their way over.
[[Heading:3]]Defensive [[Hackware]][[/Heading]]
Defensive Hackware will reduce the chances of Combat Programmers being able to hack allies. Very useful if Cogmind has seal allies.
[[Heading:3]][[Energy Wells]] (DoCo)[[/Heading]]
Using stored energy to continue firing EM weaponry or to power expensive [[Defensive Utilities]] is always useful in combat.
[[Heading:3]]Traps[[/Heading]]
[[Fire Trap|Fire Traps]] and EM traps like [[EM Surge Trap|EM Surge Traps]] can be used to take out the Combat Programmers and M Guards respectively.
[[Heading:3]][[Relay Coupler [Proto]|Prototype Relay Couplers]][[/Heading]]
A [[RIF]] build can assimilate the M Guards with these, although the Combat Programmers are immune.
[[Heading:3]][[Field Lobotomy Kit]][[/Heading]]
The Field Lobotomy Kit can assimilate both Combat Programmers with the cost of 2 charges. They typically make short work of the M Guards afterwards.
[[Heading:2]]Doom Corridor Combat Strategies[[/Heading]]
There are several common Doom Corridor fighting strategies that depend on obtained parts and allies:
[[Image]]Command Doom Corridor MWD.png|Using a Microwarp Drive to lure the Combat Programmers away[[/Image]]
[[Heading:3]]Solo Cogmind[[/Heading]]
If Cogmind is fighting alone, it can be very effective to lure the Combat Programmers out first to kill them before the M Guards arrive. A Microwarp Drive makes this very easy to do. Without a Microwarp Drive, one strategy is to use a long ranged [[Ballistic Cannons|Ballistic Cannon]] to shoot one of the M Guards and then duck into one of the Warlord cubbyholes. The Combat Programmers will run out of AEGIS protection range to fight. With good offensive firepower, the Programmers will be destroyed by the time the M Guards catch up. If not, it is still good to finish them off before moving to the M Guards. Switch over to EM to quickly finish the M Guards. Even a weaker EM weapon like a [[Gamma Rifle]] from a [[P-80 Master]] is more effective at killing M Guards than most other damage types.
[[Image]]Command Doco Warlord Aggro.png|Path to allow Warlord to draw aggro, good with Core Stripper and Disintegrator[[/Image]]
[[Heading:3]]Seal Charge[[/Heading]]
If one or more seals have been activated, there can be a large mass of allies following Cogmind around. If grounded and slow, sometimes there are so many allies that no kind of special maneuvering is possible. In this case, charging down the Corridor is the only real choice. If possible, try to use an Adv. Point Defense or two to keep allies alive as long as possible. This strategy usually results in most or all allies getting destroyed in the fight. If Warlord is present, he will typically be the last ally standing for this type of strategy. In fact, Warlord alone can end up carrying the entire Doom Corridor fight. He has 100% EM resistance so the Combat Programmers can't hurt at all, and he has a massive amount of integrity to tank the M Guards.
One variant of this strategy is to try to sneak around the top of the Corridor with the intention of Warlord or other allies getting spotted first. This will result in the majority of allies getting Launchered out of existence very quickly, but will keep fire off of Cogmind. The tradeoff here is that it is much easier to sneak in with a Core Stripper or Disintegrator and preserve dropped M Guard loot while Cogmind is not the primary focus of the guards. Otherwise, Cogmind rushing in can result in -salvaged M Guards or existing floor loot being destroyed.
[[Image]]Command Doom Corridor Lure Setup.png|CRM Imprint seal Doom Corridor lure setup[[/Image]]
[[Heading:3]]Lure strategy[[/Heading]]
This strategy works best with fast airborne builds and/or with blue CRM-controlled Imprint seals. The general idea is to set up a killzone just outside of the Doom Corridor front doors and lure the guards to that spot. For Imprint, try to separate Experimentals in a way such that multiple Experimentals won't get hit by a single M Guard Launcher hit. If Warlord seals, try to lure the Derelicts back a little ways to give yourself some breathing room before you return. Run or Microwarp in, get the guards to follow you out, then let your allies do their thing. Ideally the M Guards don't make it out until Combat Programmers are dead, and they should suffer the same fate as the Programmers. This works better with a large number of allies, particularly Experimentals or Z-Heavies, and a wide-open area outside of the Doom Corridor. This usually results in much fewer ally casualties due to bots rushing in front of each other and getting in each others' way, blocking LOS and causing missed shots to result in friendly fire. It can be a good idea to hide behind a wall for a bit after luring the guards since they will prioritize Cogmind first and take a while to switch into attacking other hostiles.
[[Heading:3]]Trap strategy[[/Heading]]
This strategy works best with fast airborne builds or tread builds with the Microwarp Drive. Use Fire Traps first to take out the Combat Programmers. 1-2 should result in a heavily disabled or entirely melted down Programmer. A thermal weapon can be used to trigger the full meltdown of a bot in critical range to begin with. After the Programmers are dead, place down any type of EM-damaging or corruption trap. EM Surge Traps work best. 2-3 of these will take down an M Guard alone. Use of a [[Trap Extractors|Trap Extractor]] is helpful to preserve inventory space.
[[Heading:3]]Assimilation strategy[[/Heading]]
Using RIF with Prototype Relay Couplers is an easy way to handle some bots in the Doom Corridor. However, Combat Programmers are immune to all RIF effects, which makes this strategy a little awkward. After taking out the Combat Programmers by whatever means are available, 26 charges of these couplers will assimilate the 2 M Guards.
[[Heading:2]]Accessing MAIN.C[[/Heading]]
MAIN.C is locked behind a very powerful [[Reinforced Walls#command|sealed barrier with 80 armor]]. The Terminal has a high base success rate of 60% but may not always be available. If Cogmind has hit High Security or if the Terminal is blown up while fighting the Doom Corridor, alternative methods must be used to gain entry.
Powerful Thermal weaponry including [[Cld. Nova Cannon]], [[Null Cannon]], [[Potential Cannon]], [[Imp. Potential Cannon]], and [[Core Cannon]] can be used to dig through the center. An high rating reactor explosion from an [[Electromagnetic Launchers|Electromagnetic Launcher]], such as the [[Shock Bomb Launcher]] sometimes available on [[Warlord D3-CKR]], can destroy a few wall tiles at a time. [[Plasma Cutters]] can be used to disassemble the Sealed Barrier as well. Another alternative is to skip through the barrier with a [[Spacefold Activator]], or to dig around it using a [[Matter Drive]], [[LU-1G1's Laser Shovel]], or [[Terrabomb]].

[[Heading]]MAIN.C Strategy[[/Heading]]
After bypassing the Doom Corridor in one way or another, the big boss MAIN.C lies ahead. The [[MAIN.C (Shell)|first form]] is the easier of the two. It is easier to hit, has weaker weapons, lacks some resistances that the second phase has, and has no strict timer. However, the disruption effects on the [[Hpw. Disruptor Cannon|Hpw. Disruptor Cannons]] can be quite annoying, especially for builds that are very close to the support limit or builds with few weapons. Consider [[Dynamic Insulation Systems]] or [[Shieldings]] to protect crucial parts from Disruption.
However, the [[MAIN.C|second phase]] is much scarier. This form deals much more damage, has a 20% blast from the [[Omega Cannon]], gains Thermal and Explosive resistance, becomes much quicker at 34 speed. Most importantly, this form puts Cogmind on a time limit since the Command Garrisons become active. Linger too long and hoards of 0b10 bots will come into the room.
[[Heading:2]]Useful parts vs MAIN.C[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:3]]Strong Kinetic, Entropic, or Vortex weapons[[/Heading]]
Phase two is 75% resistant to Thermal damage and Explosive damage, and 100% EM resistant. That only leaves melee weapons and the aforementioned ranged damage types capable of realistically taking him down. While superweapons or allies can help take him down easily, 4 [[Linear Accelerator|Linear Accelerators]] backed with offensive utilities is enough to win. Some other good weapon choices are: [[Hcl. Linear Accelerator]], [[Multirail]], [[Graviton Cannon]], [[Omega Cannon]], [[Zio. Phaser-H]], [[Zio. Alpha Cannon]], [[Zio. Alpha Cannon Mk. II]], [[Vortex Cannon]], [[Vortex Driver]], [[Vortex Rifle]], [[Vortex Shotgun]], [[Sigix Sheargun]], and [[Sigix Shearcannon]].
[[Heading:3]][[BFG-9k Vortex Edition]][[/Heading]]
This unique weapon deserves a special mention of its own. This will always kill with 2 core hits and even guarantees the kill in one with a single [[Adv. Particle Charger]].
[[Heading:3]][[L-Cannon]][[/Heading]]This weapon is also very unique. The completed L-Cannon is capable of killing MAIN.C in a single hit, and with good aim, can even destroy both phases in a single volley. Due to MAIN.C's fixed location and the L-Cannon's unique infinite range, it is possible to camp out in the corner of the map and destroy phase one safely out of sight. If MAIN.C survives into phase two, Cogmind can just wait around until he comes into range to finish the job.
[[Heading:3]][[Graphene Brace]] (MAIN.C)[[/Heading]]
Phase 2's 20% blast from the Omega Cannon can blast parts off of Cogmind, causing wasted time re-equipping parts or destruction of critical utilities. Graphene brace completely negates this risk.
[[Heading:3]][[Imp. Utility Shielding|Imp.]] or [[Exp. Utility Shielding]][[/Heading]]
These will protect vital utilities and also protect utility parts from getting blasted by phase two.
[[Heading:3]]A strong Launcher[[/Heading]]
while MAIN.C himself is highly resistant to Launchers, the Garrison ARCs can wander into the room and drop a bunch of bots on top of Cogmind. It can be worth swapping to a Launcher to finish off that group before switching back to MAIN.C.
[[Heading:3]]Chance to hit core utilities[[/Heading]]
Specifically, [[Core Analyzers]] and [[Armor Integrity Analyzers]]. Since killing MAIN.C quickly is the highest priority, these utilities are greatly appreciated to cut down time to kill. Killing quicker also has a stacking effect. The less time MAIN.C is alive, the less time he has to regenerate core, and the fewer overall core damage is required.
[[Heading:3]]Kinetic resistance[[/Heading]]
For example, [[Resistance Devices|Focal Shields]] or kinetic [[Resistance Armor]] like the [[Hvy. Reactive Plating]]. Being able to cut down on the kinetic damage dealt by phase two can help a lot. Hvy. Reactive Plating in particular can be acquired on the map from [[Warlord 4Z-XS3]]
[[Heading:3]]Any Remote [[Datajacks|Datajack]][[/Heading]]
The A7 MAIN.C hack can only be delivered with a manual hack performed with a Datajack.
[[Heading:3]][[Energy Wells]] (MC)[[/Heading]]
Powering Force Fields or expensive Energy Cannons can require a lot of energy, and storing some in advance is always helpful. Consider pre-dropping energy wells so that energy is available when needed.
[[Heading:3]][[Matter Compressors]] or [[Tractor Beams]][[/Heading]]
Kinetic weapons, especially [[Ballistic Cannons]], can eat through stored matter very quickly. Without a good way to replenish it mid-combat, Cogmind can run out of matter entirely. Phase one will typically drop a large amount of matter that can be gathered mid-combat with a Tractor Beam. Matter Compressors do a good job of storing matter ahead of time. [[Exp. Matter Compressor|Exp. Matter Compressors]] can be looted from M Guards earlier. In a pinch, [[K-01 Serf|K-01 Serfs]] can carry [[Med. Matter Pod|Med. Matter Pods]]
[[Heading:2]]MAIN.C Combat Strategies[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Command Warlord Seal MC Attack.png|Charging MAIN.C with Warlord Cave seal allies[[/Image]]
There are not too many strategies for killing MAIN.C. The majority of the work is going to be in the initial setup and not necessarily in the actual fight. The typical course of action is to step into the room, use the MAIN.C hack (if obtained this run), take a few steps into the room, and [[Siege Mode|siege]] up if wearing Treads. After that just start shooting. Phase one can be destroyed with thermal weapons to preserve matter for Kinetics or integrity for Vortex weaponry. When phase one is almost destroyed, it can be worth pre-switching to the phase two build to ensure minimum delay between phase two summoning the Garrisons and MAIN.C dying.
[[Heading:2]]Post-kill[[/Heading]]
After the kill, a large portion of the 0b10 forces will begin to turn on each other. However, it is not safe yet as both 0b10 factions will still try to fight Cogmind. Grab whatever loot there is from MAIN.C (make sure to grab the [[MAIN.C Data Core]]) and decide what to do next. If Warlord is still alive, getting within line of sight of him will result in a W7 ""Establishing Free Derelict Territories"" win. Otherwise, there are two main options here:
[[Heading:3]]Hide in the MAIN.C room[[/Heading]]
Digging through the machinery to hide in the corners of the room can avoid getting spotted by the remaining 0b10 forces. This is most effective with a weapon that can dig into the 100 armor Reinforced Barriers around the room. Otherwise, the machinery tends to get destroyed over time and Cogmind will eventually become exposed. Digging and hiding in the walls is a little safer, just be sure not to get caved in on. Either way, just wait out the 600 turns until all of the remaining bots are disabled.
[[Heading:3]]Heading to the left side of Command[[/Heading]]
There are some 0b10 bots wandering around the left side, but much fewer than the ones on the right side. Usually, a little fighting is required to head this way. Hiding out in one of the corners on the left side here is much safer than trying to hide in the corners of the MAIN.C room without being able to properly dig. There is a much smaller chance of wandering bots discovering your hiding spot. The Command cache is a great safe spot to hide in.
If surrounded by a lot of hostiles, one potential strategy is to drop all parts except for the propulsion and try to return later. Core hovering with propulsion armor can be an effective way to escape to left side of Command.
After the bots are disabled, there are two more options to take. Either take one of the surface exits now, or break the Wave Inhibitor machine, loot the map, and teleport to Access_0. If going to Access_0, there is plenty of good loot on the ground or still on unpowered bots. Some of the nicer targets for looting are [[Executioner|Executioners]], [[Alpha 7|Alpha 7s]], [[B-99 Colossus|Colossi]], and both forms of MAIN.C. The Command cache also has plenty of strong prototype parts that will help out.","Redacted","","","","","",""
"Strategy/Defeating Superfortress","Other","[[Image]]Protoforge Superfortress.png|Dormant Superfortress in Protoforge[[/Image]]
[[Superfortress]] in [[Protoforge]] is arguably the strongest robot in the game with powerful offenses that easily out-damage other endgame bosses and a defensive profile including resistances to most common damage types, an efficient [[Exp. Force Field]], near immunity to launchers with the [[Cep. Antimissile System]], and regenerating core integrity and parts. Killing Superfortress is a feat that can only be accomplished by incredible offensive firepower, either through Cogmind's own power or by overwhelming numbers. Even after getting the kill, the punishment includes much more dangerous future floors and an immediate triggering of [[High Security]] unless the UFD assault has begun. Builds should be in peak condition to even consider attempting the kill.

[[Heading]]Overwhelming Firepower[[/Heading]]
There are a few main ways that Cogmind can single-handedly output enough damage to take out Superfortress in a reasonable amount of time. These approaches typically require rare weapons, a difficult to sustain amount of heat dissipation and matter stockpile, and a generally fantastic build.
[[Heading:2]]Triple [[Linked Autogun|Linked Autoguns]][[/Heading]]
Linked Autoguns can be obtained in bulk by killing [[Tracker|Trackers]] after using the [[Data Conduit]]. The [[Cep. Thermoelectric Network]] is ideal to reduce the amount of cooling utilities required to sustain fire, but stacking multiple [[Adv. Coolant Injector|Adv]] or [[Exp. Coolant Injector|Exp. Coolant Injectors]] can work too. 3 of these puts the firing delay at 25 which is the lowest possible value.
[[Heading:2]]Ovr. Weapon Stack[[/Heading]]
Ovr. weapons, especially the top tier [[Ovr. Railgun]], [[Ovr. Quantum Rifle]], [[Ovr. Linear Accelerator]], and [[Ovr. Nova Cannon]], can be easily obtained in bulk from the [[UFD]] bots during the [[Protoforge#w9_defending_0bprimeufd_assault|UFD assault]]. 8 of these will hit the delay cap of 25 delay per volley. Cep. Thermoelectric Network is a required item for this strategy because of the completely unreasonable amount of heat per turn that gets generated (easily over 1000 per turn).
[[Heading:2]][[Scrap Engine]][[/Heading]]The Scrap Engine can be quite unpredictable but very powerful. Larger weapon constructs, especially 4 slot ones, can deal absurd amounts of damage in the mid hundreds range. It is possible to build up a powerful construct before entering the map, although there are a lot of strong parts in Protoforge to help become even more overpowered. Finishing the construct with entropic or vortex damage is the best option due to the lack of resistances, but kinetic damage works reasonably well against Superfortress.
[[Heading:2]]Melee Sneak Attacks[[/Heading]]
While Fortress is [[Protoforge#dormancy|dormant]], it is possible to get free sneak attacks until the 10 turn wake up process is completed. For a powerful weapon with low delay combined with Femtoactuators, this can be a free 10 sneak attacks with no damage returned and no bots summoned. This is best for fast flight builds with a fully fabricated melee kit. Even though 10 turns is often not enough to kill, if Superfortress is brought down to only a few hundred core integrity, it is reasonable to finish the rest of the kill even under fire. While some nice melee parts are available in the lab, the more time spent back there is a higher risk that Cogmind will eventually be reported and lose the sneak attack opportunities. The best weapons for this approach are [[Vortex Lance|Vortex Lances]], [[Exp. Jetlance|Exp. Jetlances]], and the [[Superquantum Companion]].
It is still possible for a peak flight melee build to take out Superfortress while awake. However, doing so is much riskier and will cost a ton of integrity even if successful. Worst case, the build may not be intact enough to escape the map with the imminent High Security.
[[Heading:2]][[BFG-9k Vortex Edition]][[/Heading]]
The BFG deals a huge amount of entropic damage which is one of the few damage types that isn't resisted by Superfortress. The weapon damages itself with use and it has a tendency to tank lots of damage from high coverage, so protecting it with defensive utilities is a must. [[Exp. Weapon Shielding]] can be looted from [[Hotshot|Hotshots]] and is a great choice to keep it alive long enough to secure the kill.
[[Heading:2]][[Vortex Shotgun|Vortex Shotguns]][[/Heading]]
The Vortex Shotgun is another powerful source of Entropic damage. It is much less flashy than the BFG, but easier to support with lower vulnerability and resource costs. Two of these (keeping only one attached at a time) coupled with a [[Quantum Capacitor]] and [[Exp. Target Analyzer]] can deal good damage to Superfortress. With the Target Analyzer, each of the 3 projectiles has a 15% chance to explode an engine, hurting Superfortress as well as any nearby bots that were summoned. While Superfortress has no engines, it can't fire back on Cogmind due to the high energy upkeep of its utilities which can massively cut down on the amount of damage taken during the fight.
[[Heading:2]]Protoforge Kinetics Build[[/Heading]]
It is possible for a more ""standard"" build to defeat Superfortress without any unique parts or gimmicks, although it will be extremely difficult compared to all other methods. Trying to fight Superfortress ""fairly"" tends to be a recipe for disaster, but with enough Protoforge parts, it is possible to win single-handedly. The best possible build includes multiple [[Cep. Helical Railcannon|Cep. Helical]] or [[Cep. Heavy Railcannon|Cep. Heavy Railcannons]], at least 4 or more slots worth, with an Exp. Kinecellerator, combined with other standard offensive and defensive combat utilities like [[Core Analyzers]], [[Weapon Cyclers]], and [[Armor Integrity Analyzers]]. Be aware that this will be an uphill battle throughout.

[[Heading]]Overwhelming Numbers[[/Heading]]
There are also strategies that involve use of allies to overwhelm Superfortress instead of only relying on Cogmind's own damage output. Most standard allies are not suitable for this purpose for a few reasons. First and foremost, Superfortress can assemble a variety of launcher if Cogmind has many allies. Most army strategies quickly fall to the top tier launchers that he can assemble, especially the unique [[Gamma Driveblaster]]. A Cep. Antimissile System can mostly negate this downside. The other major downside is the increased assembling rate of Superfortress bots when allies are around. Without adequate firepower, it may quickly turn out that Superfortress's army outnumbers Cogmind's own. Ideal allies are independently strong/tanky, extremely numerous, or bots with Impale criticals to help to lock Superfortress down so that it can't take actions.
[[Heading:2]][[Immortal|Immortals]][[/Heading]]
Immortals have a fast attack rate, high Impale crit rate, and can be assimilated in the map with [[RIF]] by using [[Relay Coupler [Proto]|Proto Relay Couplers]], so they make great choices for allies. 4 Immortals can keep Superfortress from attacking most of the time, and the 5th will typically allow Superfortress to be permanently stunned via impale criticals. Be aware that Superfortress can still assemble bots in this state, so it is not a totally safe kill, especially if the assembled bots start to kill off Immortal allies. Focus on keeping the assembled allies off of the Immortals and they will finish Superfortress off.
[[Heading:2]]Liberated [[K-01 Serf|K-01 Serfs]] (Yes Really)[[/Heading]]
Serfs that are assimilated by [[IN-MT5's Pitchfork ""Insurrection""]] will become armed with a [[Shield Trident]], a ranged 100% Impale weapon. While the damage on these weapons are not particularly high, they can permanently lock Superfortress down just like Immortals. 4 or more is recommended to maintain the lockdown. Try to keep as much fire off of the Serfs as possible, as even with the Shield Trident they are still fairly fragile.
[[Heading:2]]UFD Army[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Protoforge Teleported Superfortress.png|Superfortress teleported into the UFD army[[/Image]]
The UFD assault from the event contains numerous strong bots, especially [[Triborg (Optimus)]] and [[Scraphulk|Scraphulks]], and are perfect for eliminating Superfortress. The hardest part is getting them to meet in a favorable position. There are 2 main strategies to use the army against Superfortress:
[[Heading:3]]Superfortress Lure[[/Heading]]
This strategy involves luring Superfortress out of its initial spawn position down to the place where the army pops out in the forge area. Either pop in and out of sight or hit with a long-ranged weapon to continue to retain aggro on Superfortress. This strategy is best performed on a fast airborne build to stay out of weapons range most of the time. After Superfortress is near position, initiate the event at a Recycling Unit.
[[Heading:3]][[Supercharged TR]][[/Heading]]
By using a [[Dimensional Node Initializer]] with a Supercharged TR, Superfortress can be brought to the center of the forge where the assault is happening. Plant the Node close to the incursion point at the bottom right of the map, engage the event, and then rush over to Superfortress. If Cogmind is fast enough, the teleport will leave Superfortress surrounded by the initial assault of UFD bots. This strategy is most effective with high UFD readiness.
[[Heading:2]]Fabricated Army[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Protoforge Fabricated Army.png|Reasonably sized fabricated army of Hunters and Duelists (10 Authchips)[[/Image]]
Fabricating a bot army is a relatively difficult strategy to pull off. For optimal results, Superfortress must stay dormant for the entire process so that all fabricated bots can be adjusted into position before starting the fight. If the bot army has to approach an awake Superfortress, there is little chance of success since bots will only slowly trickle into range. For this reason, a Jamming Amplifier is highly recommended to avoid any jamming failures.
There are 4 level 3 [[Fabricator|Fabricators]] in the forge section of the map that can allow for very rapid fabrication with a lot of [[Authchip [R/Combat]]]. The [[H-88 Terminator]] is arguably the best bot to fabricate for the Superfortress kill due to its high core integrity, damage output, and evasion. A few [[L-61 Swordsman|L-61 Swordsmen]] are also a good addition thanks to their high damage output that isn't resisted, although only a limited amount of melee bots can fit around Superfortress, so there is a practical limit to them.

[[Heading]]Other Useful Items[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:2]][[Cep. Rapid Grenade Launcher]][[/Heading]]
While not capable of taking down Superfortress single-handedly, this part deserves a special mention. Most kill strategies will take long enough for Superfortress to assemble an army of bots that will wear Cogmind down. The Cep. Antimissile System prevents easy launchering of the growing army. However, the Cep. Rapid Grenade Launcher's unique effect bypasses this part, making it one of the few ways to quickly take out a group of Superfortress-assembled bots at once.

[[Heading:2]][[PL-3XN's Obliterator]][[/Heading]]
The Obliterator is another weapon that is worth mentioning independently. While it has high damage, its limited number of shots and very high matter cost makes it unsuitable for a full kill. Still, its ability to rip components off of any target makes it very valuable for nearly all kill strategies. The only parts that the Obliterator will fail to rip off are the [[Exp. Heavy Siege Treads]], [[Centrium Heavy Armor Plating]], and any 2-slot weapons that happen to be assembled. It rips off all power and all defensive utilities each time it is fired, dramatically reducing Superfortress's offensive and defensive capabilities. Its secondary instant-kill effect can also clear up any assembled hostile bots nearby.

[[Heading]]Escaping the Map[[/Heading]]
After Superfortress is dead, there is still the remaining issue of leaving the map in one piece. Unless the UFD assault has begun, High Security will begin to activate as Superfortress dies. The ideal strategy in this case is a Dimensional Node Initializer placed near the exit. Airborne builds can usually make it to the exit before the first wave of assaults spawn due to their high speed. For grounded builds without these options, be prepared to fight through multiple waves of High Security while heading to the exit. [[Sterilization]] not being an option on this map means that there is no possibility to siege up and fight until the end.","Redacted","","","","","",""
"Strategy/Extension","Other","[[Image]]Extension Guide Route.png|Recommended path through Extension[[/Image]]
[[Extension]] is a straightforward map with little variation between runs. The typical strategy is a fairly simple one:
[[List:Ordered]]
From the spawn location, take the path to the top-left of the map. Travel along the right and destroy any hostiles. Rewiring and freeing bots in cells is an option at this point, but it is usually better to wait to do this to keep [[Alert]] lower and to preserve ally integrity for the center fight.|
Once reaching the middle of the map vertically, head back to the beginning area rather than continuing down. The 1 tile corridor tends to get too congested and favors the [[0b10]] defenders there. Free or rewire any remaining allies along the way, then take the army and charge into the center of the map from below. Here, the open corridor allows for better lines of fire for the army.|
Assuming the fight went reasonably well at this point, the remainder of the map should be a breeze to run through. Free and rewire any allies on the top right of the map and then head down to the exit.
[[/List]]

[[Heading]]Extension Dig[[/Heading]]
One alternative to fighting through the center of the map is to dig across through the top. This is typically a 10 tile dig, which has a reasonable risk of cave-ins occurring. If there were few allies gained or they were destroyed, or if Cogmind's offensive ability is very low, this alternative route may be preferable. Beware [[Cave-ins]] this way.","Spoiler","","","","","",""
"Strategy/Hub_04(d)","Other","Blowing up Network Hubs in [[Hub_04(d)]] can be very valuable to the run thanks to the huge defensive hacking bonuses provided. However, destroying one as soon as you see one by shooting immediately is usually a bad idea. Shooting them directly causes a ton of [[Alert]] around the order of several hundred due to their large destructive radius. The [[Lightning]] squads that follow can also be very scary for an unprepared Cogmind. It is often a better idea to blow up the Hubs from a distance, especially when right next to exit.

[[Heading]]Explosion Methods[[/Heading]]
There are a lot of methods to blow up Network Hubs that do not trigger the alert gain:
[[Heading:2]]Hostile attack[[/Heading]]
If a bot stands in front of a Network Hub and an [[0b10]]-aligned bot misses into it, the destruction will be associated with that bot and not Cogmind. This works especially well with allies and drones. Position the ally in front of a Hub and attacking enemies can shoot around or through them to trigger the explosion. The Lightning [[EMDS]] has a 100% penetration, so any allies standing in front of a Hub is sure to get it to explode.
[[Heading:2]][[Traps|Trap]] explosion[[/Heading]]
Traps never assign Alert to Cogmind unless manually triggering the trap. Any explosive or area EM traps will work, [[I]]but[[/I]] if the trap triggers due to Cogmind's [[Corruption]] then the alert isn't assigned, which can be used to avoid the alert. For example, plant a [[Dirty Bomb Trap]] and then walk back and forth over it. Eventually, this will trigger the trap to explode.
[[Heading:2]][[Plasma Cutter|Regular]] or [[Imp. Plasma Cutter]][[/Heading]]
Plasma Cutters can destroy explosive machines like Hubs without triggering the explosion. This can be nice for for Cogmind to avoid being caught out in the open in a bad defensive position. Because the majority of the Alert gained from destroying a Hub is from the explosion, this will reduce the typical several hundred Alert gain down to just 15.
[[Heading:2]]Force(Sabotage)[[/Heading]]
If successful, this hack will blow up a random explosive machine on the map. Network Hubs are the only available targets in this map, so this will always hit a Hub if successful. However, this hack is inconsistent and may fail multiple times in a row. It does cause an Alert gain of 50 if successful, but it is substantially less than the several hundred of a manually-blown Network Hub. Note: unlike this hack, Trojan(Detonate) does cause Alert to go up from the Explosion and is not a great hack to use.

[[Heading]]Lightning[[/Heading]]
4 squads of these will appear after blowing up any Hubs. They can be defeated with combat or evaded.
[[Heading:2]]Combat[[/Heading]]
The best way to deal with the Lightning squads is to use critical destroy weapons as they lack any critical immunity. [[8R-AWN's Boregun]], [[Adv. KE Penetrator]], or [[Hyp. Weapons]] work well. [[Damper Plating]] works great at reducing damage taken by Lightnings to negligible amounts. The [[Exp. EM Shield]] that they carry is a lot less effective than Damper Plating, but is still a substantial reduction and only costs 1 slot.
[[Heading:2]]Evasion[[/Heading]]
Lightning have Scan Cloak 5 which makes them entirely undetectable by [[Sensor Arrays]]. However, there are still some methods that can be used to track them:

"Strategy/Looting Protoforge","Other","While [[Protoforge]] contains a staggering array of high powered parts, collecting all of them is one of the most difficult challenges in the game. There are many ways for things to go wrong on the map. If they do, the layout of the map is highly unforgiving, and an emergency escape may not always be possible. Combat builds may run into issues like taking lots of damage getting past [[Superfortress]], being forced to fight every bot in the back area leading to [[Alert]] or attrition issues, and getting scanned by [[Researcher|Researchers]]. Stealthier builds, especially [[Flight Units|Flight]] builds, can find it difficult to take the many powerful [[Prototype Robot|Prototype Robots]] in combat, to lose bots due to the lack of escape options in the map layout, and can often get stuck in stasis traps in a bad position.
[[Heading]]Getting In and Out[[/Heading]]
The first two questions to consider when entering Protoforge are the following: How will I get into the back where all the good loot is? How will I get back out? While stealthing past a dormant Superfortress is ideal, this is not always a viable approach for every build. Fully safe stealthing requires a specific and energy-intensive set of [[Infowar]], and bad [[Operator]] placement can always wake up Superfortress even for the most well prepared build. Additionally, once inside, there are jamming-immune [[V-Series]] that will always wake Superfortress. There are a few main strategies available here:
[[Heading:2]]Stealthing Past Superfortress[[/Heading]]
Stealthing past dormant Superfortress can be somewhat consistently achieved with either of 2 sets of specific utilities. An [[Adv. Transmission Jammer]] or better combined with an [[Adv. Cloaking Device]] or better will reduce the visual range of most bots in the starting area down to the jamming range, with the exception of the [[Overlord]] which can be usually be seen ahead of time due to its [[Exp. Active Sensor Suite]]. However, due to a quirk in line of sight calculation, a [[Visual Processing Units|Visual Processing Unit]] must be used in order to jam [[Watcher|Watchers]] at 16 tiles. Otherwise, Watchers can see Cogmind at 16 tiles but Cogmind cannot see them back, so the jammer does not apply. The other approach is an [[Adv. Visual Processing Unit]] or better combined with an [[Exp. Transmission Jammer]], although this approach is a little more likely to run into the Overlord. [[Transmission Jammers]] do have a chance to fail which will result in Superfortress powering up anyway, although this chance can be eliminated with a Jamming Amplifier. As previously mentioned, an Operator can also still make it to a [[Terminal]] and report Cogmind when turning a corner. Some form of bot detection like [[Sensor Arrays]] is always helpful to avoid unnecessary combat and risk of jammer failure.
Due to jamming-immune bots inside the back lab area, a full stealth entry and exit is unlikely to happen. Another method will typically be required to exit the map.
[[Heading:2]]Digging Around Superfortress[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Protoforge Dig 1.png|Digging from the top left room[[/Image]]
[[Image]]Protoforge Dig 2.png|Digging from the Superfortress hallway[[/Image]]
Digging around Superfortress is a consistent strategy that is generally preferable for grounded combat builds and less so for airborne builds because [[Cave-ins]] tend to be much more dangerous for more fragile airborne builds. This strategy involves getting a strong enough digging weapon or other digging utility to bypass the standard Superfortress-guarded opening. The downsides of this approach are the potential for multiple cave-ins and the summoning of 2 additional patrols to the map once the reinforced barrier is breached. However, for most combat builds, this solution can be safer than running all of the way past Superfortress.
When performing the dig, ideally the path should be at least 2 tiles wide to avoid having to continue shooting while already in the dug out tiles in case one of the tiles collapses while walking past it. There are two best digging spots, although one is seed-dependent. The ideal digging spot is from the top left of the map. Occasionally, the map will create a room that is very close to the bottom left prototype vault. Digging from that location can be quite short, although it is not guaranteed to be there. The next best spot is to dig from the Superfortress hallway up into the Garrison room above.
[[Heading:4]]List of Parts That Can Dig[[/Heading]]

[[Heading:2]]Teleporting past Superfortress[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Protoforge Navigation Harness.png|Possible Cep. Navigation Harness teleport paths[[/Image]]
A few special items can allow for teleporting past Superfortress. Typical [[Transdimensional Reconstructor|Regular]] and [[Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor|Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructors]] can be unreliable for getting inside the lab, but there are alternate approaches to teleporting. The [[Personal Teleporter v0.10]] and [[Telecube]] both allow directional teleportation past Superfortress, albeit with a cost of random part loss.
For exiting the map, Transdimensional Reconstructors can really shine. A [[Dimensional Node Initializer]] placed near the exit will make for an easy escape route while deep in the lab. In fact, this is the best strategy for exiting the map due to the low cost and risk of the approach. There is even a spare Transdimensional Reconstructor available inside the [[Tinkerer]] lab for this use, although the Dimensional Node Initializer must be carried in from [[Quarantine]] or [[Caves]].
Another solution for teleporting out of the map is also contained within the Tinkerer lab. The [[Cep. Navigation Harness]] is difficult to use correctly, but can be used to jump outside of the lab, bypassing Superfortress. Cogmind can influence the teleport direction by making continuous moves in the same direction. Since this part's teleport works through walls, it can be used to bypass large portions of the level that would otherwise require a longer unfavorable route or digging.
[[Heading:2]]Walking Past Superfortress[[/Heading]]
Walking past an awake Superfortress can be a dangerous proposition, but sometimes is a necessity. Airborne builds, especially with overloadable propulsion, can get by with only a few volleys sent their way. However, grounded builds will take substantially more damage trying to do this. Evasion parts like [[Phase Shifters]], [[Reaction Control Systems]], and [[Thunder Leg|Regular]] or [[Imp. Thunder Leg|Imp. Thunder Legs]] can help reduce damage taken greatly.
After Superfortress has been bypassed, keep running and don't stop to fight any bots following or else there is a risk that Superfortress will catch up and reset its 20 action memory. The best place to go after running past Superfortress to enter the back lab is into the Garrison room, out of sight. When leaving, keep going to the corner where the corridor turns back downward again.
[[Heading:2]]Exiting Through the Garrison[[/Heading]]
While it is often desirable to close the [[Garrison Access]] to avoid prototype reinforcements, there is always the option to leave through it instead. Research [[Garrison|Garrisons]] are quite tough and can add lots of Alert, although this option may be more preferable for [[RIF]] builds.
[[Heading]]Propulsion Choice[[/Heading]]
While all propulsion types can be used to loot Protoforge, [[Hover Units|Hover]] and [[Legs]] are generally the best suited for the job. [[Treads]] have a major integrity issue in the map, with only one rarely spawning type of propulsion available in the propulsion vault ([[Exp. Heavy Siege Treads]]). Treads players should expect to bring multiple backup treads into the map or switch to a different propulsion type later. Flight has more types of propulsion available, but it struggles heavily to be both combat capable to take out the prototype guards and have enough storage to take out as many parts as it wants to. [[Wheels]] are generally niche already, and the lack of good wheels on the map doesn't help the issue.
Legs and Hover serve as ideal mid-ground propulsion types. They have plentiful high integrity multi-slot parts available in the propulsion vault and have good support and carrying capacity. They both also make great use of the [[Cep. Antigrav Storage Unit]], something that treads doesn't need and flight struggles to support at times. Additionally, both legs and hover have high-rating drop from some of the common guards. Legs are dropped by [[AP7-3|AP7-3s]], [[Hotshot|Hotshots]], and [[Immortal|Immortals]], while Hover is dropped by V-Series.
[[Heading]]Looting the Lab Area[[/Heading]]
After successfully infiltrating the lab, it's time to begin collecting loot.
[[Heading:2]]Helpful Looting Items[[/Heading]]
[[List]]
[[Crosscalibrator]]: Many of the prototype parts in the lab are faulty but appear in multiples. Any part that has multiple copies can be fixed by the Crosscalibrator. A [[Subatomic Replicator]] can duplicate a rare faulty part to create two good parts.|
[[Plexus Tether]]: The Plexus Tether will identify all prototype parts on the map with the downside of summoning a Decapitator squad if the Garrison is open. If the Garrison is shut, however, this intel is completely free.|
[[Graphene Brace]]: Decapitators and Immortals have scary high critical effect percentage weapons, inflicting sever and impale respectively.|
Transmission Jammers: Jamming the dormant guards in each area can allow for picking them off one at a time instead of all at once.|
Powerful Digging Items: Digging through the walls of the map can allow for getting into vaults without being spotted by Researchers. The Cep. Plasma Driver located on the map is a good choice. A [[Warp Cannon]], while unable to dig, can serve a similar purpose by shooting around walls.|
[[Cloaking Devices]]: Cloaking serves dual purposes. One benefit is to allow firing in rooms where Researchers are present without getting spotted. Another is to see patrols roaming the lab area before they see Cogmind. [[Visual Processing Units]] can help provide the same benefit, but don't help in opening vaults like Cloaking does.|
[[Relay Coupler [NC]]]: Relay Couplers have multiple useful Researcher hacks. They can disable scanning functionality, assimilate Researchers to identify picked up prototypes, and identify all prototypes nearby instantly. A similar Researcher-disabling effect can be obtained at the Research Penetration Think tank in Scraptown.|
[[Phasing AFG]]: This part can grab loot stuck in bad positions, sometimes being able to bypass dormant guards or unfortunately-positioned Researchers.|
Plenty of backups: Due to the inconsistent placement of different vault types in the lab and the lack of normal parts on the ground, backups of essential parts are very valuable since they may show up as the last vault checked.[[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]Exploration Order[[/Heading]]
The typical route to explore the Protoforge is to head to the left side first. This allows for shutting down or destroying the Garrison Access, grabbing the Crosscalibrator, and getting the prototype IDs from the Forge Research Registry Terminal early into the map. If the Garrison is shut down or destroyed, the Plexus Tether should be used right away to minimize time spent searching for useful parts. After that, plan out which rooms are worth going into and which aren't. While it's possible to loot every vault, doing this tends to be rougher on alert and build attrition.
After leaving the left side, stick to the top of the corridor that leads back to Superfortress. The path is just wide enough to allow traversal without getting spotted. After hitting up the standard vaults on the right side, there are two more decisions to make. Are the guarded vault and Tinkerer lab worth hitting up? The guarded vault has some of the most powerful loot on the map but is also the most heavily guarded with 2 AP7-3s. The Tinkerer lab parts are not so powerful, but the Cep. Navigation Harness and Transdimensional Reconstructor can be used as ways out of the map. These parts can help avoid the extra patrols that will be summoned after entering the Tinkerer lab.
[[Heading:2]]Triggering the [[Protoforge#w9_defending_0bprimeufd_assault|UFD Assault]] Before the Lab[[/Heading]]
It is possible and sometimes even desirable to trigger the [[UFD]] assault on Protoforge before looting the Lab, even if not planning to complete the event itself. Doing this has several advantages and disadvantages. This will stop the dispatch of all [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]], [[Assault Squad|Assaults]], and even prevent [[High Security]] from occurring. Even if the UFD readiness is low, the allies can be used as distractions and sources of looting parts like [[CPS Tube|CPS Tubes]] and [[Mak. Salvage Targeting Computer|Mak. Salvage Targeting Computers]]. The tradeoff of this decision is a much more difficult Access and [[Command]] with advanced fortification protocols activated. Additionally, it may be difficult to sneak to the exit with all of the event assaults roaming around the map.","Redacted","","","","","",""
"Strategy/W8 Fortifying 0b10","Other","After defeating [[MAIN.C (Shell)]] in [[Command]], the [[Command#w8_fortifying_0b10surrender|surrender option]] may be selected instead of continuing to fight MAIN.C. A [[Core Reset Matrix]] or being [[Warlord (Alignment)|Warlord aligned]] while [[Warlord]] is alive will prevent this option from being selected.
Cogmind, MAIN.C, and the newly allied [[0b10]] bots must face off against waves of [[Enhanced Q-Series]]. These bots are mostly randomized, but there are some common qualities to them. They all have [[Adv. Dynamic Insulation System|Adv. Dynamic Insulation Systems]] which makes EM damage not a very reliable way to kill. They typically have another damage resistance utility or armor, although Kinetic and Thermal damage is usually effective. A 4+ [[Ballistic Cannons]] or [[Multirail]] stack is a good set to deal a lot of damage to these bots. The overall build requirements tend not to be too strict here. Cogmind does need to be able to put out a decent amount of damage and manage to keep a build well intact from backup parts and from Q-Series or 0b10 bot loot. MAIN.C does have a tendency to wander off and get overwhelmed at times, so try to keep up with him.
One consideration when doing this event is whether or not to go to the cache. Since Cogmind only gets 100 moves and about 40 more turns after that, it may be worth calculating the path ahead of time. If MAIN.C gets overwhelmed in the first fight, single-handedly fighting a large group of Q-Series, the event can end in failure right at the very beginning. A [[Microwarp Drive]] can help greatly here since one warp only counts as one move for the purposes of the counter.

[[Heading]]Useful parts vs. Enhanced Q-Series[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:2]][[Point Defense Systems]][[/Heading]]
Some of the Enhanced Q-Series carry powerful [[Launchers]] that are blocked by this utility.
[[Heading:2]][[Tractor Beams]][[/Heading]]
There aren't typically a lot of turns to spend running around collecting matter in this event. Being able to restock remotely can help save a lot of time and damage dealt to Cogmind.
[[Heading:2]][[Matter Compressors]]/[[Energy Wells]][[/Heading]]
Resource storage is always useful in extended combat encounters like this.
[[Heading:2]][[Launchers]][[/Heading]]
While these should be used sparingly to avoid friendly 0b10 fire that can trigger an accidental betrayal, sometimes large groups of Enhanced Q-Series will wander into the MAIN.C room at about the same time. It is very nice to be able to attack these groups simultaneously.
[[Heading:2]][[Phasing AFG]]/[[Portable AFG]][[/Heading]]
Drawing loot piles closer to Cogmind can also save a lot of otherwise wasted time trying to travel a long distance to get some good loot.","Redacted","","","","","",""
"Strategy/W9 Defending 0bPrime","Other","Assisting the [[UFD]] forces in their [[Protoforge]] assault is a task that is initially extremely challenging but can be made much easier with lots of preparation. The minimal readiness UFD will be utterly annihilated by [[0b10]] forces, leaving Cogmind up against a huge amount of bots with little assistance. On the other hand, the maximal readiness UFD can put up a solid fight against 0b10 and can even win fights well enough to plant multiple [[UFD Drillbomb|UFD Drillbombs]]. The ideal scenario is to have at least 120 Fedlink [[UFD#resource_mechanics|resources]] when beginning the event and to avoid the civil war in [[Scraptown]] which would otherwise weaken the UFD forces.

[[Heading]]Primary Strategies[[/Heading]]
There are two main strategies for this event: Stealth based and combat based.
[[Heading:2]]Stealth Bombing[[/Heading]]
Stealth is the easier option of the two to beat the event. With maximal UFD forces, Cogmind has to do little to no fighting in order to help complete the event. Instead, focus on remaining out of sight and planting Drillbombs. However, helping out the UFD forces here and there with launchers, especially guided ones like a [[Mni. Smartbomb Launcher]], can be an easy way to help out the UFD without risking too much damage. [[Flight Units|Flight]] is the ideal propulsion type for stealth thanks to its high speed, allowing for easily sneaking to Drillbomb planting locations and retreating back to friendly bots when caught in a bad position. [[Hover Units|Hover]] is still a good option since it tends to be more capable of taking on fights when needed. The lack of inventory is one of the biggest issues for flight, with a [[Med. Storage Unit]] being required to carry a single Drillbomb without any backups available. However, thanks to the massive number of Strikers that appear during this event, there will always be spare flight units.
Although rather slow, [[Impulse Thruster Array|Impulse Thruster Arrays]] have good support and integrity. Hover is much worse off here, as the only dropped hover propulsion, [[Imp. Antigrav System|Imp. Antigrav Systems]], from [[P-80 Master|P-80 Masters]] is not very impressive. The lab area has plenty of great hover units to stock up on before or during the event as needed.
[[Heading:2]]Combat[[/Heading]]
Heavy combat builds are also more than capable of completing the event, even at lower UFD resource levels. One major boon to combat builds is the amount of loot and matter generated from the attack. It's very difficult to run out of crucial build elements like power, propulsion, and weapons, although the choice of parts may not always be the most desirable. Combat builds can choose between helping out with some Drillbomb planting or fully committing fighting the 0b10 waves. If Cogmind can fight up to the exit, camping nearby and using launchers at each new 0b10 wave can be a very effective strategy.
Mass Executioner spawns guarantee a limitless supply of good offensive processors. Their [[Adv. Kinecellerator|Adv. Kinecellerators]] are also a good option for any kinetic builds. They pair well with the [[Helical Railgun|Helical Railguns]] dropped by Executioners and Ovr. weaponry dropped by the [[Scrapoid|Scrapoids]] and [[Scraphulk|Scraphulks]]. While some [[Ovr. Medium Treads]] are available from Elites, they are not all that good for the depth, so it can be problematic to restock on [[Treads]]. [[Wheel|Wheels]] builds can get the [[Ovr. Huge Scrapsphere]] from Scrapoids. [[Legs]] builds have the best options available between [[Enh. Biometal Leg|Enh. Biometal Legs]] from Executioners and [[Ovr. Armored Exoskeleton|Ovr. Armored Exoskeletons]] from Scraphulks.

[[Heading]]General Strategies[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Protoforge Alternate Dig Path.png|A good alternate path to dig out of the Protoforge area[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]]Eliminate the [[Garrison Access]][[/Heading]]
The [[Prototype Robot|Prototype Robots]] spit out from the Garrison can be a nuisance to the UFD forces. While they are not as numerous as the main [[Assault Squad|Assault]] forces, they are additional dispatches that tend to be tougher than usual bots. Shutting down or destroying the Garrison before starting the event begins is a good idea. While technically possible to do after starting the assault, running down the [[Superfortress]] hallway to shut the Garrison is pretty risky.
[[Heading:2]]Dig to Improve UFD Routing[[/Heading]]
The layout of the left part of the forge area can be quite variable from run to run. Sometimes there are multiple great routes for planting Drillbombs without having to fight off many 0b10 forces. Sometimes the map ends in a giant single hallway chokepoint where it is nearly impossible for the UFD to make any progress. Don't be afraid of digging tunnels to create alternate routes to sneak past enemy forces. Being able to dig through the Forge [[Reinforced Walls#protoforge|Reinforced Barriers (80 armor)]] is often useful since the rooms on the left side tend to back up against the Forge in multiple locations other than just the entrance.
[[Heading:2]][[Launchers|Launcher]] It Up[[/Heading]]
Don't shy away from using Launchers during the event. Launchers are always a good tool against large groups of enemies, but some of their downsides costs are high [[Matter]] use and [[Alert]] generation. During the event, there is so much matter generated that it's impossible to ever run out. Alert during the event is irrelevant and will not cause any additional responses. Keep in mind that alert will still travel to the next map if planning to exit through the main exit instead of taking the win.
[[Heading:2]]Useful Event Items[[/Heading]]
[[List]][[Cloaking Devices]]: Help traverse the map and plant Drillbombs without being spotted. [[Cep. Cloak Mesh]] is available on the map in the lab area.|
Digging parts: Digging parts strong enough to dig through the Forge Plexus area Reinforced Barriers are highly useful for getting around a chokepoint.|
Good Launchers: Protoforge Launchers in particular are some of the most powerful options in the game and can easily wipe out squads to turn the tide in favor of the UFD forces.|[[Active Sensor Suite|Regular]] or [[Exp. Active Sensor Suite]]: The [[Investigation Squad|investigation]]-summoning effect of this part is not active during the event, leaving only the upside of powerful, long ranged and unjammable sensors.[[/List]]

[[Heading]]Loot the Lab?[[/Heading]]
The back lab area of the map can provide lots of good items but may not always be worth going for. With a good build going into the map, there is a chance that going to the lab leads to losing the build instead of improving it. If alert is an issue, consider how likely it is that High Security will trigger before leaving, which will lock the event out altogether and possibly even kill the run.
If going into the lab, the other question is when? Going in before the event is a little safer since there aren't going to be any assaults wandering through the Superfortress hallway or prototypes dispatched from the Garrison, and there is the possibility that Superfortress is still dormant. After the event is begun, getting back there is more challenging, but at least there won't be any [[Extermination Squad|Extermination]] or [[Assault Squad|Assault Squads]] dispatched to the back of the lab. Depending on the UFD readiness, spending an extended amount of time in the lab can result in the UFD forces becoming overrun.","Redacted","","","","","",""
"Strategy/Wastes","Other","[[Wastes]] is a very dangerous [[0b10]] map that can easily demolish slower builds with [[C-40 Crusher|Crushers]]. Airborne builds have a fairly easy time escaping this map, but grounded builds will need a plan to escape intact.

[[Heading]]Airborne builds[[/Heading]]
If Cogmind is airborne there are lots of options available. Beelining for the exit is a good strategy when allies aren't wanted or if the EMP is on. If the EMP is off, there are most likely allies on the map. Search for [[Derelict]] allies in the larger square openings on the top and bottom of the map where they can appear. They can usually take out all of the Crushers unaided. Fast speed can also allow easy kiting of Crushers around the map. Crushers do not have the most intelligent movement and can often be baited to moving to one side of the corridor. After this, quickly cross to the other side and pass out of reach. Circling back may be needed to avoid groups of Crushers.

[[Heading]]Grounded Builds[[/Heading]]
Dealing with Crushers on slower builds is a much more daunting task. Crushers are slow moving but incredibly tanky and difficult to kill through conventional means. The high integrity of [[Damper Plating]] and low core exposure of only 15% makes kills inconsistent. One good strategy to kill them are critical destroy weapons such as a [[8R-AWN's Boregun]] and [[Hyp. Weapons]]. While the armor can't be destroyed with a crit, the core and compactor exposure are about 23% combined, and getting a single critical hit will either kill or disarm the Crusher immediately. To avoid corruption when the EMP is on, put on a [[Damper Plating]] and/or a [[Dynamic Insulation System]] as soon as possible after killing a Crusher. Another strategy is a meltdown build. 3 or more thermal guns can overheat the Crushers and cause them to melt.
[[Image]]Wastes Crusher Lure.png|Crusher loop strategy[[/Image]]Fighting Crushers head on without enough firepower can usually result in essential parts of the build getting crushed onto the floor. One way to reduce the risk is to fight the Crushers in a circle around the starting corner of the map. Dig a tunnel around the starting area and shoot Crushers through it like the image on the right. The walls in the map have 28 armor, so a thermal cannon or kinetic cannon are ideal for digging. [[Adv. Assault Cannon|Adv. Assault Cannons]] and [[Hvy. Ion Cannon|Hvy. Ion Cannons]] are both capable of doing the dig, although higher rating parts will do it better. Once the path is dug, Crushers are forced to take the long path around, giving plenty of time to get free shots off. However, this technique is a little risky as it is possible to get totally surrounded by multiple Crushers.
Sometimes the best option is simply to detach all parts and make a run for it. If the EMP is off, dropping parts in the corner of the map preemptively is a good idea. If the Derelict allies are on the map, they can clear out most of the Crushers for you so you can go back and pick up your parts later. Even if there are no allies around, being able to pick the parts that you want to take is a lot better than having all your parts crushed and being stuck with potentially only junk.

[[Heading]][[RIF]][[/Heading]]
Using RIF along with a [[Datajacks|Datajack]] and [[Relay Coupler [NC]|NC Couplers]] makes each Crusher non-hostile for 3 charges a pieces. This makes the Crushers trivial to loot for maximum salvage, although the EMP can still make the process be quite annoying. Since there are 6 Crushers, the total cost is 18 charges for the whole map. Ramming these bots when neutralized this way is safe to do if running low on matter.","","","","","","",""
"Strategy/Zion Deep Caves","Other","[[Zion Deep Caves]] is an optional challenge [[Branch]] that serves as a series of checklists. Each section of the map plays out in a similar way each time, and there are some requirements to deal with them in a consistent way. Here is a general checklist of things that will be useful throughout the map:
[[List]]
Propulsion/Weapon/Armor + backups: Lots of fighting is required in this map. Having backups of these more important parts will keep the build in fighting shape.|
[[Launchers]]: These can be used for the [[Z-Imprinter]], [[Z-Light (5)|Z-Lights]], and especially for the [[Assembled]] in the wall. Multiple backups are recommended.|
[[Electromagnetic Weapons]]: EM is the only effective way to fight [[Golem|Golems]]. EM traps like [[EM Surge Trap|EM Surge]] or [[Dirty Bomb Trap|Dirty Bombs]] can also be used, but having at least 1 EM weapon is best to be safe.|
(Optional) [[AS-neutralizer No. 17b]]: Completely neutralizes the threat of the Assembled wall.|
(Optional) Allies: Make the opening Z-Imprinter fight much easier to handle. [[A8]]'s grunt code (used at the [[Terminal]] at the entrance to the deep caves) and various friendly Zion bots make great allies.|
(Optional) Dead [[Imprinter]]: Killing the Imprinter in Zion prevents her from showing up in this map. She has no weapons in Zion so taking her out there can be an easy way to skip a big threat on this map.
[[/List]]

[[Heading]]Starting Area[[/Heading:2]]
There isn't much threat here. There can be groups of 3 Assembled that can be easily dispatched by any weapons, although Launchers are most effective.
[[Image]]ZDC Allies.png|Fighting the Z-Imprinter with allies[[/Image]][[Image]]ZDC Imprinter Launcher.png|Aiming past the Imprinter with a Launcher[[/Image]]

[[Heading]]Z-Imprinter[[/Heading]]
After entering the main open area of the map, the Z-Imprinter will spawn and head directly to Cogmind's location. 2 Z-Lights will follow the Imprinter but are much slower and will take some time to arrive. The Z-Imprinter has high evasion, 150 core integrity, and deals a large amount of damage every volley. Allies are highly recommended for this fight to help destroy her quicker and to draw fire from you. A [[Tactical Coordination Suite]] can really help out with an ally damage. [[Ranged Targeting Utilities]] or multislot treads with [[Special Propulsion Modes#Siege mode|Siege Mode]] are also recommended to be able to hit the Imprinter more frequently.
For Cogmind's build, any non-EM and non-Impact damage types will work. To get the [[Zio. Metafield Generator]], +Salvage is recommended by using guns with the best available type of [[Salvage Targeting Computers|Salvage Targeting Computer]]. Although it doesn't deal much damage, EM can be used to apply +Salvage if allies are providing enough damage output otherwise. If salvage isn't needed, using [[Explosive Launchers]] will be very effective here. Rather than aiming directly at the Imprinter, aim the launcher at a wall or at the end of its range so that the Imprinter is still hit close to the source. This will maintain a high accuracy while still dealing the bulk of the damage to the Imprinter. This technique can also be used against the Z-Lights to good effect.
After the Z-Imprinter is dead, take care that your allies don't spot the Z-Technicians by the Z-Power machine. They will almost assuredly miss into the machine and end up nuking themselves, and if you're not careful, Cogmind. Beware its large 15 tile radius.
[[Heading]]Z-Light Guards[[/Heading]]The top and bottom of the map have groups of 3 Z-Light guards. There are 2 groups on the top and one on the bottom. All of these are optional encounters. To avoid them, dig through the center of the Z-Facility and hang near the left side of the area. Enter the tunnel near the top side to avoid getting spotted by the bottom group. However, the top Z-Lights are often worth fighting because of the large number of special Zionite parts they guard. It is possible to reach the first alcove on the top right without getting spotted, but the remainder are all guarded
If Cogmind still has strong allies like Enhanced Grunts alive from the Z-Light encounter, it is possible to just charge in and fight them all at once. They are not as dangerous as the Z-Imprinter, but in large numbers they can still pack a large punch. Using Launchers is very effective on these bots since despite their evasion, they have relatively low core integrity. Using a [[Transmission Jammers|Transmission Jammer]] to lure them 1 at a time can also be an effective strategy if fighting with non-launcher weapons to preserve salvage. Without using a jammer, all 6 bots will be alerted simultaneously and come running right away.

[[Heading]]Exit Area[[/Heading]]
Same as the starting area, the only threat here is small groups of 3 Assembled.

[[Heading]]Golems[[/Heading]]
Golems are incredibly tanky enemies with an extreme damage output and the source of many lost runs. In order to claim a GOLEM Unit or the Exiles item, Cogmind must fight or at least run past them. With a 10% core exposure, 200 core integrity, and 15% damage resistance to non-melee damage types, trying to kill with core damage is completely impractical. The best approach is EM damage or Impact. Golems only require an average of 118 damage to corrupt them to death compared to thousands of damage with non-EM weapons. Using [[Zio. Weapon Casing|Weapon Casings]] looted earlier is helpful to preserve EM cannon integrity and avoid running out of weapons.
Due to uneven calculations for line-of-sight and weapon range, it is possible to shoot the Golems once before you are spotted at 16 range. See the Golem 1/2 spots below for reference. This allows Cogmind to wait 2 turns before shooting to avoid any movement accuracy penalties, since every turn counts particularly hard when fighting a Golem. If using EM traps, short ranged EM weapons, or Impact weapons, see the lure images for reference. This will get Cogmind spotted, likely get shot at for 1 volley, and then draw the Golem in closer. This can avoid misses or misfires opening the GOLEM Unit chambers and accidentally triggering the wall early. However, keep in mind that if Cogmind misses or if the Golem misfires into one of the chambers, the wall will open instantly. Luring the Golems out of range where they can attack the GOLEM Unit containers is recommended. The Exiles item will typically require fighting the top Golem, but getting a GOLEM unit typically requires fighting both Golems, or at least luring a Golem closer and grabbing the unit if it drops.
[[Gallery]]ZDC Golem Spot 1.png|16 range Golem 1 spot (safe with Cogmind misses)|ZDC Golem Spot 2.png|Golem 2 spot (unsafe with Cogmind misses)|ZDC Golem Lure 1.png|Golem lure 1|ZDC Golem Lure 2.png|Golem lure 2|ZDC Golem Trap 1.png|Golem trap 1|ZDC Golem Trap 2.png|Golem trap 2[[/Gallery]]

[[Heading]]Impregnable Wall[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]ZDC Wall Activation Zone.png|Approximate wall activation zone[[/Image]]
The Assembled wall is an indestructible wall containing 35 [[Assembled (4)|Assembled]] and 2 [[Assembler|Assemblers]] that will automatically open up when Cogmind gets too close to it, or if any of the GOLEM Unit chambers are destroyed. See the image on the right for a range reference. This range encompasses the GOLEM Unit containers, so fighting the wall is required to grab them.
Fighting the wall practically requires Launchers to avoid becoming overwhelmed. Any kinds of launchers work, although explosive launchers are better due to their higher base damage. Trying to use launchers at a range where they won't miss and take out the GOLEM unit containers is ideal. Otherwise it can be slightly annoying up to even deadly to have a large number of growing Golems running around. They grow slowly, but trying to deal with the Assembled and growing Golems at the same time can be a recipe for disaster. Alternately, the [[AS-neutralizer No. 17b]] can be used here to almost entirely eliminate any threat of the wall. The Assemblers will still need to be destroyed, but the rest of the Assembled will become useless.

[[Heading]]Loot[[/Heading]]
After everything else is cleaned out, all that's left is claiming the loot. Wall Chambers will drop [[GOLEM Unit|GOLEM Units]] when destroyed. They will turn into a Golem in a few turns, so grab them quickly. They can drop their GOLEM Unit upon being destroyed (standard loot rules), so applying positive and negative Salvage affects Golem reformation. Using melee weapons is recommended to avoid missing into other containers and spawning further Golems.
The Exiles item will normally require fighting both the wall and the top Golem. One alternative to grab it is using the Zion special item [[Phasing AFG]]. By using it, the item can be pulled in without any fighting on the left side of the map.","Spoiler","","","","","",""

"Strategy/aoemica's Flight Guide/Good Power","Other","Power is never exciting, but it is a necessity to all builds. The majority of energy on my flight builds typically ends up powering flight units and [[Mass Support Devices]]. In order to save mass for other essential parts, it's better to use lighter engines. It doesn't do much good to dedicate an engine that's so heavy that flight units take up all the energy needed to support it in the first place. As such, one of the most important stats for flight builds is the amount of energy that is generated compared to the mass of the engine, or the energy:mass ratio. Heat generation is also an important factor secondary factor, although it is usually easier to solve a heat problem than a support one.

[[Image]]../part_art/Backup Power VII.png|Backup Power VII, the best Backup Power[[/Image]]
[[Heading]][[Backup Power]][[/Heading]]
Backup Power is a class of relatively unassuming power that has surprising effectiveness. This is primarily due to the [[Backup Power VII]]'s incredible energy:mass ratio of 3:1. Backup Power is not very durable, can't be repaired, and can be difficult to obtain since it is only available via [[GameText]]Refit[[/GameText]] hack on a [[Repair Station]]. Backup Power VII in particular requires a level 3 Repair Station and succeeding at a base 8% success rate, so [[Hackware]] is highly recommended. Despite these downsides, Backup Power VII is a solid low mass option.

[[Heading]][[Fusion Compressors]][[/Heading]]
Fusion Compressors are unique power sources that have high energy generation at the cost of very high heat and an unusual matter cost. Fusion Compressors, especially the [[Imp. Fusion Compressor]], can support a relatively energy-hungry flight build off a single engine. If using these, take care not to run out of matter, since doing so can spell disaster. The easiest way to restock on matter is to kill non-combat bots like [[Recycler|Recyclers]] and [[Hauler|Haulers]]. In [[Caves]], look for [[Scrap]] piles to restock on matter instead.

[[Image]]../part_art/Graviton Reactor.png|Graviton Reactor, a heavy but powerful engine[[/Image]]
[[Heading]]High Mass High Energy Power[[/Heading]]
This category applies to a few mid to lategame prototype engines such as the [[Graviton Reactor]], [[Zero-point Reactor]], and [[Zio. Light DM Reactor]]. Non-prototype standard engines are often heavy and don't provide enough energy to properly support themselves. Engines in this group might not be quite so mass-efficient as lighter engines, but one advantage they have is slot compression. For example, the Graviton Reactor generates an impressive 24 energy at the cost of 15 mass. This is the energy equivalent of a [[Mic. Antimatter Reactor]] + a [[Mic. Neutrino Core]], which when combined, take up 13 mass. So at the cost of 2 extra mass, the Graviton generates the same energy in a single slot. While parts like these tend to be higher rating prototypes and are not readily available, in some cases they can help delay or prevent the need to evolve a second power slot altogether.

[[Image]]../part_art/Lgt. Fission Core.png|[[Lgt. Fission Core]], a midgame light engine[[/Image]]
[[Heading]][[Light Power]][[/Heading]]
Light Power is the standard class of flight engine in the early game. They are reasonably lighter than non-light power sources, though they do give up some integrity and energy storage for the privilege. Light power is best in [[Factory]]-depths, with engines like the [[Lgt. Deuterium Engine]], [[Lgt. Nuclear Core]], [[Lgt. Angular Momentum Engine]], [[Lgt. Fission Core]], and [[Lgt. Neutrino Core]] all serving as viable power sources. However, in later depths, light engines become more difficult to use. For example, the rating 9 [[Lgt. Quantum Reactor]], while technically a ""light"" reactor, is still 15 mass, as much as 2 endgame flight units support alone! Micro power sources are much more desirable later on for their energy:mass ratios.

[[Heading:2]][[Mak. Power Source]][[/Heading]]
For all intents and purposes, the Mak. Power Source is like an early light engine. They run a little hot for their rating, but they are a perfectly serviceable engine.

[[Spoiler]]
[[Heading]][[Meta Core]][[/Heading]]
This [[Subcaves]]-exclusive engine is among the best in the game. The durability of this part is off the charts, while the energy generation rivals the mid-lategame [[Mic. Antimatter Reactor]]. Flight can also make great use of its provided temporary slots for extended periods of time.

[[/Spoiler]]

[[Image]]../part_art/Mic. Antimatter Reactor.png|[[Mic. Antimatter Reactor]]|The best standard micro engine[[/Image]]
[[Heading]][[Micro Power]][[/Heading]]
Micro power sources are the bread and butter power sources of flight players. They have low total mass, low coverage so they don't die so quickly, and have some of the best energy:mass ratios in the game. Their overall energy generation is not particularly impressive, but they are always a solid pick.

Parts are sorted alphabetically within ranks. This tier list is not a strict comparison, since comparing a rating 3 and a rating 9 engine directly based on stats doesn't make a lot of sense.

"Strategy/aoemica's Flight Guide/Good Propulsion","Other","Good flight units are the key to the most successful flight builds. While it is possible to scrape by with any low integrity non-prototype [[Swarmer]]-tier flight units, builds relying heavily on these types of parts struggle greatly due to their fragility. [[Prototype Part|Prototype]] flight units have a large number of benefits over non-prototypes. However, that doesn't mean that non-prototypes aren't worth using. [[Flight Arrays]] and [[Surge Thrusters]] have good niches, and even typical non-prototype parts like the basic [[Flight Unit]] can be used in a pinch. Any flight unit is better than an empty slot.

[[Heading]]Effect of Rating[[/Heading]]
Higher rating parts have higher support and integrity at the cost of higher energy and heat upkeep. Unlike other propulsion types, higher rating parts are not always a superior choice. It is entirely possible to make a build off of early-game prototypes like [[Imp. VTOL Module|Imp. VTOL Modules]] and use them throughout the entire run, never opting to swap them out for higher rating parts. While this results in a lower total support limit, the tradeoff is that upkeep is very low, potentially avoiding the requirement of a 2nd power source or [[Cooling Utilities]]. Instead, these slots can be used to maximize the number of utility slots for other purposes like hacking.

[[Heading]]Prototype Flight Units[[/Heading]]
Prototype flight units are highly valuable to a flight player. Most importantly, prototypes are 2-4 times more durable than standard flight units due to their lower coverage and higher integrity. For example, compare a rating 2 flight unit [[VTOL Module]] vs a rating 2* prototype [[Imp. Flight Unit]]. The Imp. Flight Unit has an integrity:coverage ratio of 2.67, while the VTOL module has .83, meaning the Imp. Flight Unit will survive roughly 3 times as long under fire.

[[Heading]]Notable Flight Units[[/Heading]]

[[Image]]../part_art/Biomechanical Wings.png|Biomechanical Wings[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]][[Biomechanical Wings]][[/Heading]]
These flight units have extremely low upkeep and coverage at the cost of very low integrity. Biomechanical Wings can be stacked in large numbers with low upkeep costs. However, they essentially require [[Propulsion Shieldings]] because a hit from most bots will destroy them even from full integrity.

[[Heading:2]][[Cooled Flight Units]][[/Heading]]
Cooled Flight Units, such as the [[Cld. VTOL Module]], have slightly lower support than other prototypes for their rating. However, they generate 0 heat by default and additionally provide the ability to [[Overload#propulsion]] for a temporary boost of speed and support. Overloading is a great way to quickly escape from hostiles after being spotted.

[[Image]]../part_art/Diametric Drive.png|Diametric Drive[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]][[Diametric Drives]][[/Heading]]
Diametric Drives have a relatively low energy cost and high speed for their rating. However, they are on the upper end of the heat generation spectrum at +3. These parts are difficult to stack in large numbers due to high cooling requirements, but work well with Cooled Flight Units that help balance out the heat.

[[Heading:2]][[Exp. Cesium-ion Thruster|Exp. Cesium-ion]] and [[Exp. Q-thruster|Exp. Q-thrusters]][[/Heading]]
These 2 flight units are unique in their abnormally low base Time/Move. They have slightly below average support and expensive upkeep for the support they provide. Additionally, their low base speed ends up making full speed movement even harder to support. Their best niche is not in a large stack of flight units, but rather keeping the speed down for a small number of dedicated flight units. For example, they work well for the Inspector Gadget [[Achievements|Achievement]] that restricts Cogmind to only 2 propulsion slots.

[[Image]]../part_art/Nuclear Pulse Array.png|Nuclear Pulse Array, a the lowest rating flight array[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]][[Flight Arrays]][[/Heading]]
Flight Arrays, such as the [[Nuclear Pulse Array]], are 2 slot non-prototype flight units that have better than average integrity and support. They have relatively low upkeep costs and run a bit slower than their single slot counterparts due to only one application of the ""Mod/Extra"" stat. Mixing one or two arrays into a flight build is usually a good idea to improve support while lowering the overall upkeep costs of the build. Notably, the [[Impulse Thruster Array]] can be looted off of [[Striker|Strikers]] which appear in many large scale [[Derelict]] vs [[0b10]] battles.

[[Spoiler]]
[[Heading:2]][[Flightbrick]][[/Heading]]
This unique Subcaves-exclusive prototype is a great addition to any flight build. Its 3 temporary utility slots can provide great benefit throughout its lifespan, which is quite long due to its incredible 1800 integrity. The biggest drawback of the Flightbrick is its high upkeep costs, although it is still possible to support the Flightbrick at high speeds.

[[/Spoiler]]

[[Image]]../part_art/Flying Fortress v7.png|Flying Fortress V7[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]][[Flying Fortress v7]][[/Heading]]
The Flying Fortress v7 is a unique [[Exiles (Location)|Exiles]] part that has an unparalleled 12.5 support per slot which makes it great for hauling around big storage units or other heavy parts. It has  high integrity, coverage and upkeep costs. However, its 800 integrity may not last as long as it may first sound. The relatively low speed for a flight unit and high coverage make it somewhat vulnerable in the long run. Using Propulsion Shieldings can significantly improve the lifespan of this part.

[[Heading:2]][[Surge Thrusters]][[/Heading]]
Surge Thrusters are non-prototype flight units with very low support, but high coverage, integrity, and base speed. These can be looted off of [[Cutter|Cutters]], although fighting Cutters is not something to be taken lightly.
While Surge Thrusters are not very durable, one unique use of them are as makeshift propulsion armor due to their high coverage compared to other flight units. Since they are expensive to run, they don't need to be turned on at all times. Instead, keep them powered off to serve as armor at all times. Then, when needed, they can be turned on and overloaded to escape danger ASAP. Make sure to carry backups of them since they get destroyed rather quickly.

"Strategy/aoemica's Flight Guide/Good Utilities","Other","Utilities contain the most diverse range of parts in the game. This guide will not touch on every single unique kind, but strives to cover the most important ones.

[[Heading]][[Defensive Utilities]][[/Heading]]
Although flight builds should rarely engage in combat, that doesn't mean that combat is off the table entirely. When in combat, flight should try to kill bots as fast as possible and use positioning and defensive utilities (when available) to reduce damage taken. Similarly, even when not intentionally fighting enemy bots, running past them often results in a few stray shots. Many kinds of damage utilities are not especially useful for flight due to prohibitive energy or mass costs, but a few are still worth consideration, namely evasion utilities.

[[Heading:2]][[Phase Shifters]][[/Heading]]
Phase Shifters are one half of the powerful avoidance-stacking strategy. They are reasonably light, but have disproportionately high coverage compared to their integrity, and are also very energy hungry. If they can be afforded, they will provide unparalleled damage mitigation for a flight build in a single slot. Utility Shieldings are helpful for long-term use of Phase Shifters due to their fragility.

[[Image]]../part_art/Adv. Reaction Control System.png|[[Adv. Reaction Control System]], a mid-tier Reaction Control System variant[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]][[Reaction Control Systems]][[/Heading]]
Reaction Control Systems are the much, much cheaper cousin of Phase Shifters and serve as the second half of the avoidance-stacking strategy. They are similarly light and fragile, but provide a high bonus to avoidance at a very reasonably low energy cost. As an added bonus, these serve as an offensive melee tool for a permanent +1 momentum to melee attacks. If you have to pick between just one evasion utility, these are typically the better choice.

[[Heading:2]][[Shield Generators]][[/Heading]]
Shield Generators are the lighter, less effective, but more efficient cousins of the [[Force Fields]]. Force Fields don't typically fit on flight builds due to their excessive mass and energy requirements. However, Shield Generators are a much more reasonable alternative. They are typically less effective than stacking evasion utilities, but can still be a useful part of a build's damage mitigation strategy.

[[Image]]../part_art/Graphene Brace.png|Graphene Brace[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]][[Graphene Brace]][[/Heading]]
The Graphene Brace is a defensive item unlike the others in the list above. Rather than reducing damage directly, it instead prevents critical hit effects. Namely, it can be used to prevent the 2 scariest critical types of blast (primarily from [[Heavy|Heavies]] and [[Behemoth|Behemoths]]) and sever (primarily from [[Cutter|Cutters]]). The Graphene Brace does not trivialize either bot type, but it does make them much less of a potentially run-ending threat.

[[Image]]../part_art/Adv. Hacking Suite.png|[[Adv. Hacking Suite]], a mid-tier Hacking Suite variant[[/Image]]
[[Heading]][[Hackware]][[/Heading]]
Hackware is the crux of the ""flighthack"" playstyle. The speed of flight coupled with a big stack of hackware gives unparalleled control over standard 0b10 maps. Both [[Offensive Hackware]] and [[Defensive Hackware]] are valuable, although offensive hackware provides a greater benefit when being stacked in large numbers since it allows success at more difficult but powerful indirect hacks like hacks for schematics. By comparison, defensive hackware doesn't provide much value after the first one or two because its effect in reducing tracing is capped. Hacking is covered in more detail in [[Strategy/aoemica's Flight Guide/Machine Hacking]].

[[Heading]][[Infowar]][[/Heading]]
Infowar combined with high speeds is what enables flight to avoid nearly all combat throughout the game. Infowar helps detect bots, detect terrain, and identify ways to bypass hostiles, which in turns limits the need for lots of heavy combat gear or backups. Infowar is explained in detail on the dedicate page, so the following is a brief overview from a flight-oriented perspective.

[[Image]]../part_art/ECM Suite.png|ECM Suite, the basic tier type of ECM Suite[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]][[ECM Suites]][[/Heading]]
ECM Suites are a natural pair for flight. Cutting a long-tracking bot's memory in two (or more) can make major nuisance bots into much more manageable. [[Programmer|Programmers]] and [[Hunter|Hunters]] are the two standard bots with the highest memory durations of 80 and 60 actions respectively. Swapping on an ECM Suite can help avoid getting cornered in the later bot-dense maps like [[Research]].
One extra note about ECM suites is that the higher rating variants tend to be less useful for flight due to their prohibitively expensive energy costs. A single basic [[ECM Suite]] is typically enough to deal with most encounters. Although better versions are appreciated, the jump from 5 to 20 or 25 energy from [[Adv. ECM Suite|Adv.]] or [[Exp. ECM Suite]] respectively is substantial enough to consider not ""upgrading"" even when given the option.

[[Image]]../part_art/Adv. Sensor Array.png|[[Adv. Sensor Array]], a mid-tier Sensor Array[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]][[Infowar#Robot Detection|Robot Detection]][[/Heading]]
[[Image]]../part_art/IFF Parser.png|IFF Parser[[/Image]]
Robot detection is the most crucial component of infowar for a flight build. The most effective way to avoid damage is to simply never get shot at, and knowing where hostiles are is a good way of doing that. While slower builds can better get away with imprecise bot sensing like the [[Seismic Detector]], or [[IFF Parser]], I prefer more reliable bot class-detection for predictability. [[FarCom]] and standard [[Sensor Arrays]] work best.
Note for Sensor Arrays: Without an [[Exp. Signal Interpreter]], [[H-88 Terminator|H-88 Terminators]] will not appear on sensors. In this case, the Seismic Detector or IFF Parser can be used in conjunction with a standard Sensor Array in order to detect these dangerous bots. The bot markings that only appear on Seismic with nothing on Sensors are [[Hunter|Hunters]] by process of elimination.

[[Heading:2]][[Infowar#Terrain Scanning|Terrain Scanning]][[/Heading]]
[[Image]]../part_art/Structural Scanner.png|Structural Scanner[[/Image]]
Terrain scanning is a useful, yet less required source of infowar for flight builds. Being able to dig in between rooms to avoid squads in busy hallways is highly valuable, although manually digging to check the distance between rooms is always an option. Slow forms of terrain scanning, like a [[Terrain Scanners|Terrain Scanner]] without a [[Terrain Scan Processors|Terrain Scan Processor]] or with a low rating one are not very valuable for flight. The fast move speed lends better to more instant forms of infowar like the [[Structural Scanner]] or [[Machine Analyzer]].

[[Sup]]1[[/Sup]] The Machine Analyzer doesn't provide as good of pure terrain information as the ones above it, but the machine detection capabilities are unique and useful in its own right.

[[Sup]]2[[/Sup]] The Seismic Detector's terrain scanning capabilities are fairly weak, although they are instantaneous. This terrain scanning effect is most useful in Factory, since few machines in Research or later generate seismic activity.

[[Image]]../part_art/Adv. Transmission Jammer.png|[[Adv. Transmission Jammer]], an upper tier Transmission Jammer variant[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]][[Transmission Jammers]][[/Heading]]
Transmission Jammers are great for every type of propulsion, and there isn't much unique about jammer use for flight. The primary use of flight jammers, in my experience, is blocking [[Watcher]] transmissions while killing or flying past them.
Note: while not truly mutually exclusive, I find ECM Suites tend to compete with Transmission Jammers for the same inventory slot. With jamming Watchers and squads in general, it is less necessary to ECM away as many squads. With ECM, it is easier to ignore squads Watchers alert because of the reduced tracking duration. However, this is more of a note of personal preference rather than being strict advice.

[[Image]]../part_art/Enh. Optical Array.png|[[Enh. Optical Array]], a mid-tier Visual Processing Unit variant[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]][[Infowar#Vision Manipulation|Vision Manipulation]][[/Heading]]
The 2 types of vision manipulation utilities, [[Visual Processing Units]] and [[Cloaking Devices]], both are very useful for flight builds. Visual Processing Units are easier to use due to their lack of mass or energy costs, but Cloaking Devices are swappable and can be used sneak past tight corridors and into guarded machines. I personally rarely use Cloaking Devices, although I will consider taking the [[Exp. Cloaking Device]] that sometimes shows up in [[Warlord (Location)#Warlord's Stash|Warlord's Stash]]. The [[Cloak of Protection]] is a useful [[Exiles Vault Prototypes|Exiles Vault Prototype]] 2-in-1 part that combines armor and cloaking, but is energy hungry and fragile for much long-term use.

[[Image]]../part_art/Gravity Neutralizer.png|Gravity Neutralizer, a mid-tier prototype Mass Support Device variant[[/Image]]
[[Heading]][[Mass Support Devices]][[/Heading]]
Mass support is one of the biggest weaknesses of flight units, so anything to help patch that low support number up is welcome. The lower rating mass support utilities are not especially slot efficient, but the prototypes like the [[Gravity Neutralizer]] and above can be worthwhile. The top normally obtainable part, the [[Adv. Quantum Shading Machine]], is a pricy 15 energy per turn, but at 25 mass support, it's worth about 3 endgame flight units of support in a single slot. Use powerful engines like the [[Imp. Fusion Compressor]] in order to offset the energy cost of the support.

[[Image]]../part_art/Power Amplifier.png|Power Amplifier, the basic tier type of Power Amplifier[[/Image]]
[[Heading]][[Power Amplifiers]][[/Heading]]
Power Amplifiers are a mass efficient way of increasing power output while avoiding the need to evolve another power slot. These are best used with very high energy generation power like the [[Imp. Fusion Compressor]] or as a stopgap measure to delay evolving another power slot. As an example, the basic tier [[Power Amplifier]] provides 2 energy at 1 mass off of one [[Micro Power]]. Not especially powerful, but it can be enough to support a little more energy spend at a very low mass cost compared to another engine, which would take at least 3 for 5 energy with a [[Lgt. Ion Engine]].

[[Image]]../part_art/Imp. Light Armor Plating.png|Imp. Light Armor Plating, a low tier light armor variant[[/Image]]
[[Heading]]Standard [[Armor]][[/Heading]]
Boring, yet practical. Flight builds should typically wear at least one slot of armor, or at least have one in inventory to swap over some other fragile utility while being shot at. Light armors are preferred early on, particularly the [[Imp. Light Armor Plating]], but the extra coverage of a medium armor in a single slot is always appreciated if the mass support is available. Armor's overflow-absorption properties can be run-saving when running past a [[Heavy]], where otherwise a single unlucky hit can overflow and shred through multiple low integrity but essential parts.

[[Heading]][[Shieldings]][[/Heading]]
The most important shieldings for flight are [[Propulsion Shieldings]] and [[Utility Shieldings]]. While [[Power Shieldings]] and [[Weapon Shieldings]] can be used to protect unique or low integrity parts, they are rarely worth the extra slot. While not strictly necessary, standard armor helps to reduce coverage of the parts that are being protected by shieldings and therefore keep the shieldings intact longer. One important note is that the ""basic"" rating 1 versions of the shieldings are not worth the cost of the slot for a paltry 33% damage reduction which makes the parts roughly 50% more durable. On the other hand, Imp. versions at 66% (3x more durable) or Exp. versions at 90% (10x more durable!) make a much more significant contribution to durability.

[[Image]]../part_art/Imp. Propulsion Shielding.png|[[Imp. Propulsion Shielding]], a mid-tier Propulsion Shielding variant[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]]Propulsion Shieldings[[/Heading]]
These shieldings have a lot of value at the extremes of low integrity flight units like [[Biomechanical Wings]] or high coverage flight units like the [[Flying Fortress v7]]. The Flying Fortress will chew through them quite quickly, so consider fabbing or repairing them on a regular basis. On the other hand, a single propulsion shielding can keep a stack of Biomechanical Wings going for ages. Of course, they are still reasonable for any kind of middle ground scenario as well.

[[Image]]../part_art/Imp. Utility Shielding.png|[[Imp. Utility Shielding]], a mid-tier Utility Shielding variant[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]]Utility Shieldings[[/Heading]]
These shieldings are the most useful of the bunch. Flight has a tendency to load up on powerful but fragile utilities of all kinds. Everybody knows the pain of having a 1/500 utility being sniped off, but these shieldings, especially [[Exp. Utility Shielding]], take that risk away. It's still worth swapping high coverage utilities like sensors off during combat in order to reduce the amount of damage the shieldings need to take.

[[Image]]../part_art/Med. Storage Unit.png|Med. Storage Unit, a mid-tier storage unit that fits on most midgame flight builds[[/Image]]
[[Heading]][[Storage Unit|Storage Units]][[/Heading]]
Inventory is an essential part of any build, but it may be surprising to learn that flight doesn't need any dedicated storage units at all! A well-off flight build can avoid trouble and go without burning through backups. The builtin 5 storage is enough to carry a few essential backups and some utility swaps. Over the course of the run, upgrading to a reasonably sized storage unit becomes easier thanks to increasing flight unit support and number of total slots.

[[Table]]
Storage Unit|Analysis||
[[CellStyle:Neutral]]
[[Sml. Storage Unit]]|5 mass can be easily fit in early [[Factory]]. However, the low inventory increase and mass make it a low value pick. Trading 1 active utility slot gives +3 inventory slots to a total of 8, but practically speaking, it's only really +2 slots because a more useful part could have been used instead of the storage unit.||
[[CellStyle:Good]][[Med. Storage Unit]]|
10 mass can be reasonably fit in early-mid Factory. 10 is a good-sized inventory that can fit both essential backups and potentially useful/greed items for later. Can stay on Medium Storage throughout the run or upgrade later.||
[[CellStyle:Good]][[Lrg. Storage Unit]]|20 mass is a little more difficult to fit until [[Research]] depths. 15 inventory gives a ton of room for hauling all sorts of goodies. [[Mass Support Devices]] can help achieve the required level of mass support.||
[[CellStyle:Neutral]][[Hcp. Storage Unit]]|40 mass is not a reasonably-obtainable amount of free mass support for most flight builds. Hcp. Storage Units requires an excessive number of flight units or a powerful prototype Mass Support Device like the [[Quantum Shading Machine]]. 20 inventory is far more than most builds need, but can be useful when preparing for an extended [[Wintypes|Wintype]].||
[[CellStyle:Good]][[Lightpack 2.0]]|
A very funny storage unit due to its side effect of eating parts, but fairly well suited for a flight build. Make sure to take plenty of extra backups with this storage unit, since there's a good chance they might all be needed.||
[[CellStyle:Bad]][[Humpback]]|Good luck!
[[/Table]]

[[Heading]][[Trap Extractors]][[/Heading]]
Trap Extractors are a bit niche but can be quite valuable in certain extended [[Wintypes]]. There is also no shortage of random troublesome squads to use traps against. Flight's speed makes it easy to plant traps without being spotted or lure hostiles into already placed traps near explosive machines.","","","","","","",""
"Strategy/aoemica's Flight Guide/Good Weapons","Other","Even though flight builds can get away from most encounters without resorting to combat, it doesn't mean that weapons aren't important. Eliminating fast moving hostiles like [[Cutter|Cutters]], [[Swarmer|Swarmers]], or [[Programmer|Programmers]] might be a better option than trying to escape and getting backed into a corner. Additionally, it's often worth just clearing out an annoyingly positioned squad guarding a bottleneck in the map instead of running by and getting chased and shot a bunch of times. Some flight builds even specialize in combat exclusively instead of trying to stay stealthy.

[[Heading]][[Ballistic Weapons]][[/Heading]]
The longer-ranged and lower upkeep requirements of kinetic weaponry tend to be a good partner with flight. Guns, and especially cannons, can be used for kiting bots at maximum range with a [[Visual Processing Units|Visual Processing Unit]].

[[Heading:2]][[Ballistic Guns]][[/Heading]]
Two advantages of guns are that they are lighter than cannons and don't have high recoil, at least generally speaking. ""Gunstack"" flight uses 4 or more kinetic guns, trading the tankiness of slower propulsion for unparalleled speed and repositioning capabilities of flight. Flight can also make good use of their penetration capabilities to kill hostiles through walls. A stack of guns can serve as the coverage for the build rather than using dedicated armor. However, in small numbers, kinetic guns are inefficient at any serious combat.

[[Image]]../part_art/Hyp. Coil Gun.png|[[Hyp. Coil Gun]], a mid-tier hypervelocity gun[[/Image]]
[[Heading:3]][[Hyp. Weapons]]|Hyp. Weapons (Guns)[[/Heading]]
Hypervelocity guns have very low damage, but make up for it in their low recoil, high range, critical destroy chance, and penetration.

[[Heading:3]]Recoil[[/Heading]]
Some guns, like the [[Shotgun|Shotguns]], have abnormally high recoil that can really ruin Cogmind's aim. While this can be offset by a few means, it is  good idea to double check this stat before using a weapon. [[Recoil Stabilizers]] are a niche utility that can occasionally be beneficial for flight gunstack builds to deal with that recoil. Typically, [[Targeting Computers]] are superior as they not only cancel recoil but can provide better targeting even after cancelling the recoil. There is a break-even point with enough guns and/or enough high-recoil guns where a Recoil Stabilizer is better. Make sure to do the math to determine which one is the better choice.

[[Heading:2]][[Ballistic Cannons]][[/Heading]]
Cannons are much heavier, have higher recoil, and have higher upkeep requirements than guns. While at first this may make cannons appear to be a bad choice for flight, their great range of 22 makes them perfect for kiting nearly all bot types. Stacking cannons is not easy, but flight can make great use out of a single 2 slot cannon like a [[Hvy. Mass Driver]] and a [[Weapon Cyclers|Weapon Cycler]].

[[Heading:3]][[Hyp. Weapons]]|Hyp. Weapons (Cannons)[[/Heading]]
Hyp. Cannons like the [[Hyp. Gauss Cannon]] are very powerful due to their high critical hit chance taking out bots or their parts from full integrity. Destroying the propulsion of bots makes them even easier to kite.

[[Image]]../part_art/Tri-rail Accelerator.png|Tri-rail Accelerator[[/Image]]
[[Heading:3]][[Tri-rail Accelerator]][[/Heading]]
The Tri-Rail Accelerator is notable for having relatively low mass for a 2 slot cannon, but still offering superb damage. This weapon is a very high value a schematic hack target, and it is worth fabbing these throughout the run.

[[Heading]][[Electromagnetic Weapons]][[/Heading]]
Electromagnetic Weapons are mediocre for flight builds because it is very difficult to support the kind of energy required for long term use. It is possible to store energy in [[Energy Wells]] to temporarily get enough energy for more volleys, but this is not reliable in the long term. EM is also a poor choice against [[Programmer|Programmers]], which is one of flight's biggest annoyances. That's not to say that EM should be written off entirely, but it is a lot more specialized in use compared to combat builds. Unfortunately, the bots that EM is best against are those that are most easily avoided by flight.
One notable advantage of EM weaponry for flight builds is memory loss effect of [[Corruption]]. A bot with 10% corruption will lose tracking on Cogmind twice as fast, with higher corruption percentage working even more effectively. This is a niche use case, but tagging a bot with EM and then running can sometimes work out.

[[Heading:2]][[Energy Filters]][[/Heading]]
Energy Filters can make EM weaponry a lot more manageable to support. As this part is fragile, consider using [[Utility Shieldings]].

[[Image]]../part_art/Com. Tesla Bomb Launcher.png|Com. Tesla Bomb Launcher[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]][[Electromagnetic Launchers]][[/Heading]]
While more energy-intensive than guns or cannons, EM launchers allow Cogmind to hit multiple bots at once, even behind walls if aimed well. Some standout weapons are the [[Gui. EMP Blaster]], which is expensive but allows very safe kiting with waypoints, and the [[Hvy. Proton Missile Launcher]] and [[Com. Tesla Bomb Launcher]] for their high range and explosive radius.

[[Heading:2]][[Lrn. Proton Cannon]]/[[EMDS]][[/Heading]]
The 22 range on these weapons makes them particularly good for kiting bots. [[Spoiler]]The EMDS is especially powerful, heavy, and fragile. For all those downsides, it also gets penetration so it can be used to snipe bots safely through walls.[[/Spoiler]]

[[Heading]][[Thermal Weapons]][[/Heading]]
Thermal weaponry falls under a similar camp as EM weapons. The energy costs are not as expensive, but the heat dissipation is always an issue and will require multiple slots worth of cooling when running a decent amount.
With enough thermal guns, it is possible to perform an alpha strike and trigger meltdown in one or two volleys, then run away to dissipate heat. However, this requires a lot of specific meltdown-enabling guns like [[Gatling Laser|Gatling Lasers]] or [[Plasma Rifle|Plasma Rifles]], and is significantly more fragile than a kinetic gunstack build.

[[Image]]../part_art/Hvy. Plasma Cannon.png|[[Hvy. Plasma Cannon]], a good digging cannon[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]][[Thermal Cannons]][[/Heading]]
A full set of Thermal Cannons are unrealistic for flight combat for their many downsides of mass, energy cost, and heat generation. However, Thermal Cannons can be used as a [[Digging]] tool that allows safe digging up up to 3  tiles. This only works well with rating 5 or higher cannons, as lower rating cannons either can't dig or can only inconsistently dig through walls.

[[Heading]][[Explosive Launchers]][[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Safe Explosive Digging.png|Structural Scanner revealing safe dug-out tiles[[/Image]]
Launchers are one of flight's greatest offensive tools. Unlike slower builds, flight can use launchers without worrying too much about collateral damage and [[Alert]] thanks to its ability to run away from dangerous situations. Still, it is better to avoid careless uses of launchers that leads to cascading [[U-05 Engineer|Engineer]] [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcements]] and [[Assault Squad|Assaults]]. Launchers are by far the best way to take out an annoying squad of [[Swarmer|Swarmers]] or [[Cutter|Cutters]].
One combo worth mentioning for flight is combining launchers with a [[Structural Scanner]]. Digging with explosives is dangerous because it destabilizes tiles and triggers [[Cave-ins]]. However, the Structural Scanner can reveal destabilized tiles with the brighter red color as shown on the right. Digging this way is more inventory efficient than keeping a dedicated digging cannon if you are already carrying both of these around.
Any type of launchers will work well for Flight, but there are a few standout choices:

[[Heading:2]][[Mni. Grenade Launcher]][[/Heading]]
A good early-game Launcher with a minimal mass of 1. Early flight builds are often strapped for mass and inventory space. This allows you to keep your lightweight Launcher attached in an unused weapon slot to save an inventory swap slot. Just watch out for misfires if Cogmind has any corruption.

[[Image]]../part_art/Rocket Array.png|Rocket Array[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]][[Rocket Array|Regular]] and [[Scatter Rocket Array]][[/Heading]]
Rocket Arrays have a far above average damage output, even for launchers. Their biggest downsides are their arc, delay, and matter costs. However, flight can easily reposition to use these and support the matter costs by killing NC bots. Make sure your targets are around max range so the majority of the projectiles explode into the target. Trying to shoot nearby enemies usually just results most in rockets sailing past the target and leaving them unharmed.

[[Heading:2]][[Lrn. Missile Launcher]][[/Heading]]
The 20 range on this launcher makes it great for sniping and kiting most types of patrols.

[[Image]]../part_art/Mni. Smartbomb Launcher.png|Mni. Smartbomb Launcher[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]][[Mni. Smartbomb Launcher]][[/Heading]]
This Launcher is the king of flight launchers with its low mass and waypoints, which are an ideal combination for flight kiting. The Mni. Smartbomb Launcher can take out squads from around corner with ease. The tradeoff for this is the high matter cost and relatively low damage output. Be careful about nuking your own cover by hitting a bot you didn't expect to be there when shooting blindly around a corner.
One thing to keep in mind about guided launchers is that standard [[Sensor Arrays]] don't update instantly, but instead once per turn. This means that hostiles may not always be in the location that the sensor indicates. Realtime sensors like [[FarCom]] and the [[Seismic Detector]] do report the bot location at all times, which makes them more useful when using these weapons.

[[Heading:2]][[Gui. Micro-nuke Launcher]][[/Heading]]
A grown up 2-slot version of the Mni. Smartbomb Launcher. This weapon is a bit harder to use safely due to its larger explosive radius, but it does have 20 range to make up for it. Works best with long ranged sensors like the [[Exp. Sensor Array]].

[[Heading]][[Melee Weapons]][[/Heading]]
Melee weapons are one of the most natural pairings for flight. Melee light, offers good damage with minimal resource costs, and works great with high speeds allowing for easy repositioning and [[Sneak Attack|Sneak Attacks]]. Melee boosting utilities tend to be light or are already beneficial for flight like [[Reaction Control Systems]]. Melee works best at 1v1 combat but is not so good against large groups of enemies, so launchers serve as a good secondary weapon type. All 3 types of melee are effective, although Impact is a little more niche compared to the other two.

[[Image]]../part_art/Powered Hammer.png|[[Powered Hammer]], a mid-tier impact weapon[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]][[Impact Weapons]][[/Heading]]
Impact weapons are the most powerful melee weapons in terms of raw damage but tend to be unreliable against bots that aren't weak to EM like [[Sentry|Sentries]] and [[Programmer|Programmers]]. In fact, their poor performance against Programmers, one of the biggest nuisances of flight, is one of the biggest downsides of impact. The upside is that they can very easily kill EM-weak green non-combat bots, [[Grunt|Grunts]], and [[Hunter|Hunters]] through their part-crushing corruption effect.
One especially good use for impact is killing [[Hauler|Haulers]]. There is a high chance to kill Haulers in a single sneak attack which will avoid the call for reinforcements. This technique can work very effectively even on guarded Haulers. Either whack the Hauler from around the corner once or lure the guard Grunts out of the way to get a few uninterrupted swings.

[[Redacted]]
[[Heading:3]][[Cep. Blasthammer]][[/Heading]]
As the only AOE-type melee weapon, this [[Protoforge]]-exclusive part is uniquely powerful at clearing out lategame squads. Make sure to maneuver around in combat to maximize the AOE attacks into as many bots as possible.
[[/Redacted]]

[[Spoiler]]
[[Heading:3]][[Core Stripper]][[/Heading]]
The Core Stripper is a fairly niche flight melee weapon. It is absurdly expensive to wield, but has a 1/3 chance of killing a lot of scary endgame bots in a single hit. [[Redacted]]This is worth consideration for fighting [[A Bots]] and the [[M Guard|M Guards]] and [[Combat Programmer|Combat Programmers]] of the [[Command#Doom Corridor|Doom Corridor]].[[/Redacted]] Very few normal bots are worth using this on, as even something scary like a [[B-99 Colossus]] can easily be run away from on flight.[[/Spoiler]]

[[Image]]../part_art/Spear.png|[[Spear]], a mid-tier piercing weapon[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]][[Piercing Weapons]][[/Heading]]
Piercing weapons are at their height of their power at the hands of a flight build. They tend to be less efficient at killing bots than slashing weapons for other propulsion types due to their low base damage, but flight can really make them shine with their doubled momentum boost capping out at an impressive 80% bonus damage. This is achievable for a flight build hitting 8 speed, with a single [[Reaction Control System]] preventing the need to move in between attacks to obtain momentum. While this is no easy feat, it is possible for an endgame flight build to reach this level of speed with some overloading.
Throughout most of the run, piercing weapons tend to be slightly less effective than equally rated slashing weapons. The reduced damage often means that what will kill in one hit from a slashing weapon will take 2 hits with a piercing weapon. The 8% core analysis bonus is helpful, but it is still significantly worse to take an additional hit on core to kill. In general, they are roughly at or slightly below equivalently-rated slashing weapons in effectiveness, but creep ahead with a fully kitted out endgame melee build.

[[Spoiler]]
[[Heading:3]][[CR-A16's Pointy Stick]][[/Heading]]
The Pointy Stick can be difficult to transform into the [[CR-A16's Behemoth Slayer|Behemoth Slayer]], but is very valuable if obtained. Being able to eliminate a Behemoth guarding a [[Fabricator]] or stockpile of good parts is always useful. To activate it, consider using allies to take aggro for you and/or temporarily swapping onto [[Treads]] and slapping on heavy armor to avoid losing a bunch of valuable flight units.
[[/Spoiler]]

[[Image]]../part_art/Plasma Lance.png|Plasma Lance[[/Image]]
[[Heading:3]][[Plasma Lance]][[/Heading]]
This weapon is the strongest standard 0b10 piercing weapon. Plasma Lances are fabbable relatively early as a 7* part, and are also obtainable from [[Striker|Strikers]] in many [[Derelict]]-related events.

[[Spoiler]]
[[Heading:3]][[Vortex Lance]][[/Heading]]
Vortex Lances, only obtainable in [[Warlord (Location)#Warlord's Stash]] are the strongest piercing weapons in the game. They deal Entropic damage rather than Piercing damage, which is entirely unresisted by all bot types. They also have extremely high damage for a a melee weapon and 0 delay, leading to unparalleled melee damage per turn. Save these for important endgame targets as they have limited uses.
[[/Spoiler]]

[[Redacted]]
[[Heading:3]][[Exp. Jetlance]][[/Heading]]
Exp. Jetlance is a [[Protoforge]]-exclusive weapon that is also the strongest conventional piercing weapon. While the damage is significantly less impressive than the Vortex Lance, this weapon has unlimited uses, 0 delay, and an impressively high 50% Impale critical rate. Even though the damage effect is not overly significant combined with 50% actuating power from something like [[Femtoactuators]], the impale effect can end up reducing the damage taken by Cogmind thanks to the effect delaying the hit bot as well. Just make sure not to fight in the open with many surrounding bots, as impale crits may work against you.
[[/Redacted]]

[[Heading:2]][[Slashing Weapons]][[/Heading]]
Slashing weapons are the go-to melee weapon for all build types, and for good reason. They have moderately high damage, are better than pierce without an optimized endgame melee build, and are more reliable than impact against many bot types. Slashing isn't particularly exciting damage type, but is the best choice for the job in most cases.

[[Image]]../part_art/Greatsword.png|Greatsword[[/Image]]
[[Heading:3]][[Greatsword]][[/Heading]]
The Greatsword is a good early game flight weapon that doubles as armor at a reasonable mass. Its high damage also can destroy many early [[Factory]] bots with a single attack. Just watch its integrity, since its high coverage means it tends not to last long in combat.

[[Spoiler]]
[[Heading:3]][[Companion Sword]][[/Heading]]
A fantastic weapon found in [[Scraptown]] that scales all the way into extended endgame combat. It does have a few negative side effects like random teleportation and core loss, but flight is well suited to deal with these costs, and can benefit from its many other special abilities. Notably, the free sensors can save 2 active utility slots, shadow attacks provide fantastic free bonus damage, sever can sever even bots that are immune to the normal effect, and sunder can annihilate tough enemies from full core integrity. See [[Quantum Companion]] for more details.
[[/Spoiler]]

[[Image]]../part_art/Longsword +1.png|Longsword +1[[/Image]]
[[Heading:3]][[Longsword +1]][[/Heading]]
This unique [[Exiles (Location)|Exiles]] weapon is a great weapon through the run with high early-game damage, builtin targeting, and no attack delay. While it is not especially fragile, it does tend to get worn down over the duration of a run. It may be worth using [[Weapon Shieldings]] on this part early in the run if you want this part to last.

[[Spoiler]]
[[Heading:3]][[1C-UTU's Sword ""Lootmaker""|1C-UTU's Swords ""Lootmaker""]] and [[1C-UTU's Sword ""Choppy""|""Choppy""]][[/Heading]]
2 rare swords only obtainable from the [[Z-Hero]] [[1C-UTU]]. ""Choppy"" is an above-average but fairly typical slashing weapon. However, ""Lootmaker"" has a positive salvage stat, the only instance of this stat on a melee weapon. The most common way that a flight build will see these items is by attacking the [[Exiles (Location)|Exiles]] or by [[Imprint#Roster Hacks|Imprint Roster Hacks]] summoning 1C-UTU. However, both methods are fairly unlikely to result in this outcome specifically.
[[/Spoiler]]

[[Image]]../part_art/Nanosword.png|Nanosword[[/Image]]
[[Heading:3]][[Nanosword]][[/Heading]]
Nanoswords are the strongest standard 0b10 slashing weapon. They have very low mass and coverage which makes them easy to support in large numbers (4 or more), which makes them pair well with [[Actuator Arrays]]. As an 8* part, they are fabbable fairly late into the run, but are at least repairable.

[[Redacted]]
[[Heading:3]][[Cep. Deflector Sword]][[/Heading]]
The Deflector Sword is a [[Protoforge]]-exclusive upgrade to the Nanosword. It has higher integrity and damage as well as a unique 15% deflection ability. The deflection ability occasionally comes in handy, although many scary endgame bots are immune to the effect. Still, any deflects are useful, and this is the best guaranteed slashing weapon in the game.
[[/Redacted]]

[[Spoiler]][[Heading:3]][[Sigix Broadsword]][[/Heading]]
The Sigix Broadsword is arguably the best flight melee weapon in the game. However, it is not its fighting capabilities that are useful, but rather its ability to serve as armor. 800 coverage is a massive amount for a flight build, often 50% of the coverage for the whole build, or even more. 10 mass for such good protection is a steal. Its 300 integrity is very low compared to its coverage value, and it has a habit of being worn down by lots of enemies or crit off by [[Hunter|Hunters]] at inconvenient times. It is often better to detach and carry this part in inventory when running low on integrity instead of risking letting it be destroyed entirely, although [[Corruption]] fuses can ruin this technique. Baby this part when you need to and the broadsword will prove a solid piece of armor for the rest of the run.

"Subcaves","Location","Subcaves is an early game [[Branch]] that is guaranteed to appear on -10 every run, with exits being available from [[Materials]] and [[Mines]]. It is a dangerous map, containing a large number of [[Subdweller|Subdwellers]] that will attack Cogmind on sight. A few [[0b10]] patrols may roam the map, engaging wild [[Derelict|Derelicts]].
Unlike most maps, some areas may not be totally accessible in Subcaves without digging. Machinery strewn throughout the map can block passage to important areas. [[Artisan|Artisans]] will grow the machinery even more. Another unique bot presenter, [[Cobbler|Cobblers]], scoop up matter and produce random parts with their [[Cobbler Unit]].
It is easy to be overwhelmed by Subdwellers due to the overall low quality of parts available and relatively low core available on -10. Using Subdweller's weapons against them is recommended due to their high damage output. A [[Scrap Shield]] should always be used if it drops, since it will protect Cogmind's core and other parts well, and is easily repairable in the Subcaves.

[[Heading]]Unique Mechanics[[/Heading]]
One unique mechanic in this map is the ability to uncover new Subdwellers by digging. Be wary of summoning additional foes in this manner when trying to use [[Launchers]]. Any means of destroying terrain can trigger this effect.
Leaving partially damaged parts on the ground will cause ""Subatomizers"" to show up. They are invisible, and will gradually destroy any damaged parts left on the ground for too long.

Superfortress will assemble any destroyed non-weapon parts periodically. One destroyed part will be assembled roughly every 10 turns, although this number is variable. Weapons are instead periodically broken down and assembled instantly. As long as Superfortress has a least one weapon remaining, there will be no prioritization of reassembling weapons. However, if Superfortress runs out of weapons entirely, it will immediately reassemble a full set of weapons.
[[Heading:2]]Weapon Reassembling[[/Heading]]
Superfortress initially has no weapons attached. Upon waking up, it will assemble a random selection of weapons. Superfortress will assemble 4 weapon slots worth of weapons each time it assembles weapons.
Typical weapons are from the following list:
[[Table]]
Part|Slots||
[[Cep. Heavy Railcannon]]|2||
[[Cep. Helical Railcannon]]|1||
[[Cep. Miniperforator]]|1||[[Cep. Plasma Driver]]|1||
[[Cld. Nova Cannon]]|1||
[[Enh. Hardcell Cannon]]|1||
[[Graviton Cannon]]|1||
[[Hvy. Hardcell Cannon]]|2||
[[Null Cannon]]|1||
[[Omega Cannon]]|2
[[/Table]]
When there are 10 or more bots in line of sight, Superfortress may assemble a [[Launchers|Launcher]] instead of one of its typical weapons. The available launchers are from the following list:
[[List]]
[[Cep. Arcsight Missile Launcher]]|
[[Com. Tesla Bomb Launcher]]|
[[Enh. Gamma Bomb Array]]|
[[Fusion Bomb Launcher]]|
[[Gamma Bomb Array]]|
[[Gamma Driveblaster]]|
[[Ragnarok Missile Launcher]][[/List]]
[[Heading]]Robot Assembling[[/Heading]]
When Superfortress is under fire or there are multiple  hostiles in line of sight, it will assemble allies to fight for it. The more hostiles are in line of sight, the more likely it is that Superfortress will assemble a new ally each turn. This can make it very difficult to maintain a numbers advantage over Superfortress. Bots assembled can be from the following list:
[[List]]
[[Decapitator]]|
[[Executioner]]|
[[H-88 Terminator]]|
[[Hotshot]]|
[[Immortal]]|
[[P-80 Master]]|
[[Striker]]|

Terminals are typically [[0b10]]-controlled [[Interactive Machine|Interactive Machines]] that [[Cogmind]] can hack for a large variety of benefits. Unlike other interactive machines, non-limited 0b10 Terminals do not list all possible ""authorized"" hacks and instead only show a selection of hacks chosen from a large pool. Hack not listed can still be indirectly hacked through manual hacking, though this will incur a -15% penalty per security level to the base success rate of hacks. Some [[Branch|Branches]] have [[Derelict]]-controlled Terminals. 0b10 Terminals are also sometimes guarded by an [[Operator]], which if alerted will lock down the Terminal and call for a [[Reinforcement Squad]] unless it or the Terminal is disabled/destroyed.

[[Heading]]Hacks[[/Heading]]
[[Hacks]]Terminal[[/Hacks]]

[[Heading:2]]Operator [[Data Core]][[/Heading]]
Moving over a destroyed Operator's Data Core will automatically collect and it extract its dynamic key, which provides a one-time bonus that multiplies to the base success rate of all direct and indirect hacks by 1.5 if their base success rate was positive, or raise the base success rate to 0% if it was negative. The dynamic key can only be used within 40 turns before it expires at its Operator's Terminal.

[[Heading:2]][[Multitool]][[/Heading]]
Using a Multitool on a Terminal's interactive tile removes all direct hacks and causes tracing to begin immediately, but applies a modifier to indirect hacks. This modifier can range from -20% to +50%. Multitool is best used with a lot of [[Defensive Hackware]] to increase the number of hacks that can be safely performed after modification.
[[Heading:2]]Central database authorization[[/Heading]]
Indirect hacks for lore records, prototype IDs, part or robot schematics, and robot analyses, are all considered ""database hacks"". Successfully hacking any of them has a base 25% chance to instead cause a map-wide central database lockout, preventing further indirect database hacks. However, direct hacks of those types remain possible after a central database lockout, and they cannot cause one in the first place. The first indirect database hack on a map cannot cause a database lockout.
Not all lore records, parts schematic, robot analyses or robot schematics can be indirectly hacked on all Terminals. Terminals have a level of database authorization dependent on security level and current depth, equal to (10 - current depth + security level). It is only possible to indirectly hack a part/robot schematic or analysis if the Terminal's authorization level is equal to or higher than the rating/tier of the relevant part/robot (prototype parts are considered to have a +1 to their rating for this purpose).
For example, at -5/Factory, level 2 Terminals have an authorization level of (10 - 5 + 2) = 7, which would allow hacking for standard rating 7 parts or prototype rating 6 parts.
Lore records also have a hidden rating/tier stat. This value can only be determined by attempting and failing to access a particular record.

[[Heading:2]]Additional Details/Usage Tips[[/Heading]]
[[Heading:3]]Grayed Out Direct Hacks[[/Heading]]
[[GameText]][Local Emergency Access][[/GameText]], [[GameText]][Purge Alert][[/GameText]] and all [[GameText]][Traps][[/GameText]] hacks appear greyed out in direct hacks if they are currently useless. In other words, if a Terminal has a greyed out direct [[GameText]][Locate Traps][[/GameText]] hack, then there are no [[Traps]] within the Terminal's range.
[[Heading:3]]Grouped Direct Hacks[[/Heading]]
If either [[GameText]][Disarm Traps][[/GameText]] or [[GameText]][Reprogram Traps][[/GameText]] is available as a direct hack, then [[GameText]][Locate Traps][[/GameText]] will also be a direct hack on that Terminal. If [[GameText]][Purge Alert][[/GameText]] is available as a direct hack, then [[GameText]][Check Alert][[/GameText]] will also be a direct hack on that Terminal. If there is a direct [[GameText]][Recall][[/GameText]] hack available, then the corresponding [[GameText]][Status][[/GameText]] hack will also be available on that Terminal.
[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Access(Branch)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]
Certain branch entrances are not revealed by this hack because they are either unknown to 0b10 or considered more secret/secure. The full list of these branches is: [[Lab]], [[Protoforge]], [[Section 7]], [[Scraptown]] and [[Subcaves]].
[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Access(Emergency)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]
This hack reveals emergency accesses within a radius of 20 tiles of the Terminal. Within a Garrison, this reveals all emergency accesses as well as phase walls throughout the entire map.
[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Alert(Check)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]
[[Alert]] is reported in the alphabet form rather than as the exact precise number. For example, the Terminal reports alert level 1-A at 200 influence.
[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Alert(Purge)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]
The base success rate of this hack goes down by 10% after each successful hack. This reduction only applies for the current map.
[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Enumerate()[[/GameText]] Hacks[[/Heading]]
Enumerate hacks reveal the current position of all bots of the matching type across the map. These positions can be enabled/disabled in the intel console window. These positions will not update in realtime. If the hack is performed again, all existing intel positions of the same type will be cleared before being added again, so the intel does not stack.
[[Spoiler]][[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Force(Sabotage)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]
Adds an additional 50 alert if the hack succeeds but is unsuccessful in sabotaging a machine. Adds 100 alert if the hack succeeds and sabotages a machine. Additional alert from the explosive machine does not get added like when Cogmind shoots a machine to blow it up. This can reduce alert gained in maps with huge explosive machines such as [[Hub_04(d)]]. In fact, Hub is the best place to use this hack, as blowing up a random machine is seldom useful in most other maps, and the only valid targets within the map are the Network Hubs themselves.[[/Spoiler]]

[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Layout(zone)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]
Reveals the map in a 31x31 area around the map. That is, 15 tiles in each cardinal direction from the center tile of the Terminal[[Comment]]Since it's a 31x31 area, should it be 16 tiles ""from the center tile of the terminal"" or 15? It depends on whether we count the terminal tile or not.[[/Comment]]. Note that this hack cannot reveal a part of the map if it is not structurally connected (at least not within the 31x31 area) to the Terminal. Earth tiles are the only thing that can cause such a disconnect. For example, in a scenario with two rooms with only one layer of Earth tiles between them, and the shortest then a Terminal within one of the two rooms would only be able to reveal the other room if there was some structural connection from the Terminal to that room within 15 tiles from the Terminal. Otherwise, the room would not be mapped by the hack despite being very close to the Terminal. Potentially shorter structural connections can be created via terrain destruction.

[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Inventory()[[/GameText]] Hacks[[/Heading]]
All stockpiles matching the hack type on the floor are revealed. This is all groups of items within a 2x2-3x3 area, even if not all tiles in the square are filled out. Occasionally, a stockpile named after one item only actually has one of that item and has other different parts. This data can be enabled/disabled in the intel console window.
[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Prototypes[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]
The number of prototype IDs received is 2 on a security level 1 terminal, 3 on a level 2, and 4 on a level 3. Duplicate prototype IDs cannot be received from a single hack. This hack never starts greyed out as a direct hack, even if no new prototype IDs are available.
[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Recall()[[/GameText]] Hacks[[/Heading]]
The base success rate of these hacks go down by 10% after each successful hack, even if there were no squads of the corresponding type to recall. This only applies to hacks of the same type, not all Recall hacks. This reduction only applies for the current map.

[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Traps()[[/GameText]] Hacks[[/Heading]]
The range at which Traps may be located, disarmed or reprogrammed is based on ""move distance"" from the Terminal rather than ""direct distance"". If moving to a Trap array from the Terminal's position would require too many moves, then that Trap array isn't in the Terminal's range. Creating new paths by destroying terrain can increase the range of a Terminal's Traps hacks.

[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Schematic()[[/GameText]] Hacks[[/Heading]]
Direct schematic hacks may contain parts/bots with a rating/tier up to 3 higher than that of the base floor. For example, in -6 Factory, standard floor parts may be rating 5, but schematics up to rating 8 may be offered.[[Comment]]I've seen a Hvy. Dispersion Rifle direct schematic hack in -5/Factory and a Cld. Q-thruster in -4/Factory, which confirms the ""3 ratings higher than that of the base floor"" but i haven't noticed the ""3 rating higher"" with non-prototype parts, so i'm not sure if you could find a non-prototype rating 8 part or a tier 8 bot hack on a terminal in -6/Factory. I'd assume so, but i'd prefer to find proof.[[/Comment]]
When entering a map, if you already have a schematic that's supposed to appear on a Terminal, that schematic hack may be re-rolled.[[Sup]][[Terminal#references|[1]]][[/Sup]]

There are few patrols, no [[Sentry]] or [[Heavy]] guards, and only a few special mini guard areas that can usually be easily avoided. There are unique [[Researcher]] bots that show up on this map that have dangerous effects when getting scanned. There are also powerful special and unique items that are not obtainable anywhere else. Even among normal parts, there is a much higher than usual chance of finding [[Prototype Part|Prototype Parts]] on the ground. Like all Research branches, [[FarCom]] will trigger [[Maximum Security]] upon entry.
Testing is home to the [[SGEMP Prototype]] that [[Zhirov]] asks for when you see him in his [[Zhirov (Location)|lab]]. It is guarded by 2 [[Striker|Strikers]] and an [[Alpha 7]]. The SGEMP always spawns in the vertically opposite corner of the map that Cogmind first spawns on. For example, if Cogmind would spawn in the top-left section of the map, the SGEMP would be in the bottom left. With the [[Phasing AFG]] and [[Portable AFG]], it is possible to retrieve the SGEMP without getting spotted at all. Otherwise the primary methods of obtaining are fighting the bots head-on or grabbing it and making a run for it.

[[Heading:2]][[Protovariant|Protovariants]][[/Heading]]
There can be up to 2 Protovariants on a Testing map. These are prototype superpowered versions of different bot classes that have a very strong loadout of high rating prototype parts. They are fearsome foes with high damage output and are quite difficult to take down compared to most bots but have incredible loot. They can spawn in one of 4 states: Unpowered, Dormant, Active, or Disabled/rewirable. Protovariants can be of the following types:
[[List]][[Protovariant D]]: Demolisher|[[Protovariant G]]: Grunt|[[Protovariant H]]: Hunter|[[Protovariant L]] Duelist|[[Protovariant P]]: Programmer|[[Protovariant X]]: Specialist|[[Protovariant Y]]: Sentry[[/List]]
In Testing there is a special hack that can appear on [[Terminal|Terminals]]: [[GameText]]Control(Protovariants)[[/GameText]]. If successfully performed, it will turn a Protovariant on the map hostile to everything. The Protovariant can make quite a mess of 0b10 bots, but may cause more trouble than it's worth. Researchers will report the bot repeatedly when they see it attack. There is a special assault [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] that gets dispatched to the Protovariant's location when this hack is performed. This ARC contains an [[Investigator]] inside that will scan Cogmind even without being provoked. Sometimes a Protovariant will enter the out of control state even if Cogmind does not perform the [[GameText]]Control(Protovariants)[[/GameText]] hack.
[[Heading:2]]Testing Shells[[/Heading]]
The majority of unique Testing items appear in Reinforced Shells. There are no identifying features that indicate the contents of these Shells. The list of unique Testing items contained within are:
[[List]][[2N-1CE's Frost Array]]|[[AEGIS Remote Shield]]|[[Cld. Nova Cannon]]|[[Disintegrator]]|[[Exp. Hardlight Generator]]|[[Ghost Barrier]]|[[Hpw. Disruptor Cannon]]|[[Hvy. Quantum Rifle]]|[[Hyp.

Multirail]]|[[Myomer Exoskeleton]]|[[Null Cannon]]|[[Omega Cannon]]|[[Perforator]]|[[Portable AFG]]|[[System Mapper]]|[[Tachyon Dispersion Ray]]|[[Warp Gun]]|[[Z-bomb Delivery System]][[/List]]
There are 2 unique prefabs that do not contain any of the above items and have their own list. One prefab has 1-2 [[Potential Cannon|Potential Cannons]] or [[Imp. Potential Cannon|Imp. Potential Cannons]] (not necessarily the same type) and several [[Imp. Energy Well|Imp]], [[Adv. Energy Well|Adv.]], or [[Exp. Energy Well|Exp. Energy Wells]]. The other shell is locked behind Sealed Heavy Doors and has a special Researcher behind. The Terminal can be hacked to open the doors, but the Researcher will make it difficult to break the Shell without getting scanned. However, penetrating the heavy doors first will allow safely killing the Researcher. It is also possible to dig in to the back of the prefab directly into the Shell area. The shell will always contain [[SHELL Armor]] and 3 random pieces of [[Lgt. Regenerative Plating]], [[Med. Regenerative Plating]], or [[Hvy. Regenerative Plating]]. The Terminal on the inside of the shell contains schematic for some of the regenerative platings.
[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There is always 1, and possibly 3 exits in Testing:
[[List]]Main access exit: There will always be 1 exit that leads to the next main Research or [[Access]] floor. It will always be at a dead end at a tile corridor near the top-middle or bottom-middle of the map.|[[Redacted]]Section 7 and Protoforge exits: These exit only appears some of the time. [[Quarantine]] must have been first on the world map, so these exits can only show up when Testing is on -2. A large 4 tile doorway will show up on the middle of the map, on the right side of where the map typically ends. It will open up into a 6 tile hallway and a [[Fortress]] will be guarding the path to the exits. These exits will be closed if Cogmind is FarCom aligned.[[/Redacted]][[/List]]","Spoiler","","","","","",""

"Thief","Bot","Thieves will sometimes appear in [[Caves]] maps, usually either waiting in ambush or suddenly appearing from outside Cogmind's field of view.


[[Heading:2]]Behavior[[/Heading]]
Thieves dash towards the closest visible enemy robot and try to steal one of that robot's parts using their [[Tearclaws]]. If successful, the Thief will flee, carrying the stolen part in their inventory. If a Thief in the process of fleeing is or goes outside Cogmind's field of view, they will exit the map.

When trying to steal parts, Thieves might ignore unarmed robots and instead target Cogmind or combat robots.

[[Heading:2]]Strategies[[/Heading]]
Thieves are incapable of taking parts on the ground, so dropping important parts you don't want to lose keeps them safe from them. However, this strategy can backfire if there are [[Dirty Bomb Trap|Dirty Bomb Traps]] or [[Decomposer|Decomposer]] nearby, or if Cogmind or other robots carry  [[Launchers]] or [[Electromagnetic Weapons]] capable of triggering chain reactions in power sources.

Moving behind combat allies or swapping with them to place them closer to the Thieves can prevent your own parts getting stolen, at the cost of your allies'.

In order to actually destroy Thieves, Launchers can work well when aimed at walls next to the Thieves, though at close range the collateral damage might not be worth it. Targeting utilities can help actually hit them while they are approaching, and a Stasis Beam/Projector can prevent a single Thief from attacking or escaping while also making them easier to hit, at the cost of making them take 50% less damage.

[[Blade Trap|Blade Traps]], [[Segregator Trap|Segregator Traps]] and [[Stasis Trap|Stasis Traps]] can work well in disarming or stopping Thieves, provided you have enough time to place them, for example before attacking a Thief ambush.

If Cogmind is fast enough, fleeing is also an option, for example to lead the Thieves into 0b10 robots, [[Warlord]]-aligned derelicts or traps.

Most jammers have short range, so attention needed to keep enemies in range. [[Watcher]] and [[Heavy]] bots require special attention due to their big visual range.
Significantly decreases chances of small confrontation snowballing into big fight.
Limits consequences of mistakes during stealth, if you can deal with bot that spotted you. Gives significantly more freedom to stealth builds able to take on small groups of enemies.
If you can destroy [[Extermination Squad|extermination squad's]] leader without the rest of the squad seeing you, they might wander away.
Jammers allow you to force 1-v-1 fights via [[Line of Sight|LoS]] manipulation. Works best versus stationary bots like [[Caves|caves outposts]].

"Traps","Part Group","Traps are most often found in groups called arrays, and appear in a variety of layouts including rows, blocks or sparser ""minefields"". They are, however, usually triggered individually.


[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]
[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Traps[[/Lore]]

[[Heading]]Arrays[[/Heading]]
Trap arrays vary in size, Trap type, and layout formations. Each Trap array contains 1-6 Traps, and is composed entirely of the same Traps. The type of trap that an arrays will be made of depends on the location. For example, [[EM Surge Trap|EM Surge Traps]] cannot appear in [[Materials]]. Trap arrays appear in several types of formations:
[[List]]Door Trap - A 1-Trap array formation where the only trap is directly adjacent to a Door or an Emergency Access door.
|Rows - Found in corridors, usually perpendicularly to the corridor's direction. The Traps will form one or more rows across the corridor, though some tiles of some of the rows may be skipped. When spotting a single trap in a corridor, it is usually fairly simple to guess the approximate location of other Traps in the array.
|Minefield - Usually found in open areas or inside rooms. The Traps are strewn about chaotically, making their locations very unpredictable.
|Prefab - Some prefabs contain Traps in preset formations or random but unusual formations. This can result in unexpected behavior, such as each of the Traps of a prefab being part of its own separate array.  
|Other - Some Trap formations are uncommon and maybe unique to certain maps, making them difficult to recognize and categorize.[[/List]]

[[Heading]]Triggering[[/Heading]]
Moving over a trap does not always trigger it. The chance is instead determined by the form of [[Propulsion]]:
[[Table]]
Mode|Probability|Probability ([[Stasis Trap|Stasis Traps]])
||
 Overweight | 100% | 100%
||
 [[Treads]] | 100% | 0%
||
 [[Legs]] | 75% | 25%
||
 [[Wheels]] | 50% | 50%
||
 [[Hover Units|Hover]]/Core | 40% | 60%
||
 [[Flight Units|Flight]] | 20% | 80%
[[/Table]]
Stasis Traps are a special case and their chance to trigger for each Propulsion type is the opposite of regular traps (Flight ex: 100 - 20 = 80%).
Note there are also multiple undocumented circumstances under which a trap may be triggered, not simply regular movement. Some other ways to trigger traps include: 
[[List]]When corrupted, it is possible to accidentally trigger allied traps when moving over them, with a [corruption %] chance of triggering.
|Attempting to install a trap at a location that already contains a trap unknown to Cogmind will fail to install the new trap and trigger the old one, regardless of the old trap's faction.
|It is possible to manually trigger known traps at Cogmind's current position, although doing this will attribute any explosions from explosive traps to Cogmind, unlike the methods listed above.
|Failure to reprogram a Trap using a [[Melee Datajacks|Melee Datajack]] can rarely cause it to trigger.
|EM explosions have a chance to trigger any traps they hit. [[Sub]](Note: The writer of this is not sure if an EM explosion attributed to Cogmind would cause explosive traps triggered that way to also be attributed Cogmind)[[/Sub]][[/List]]

Once triggered, the trap at that position is spent and will not trigger again. (Some traps exhibit special behavior in this regard.)


[[Heading]]Detection[[/Heading]]
Cogmind has a 1% chance to detect each trap in view, checked every turn, and each active Trap Scanner and allied [[Drone Bays|Drone]] has a separate chance to detect Traps.
Some other ways to detect traps include:
[[List]]
Successfully hacking [[GameText]][Locate Traps][[/GameText]]/Traps(Locate) at [[Terminal|Terminals]] will reveal all nearby trap arrays.
|In [[Garrison|Garrisons]], hacking Download(Registry) will locate all traps within the Garrison, among other things.
|[[Spoiler]]Using the [[GameText]]locate_traps[[/GameText]] on [[Operator|Operators]] with [[RIF]] in combination with a [[Datajacks|Datajack]] will reveal all trap arrays within a range of 30.[[/Spoiler]]
|Collecting a pre-expiry [[Operator]] [[Data Core]] will reveal the location of nearby trap arrays.
|Nearby allied Operators in range will reveal hidden traps within your field of vision.
|Some [[0b10 Decoder Chips]] are capable of passively detecting traps over time.
|Sources of Derelict intel can provide the location of all traps across an entire map.
|Using the [[GameText]]find_chute[[/GameText]] on a [[K-01 Serf]] with a [[Datajacks|Datajack]] will reveal the closest [[Chute Trap]].[[/List]]


[[Heading]]Removal[[/Heading]]
The simplest way to remove one or more traps is to destroy the section of floor housing them, for example using a [[Launchers|Launcher]]. Arrays of hostile traps can be permanently disarmed one array at a time via terminal hacking or [[Spoiler]][[RIF]]-hacking Operators[[/Spoiler]], and disarming traps on an individual basis is a possible side effect of attempting to hack one with an active melee [[Datajacks|Datajack]]. Successfully hacking [[Alarm Trap|Alarm Traps]] or [[Ambush Trap|Ambush Traps]] using a melee Datajack will always disarm them.


[[Heading]]Reprogramming[[/Heading]]
Traps can be reprogrammed through various means, including:
[[List]]
Successfully hacking [[GameText]][Reprogram Traps][[/GameText]]/Traps(Reprogram) at terminals will reveal and reprogram a nearby trap arrays within range.
|[[Spoiler]]Using the [[GameText]]reprogram_traps[[/GameText]] on Operators with a Datajack in combination with RIF will reveal and reprogram the nearest trap array within a range of 30.[[/Spoiler]]
|Attempting to moving into a known hostile trap with an active melee Datajack will instead make Cogmind attempt to hack it, with a base 10% to successfully do so, increased by [[Offensive Hackware]]. Successfully hacking a Trap will usually reprogram it, though this may sometimes disarm it. Successfully hacking [[Alarm Trap|Alarm Traps]] or [[Ambush Trap|Ambush Traps]] using a melee Datajack will always disarm them.
|Having an active [[Trap Reconfigurator]] [[Exiles Vault Prototypes|Exile prototype]].
[[/List]]
From the [[https://www.gridsagegames.com/cogmind/manual.txt|official manual]]:
By default traps are programmed to trigger on detection of any foreign robot, a setting that can be modified via hacking. Known traps may be reprogrammed with an active melee Datajack by bumping them, and entire arrays of traps can be reprogrammed at once from nearby terminals. Reprogrammed traps will no longer recognize Cogmind or allies as a threat, instead reacting to local combat robots. As part of the new programming, each trap's sensitivity will also be set dangerously high, ensuring it will trigger whenever a hostile moves over it, regardless of propulsion.


[[Heading]]Collection[[/Heading]]
An enterprising Cogmind can, with the use of a [[Trap Extractors|Trap Extractor]], extract and store or pick up friendly traps for their own use. However, [[Chute Trap|Chute Traps]], [[Alarm Trap|Alarm Traps]] and [[Ambush Trap|Ambush Traps]] cannot be extracted to begin with. Stasis Traps also exhibit special behavior; they can be extracted but cannot be stored inside a Trap Extractor, and they can still be extracted even after they were triggered, as long as the stasis field they produce hasn't been depleted.

"Treads","Part Group","Treads have the highest support and the lowest speed. They are the most durable propulsion, but lower-tier units will still often be destroyed and replaced. They are commonly used by (and available from) [[Hauler|Haulers]] as well as heavy combat 0b10 bots, including [[Sentry|Sentries]], [[Heavy|Heavies]], and [[Behemoth|Behemoths]].

The slow movement speed of treads means [[Cogmind]] generally cannot outrun bots and will be forced to fight most encounters that it cannot avoid. Replacement treads can be difficult to obtain under duress since they are mostly equipped by powerful combat bots, and the best multislot treads are not commonly used by other bots until later in the game. In exchange, treads' high coverage and integrity (especially on mid- to late-game multislot treads), along with recoil reduction, allow them to support a combat bot and protect other parts. Treading bots that lack enough spare treads may choose a [[I]]half-track[[/I]] configuration, filling some propulsion slots with treads and some with [[Wheels]], as described in that article.

All multislot treads are capable of [[Special Propulsion Modes#siege mode|Siege Mode]], and some are capable of High Siege Mode. Most tread builds will transition entirely to multislot treads as soon as practicable, for their improved resilience and siege mode capability. A common place to make this transition is in [[Cetus]] after looting [[Centrium Heavy Treads]] from the [[Cetus Guard]].

While on treads, Cogmind is immune to damage from ramming hostile bots, and instead has a chance to crush them (unless they are large or huge or have greater than 50 core integrity). The chance to crush varies for each type of tread.

When active, treads confer immunity to knockback and reduce the accuracy penalty from recoil when firing large volleys.

[[Heading]]Further Scraptown Access[[/Heading]]
When Cogmind becomes a member of the UFD, the UFD HQ wall rises up on the map, and a few new areas open up with unique items and bot hacks available as possible benefits. See [[Scraptown#Possible right-side rooms|this page]] for additional details.

[[Heading]][[Optimus]] Alignment[[/Heading]]
After registering as a UFD member, there is an additional option to align 0bPrime for an additional hack, lore, and a lategame event in [[Protoforge]]. Aligning can be done by talking to Optimus in the HQ center area. This will add an additional + to the UFD name in the UI. Aligning will cause a civil war to break out if Cogmind hangs around the map too long, which can be used to grab some loot on the map. However, if Optimus dies in the war, Cogmind's UFD membership is revoked.

[[Heading]]Unique Hacks[[/Heading]]
Several new hacks become available with UFD alignment at [[Recycling Unit|Recycling Units]]:
[[Heading:2]][[GameText]]Force(Fedlink)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]
This hack hooks up additional Recycling Units to the UFD network. This provides a few more resources to be used for [[Scrapoid]] and [[Scraphulk]] summoning. [[Redacted]]Added resources provide additional support to the UFD during the [[Protoforge]] assault.[[/Redacted]]
[[Heading:3]]Resource Mechanics[[/Heading]]
The UFD resource count is a number that is indicated in the terminal after each UFD hack is performed. These resources go up automatically on each floor but are more substantially affected by performing Fedlink hacks. Each Fedlink provides +10 resources on the first hack of each depth, +4 resources on the second, and +2 on all subsequent hacks.
The initial resource count is 20 (plus an additional 4 upon entering -6) if Scraptown is located on -9 or -8. This number is bumped up to 35 (plus an additional 3 upon entering -5) if Scraptown is located on -7 to compensate for the extra skipped Factory floor.
Each depth, the number of resources goes up by a small amount:

[[Table]]
Readiness|Civil War Range|No Civil War Range||
Minimal|0-79|0-39||
Very Low|80-99|40-59||
Low|100-119|60-79||
Adequate|120+|80-99||
High|N/A|100-119||
Maximal|N/A|120+
[[/Table]]
For full details of what the readiness values indicate, see [[Protoforge#ufd_reinforcements|Protoforge UFD Reinforcements]].
[[Heading:4]]Example Numbers[[/Heading]]
Here are example numbers of a run with Scraptown on -9/-8 with 2 fedlinks performed per depth:
[[Table]]
Depth|Initial Resources|Ending Resources||
-6|24|38||
-5|41|55||
-4|58|72||
-3|75|89||
-2|91|103
[[/Table]]
In order to hit the maximum readiness by -2, 9 additional Fedlinks need to be performed outside of those 2 Fedlinks per depth, assuming no hacks that consume resources are used. To achieve it by -3, that number goes up to 16 additional Fedlinks.
[[Heading:2]][[GameText]]Force(Scraphulk)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]
This hack summons 1 blue controllable Scraphulk to the Recycling unit within a few turns of performing the hack. Each hack consumes 5 resources from the pool, and it cannot be used without aligning to Optimus and installing 6 Fedlinks first. The Scraphulk summoned depends on the depth.

"Warlord (Alignment)","Other","Aligning with [[Warlord]] is one of the major faction [[Alignment|alignments]] available to Cogmind in a run and can be done in his [[Warlord (Location)|Base]] in either -5 or -4 [[Upper Caves]]. Aligning with Warlord has effects on 2 major events later in the game. It triggers an event where Warlord, [[God Mode]], and friendly [[Derelict|Derelicts]] assault -2 [[Research]]. It also has a lategame effect in [[Command]]: [[Redacted]]When opening the Command seals, [[Warlord (Command)]] will appear along with a group of other friendly Derelicts.[[/Redacted]]
One Warlord alignment-related item is the [[Encrypted Comm Array]]. If Cogmind either compromises [[Garrison|Garrison]] or [[Sterilization|sterilizes]] [[DSF|DSFs]], Cogmind can receive the Comm Array and learn the depth of Warlord's base. If enough assistance is provided, a force multiplier can provide allies during the -2 assault and in the [[Redacted]]Command Seals[[/Redacted]]. After seeing Warlord in his base, the Comm Array is no longer of any use.

[[Heading]]Restrictions[[/Heading]]
Cogmind cannot align with Warlord in the following scenarios:
[[List]][[RIF]] is installed - The base will be hostile to Cogmind upon entering the base|Attacking [[Scraptown]] - The base will be hostile to Cogmind upon entry|[[Imprint]] - Warlord will be disappointed in Cogmind|[[UFD]] - Warlord will think Cogmind is a spy[[/List]]

[[Heading]]-2 Research Assault[[/Heading]]
The event will begin with the alert [[GameText]]ALERT: Engineering response network critical failure, offline[[/GameText]]. More announcements will show up, but the next most important one will be [[GameText]]Warlord currently on norther/central/southern western approach. All units hit designated targets[[/GameText]] which indicates where Warlord and [[God Mode]] will appear on the map. 50 turns after entering the map, another announcement [[GameText]]Trap arrays successfully disabled[[/GameText]] will come with all traps being removed from the map. 110 after entering the maps, [[GameText]]Machine network successfully disabled[[/GameText]] will indicate that every machine on the map is now shut down except for [[Garrison Access|Garrisons]] due to the follow-up message [[GameText]]Unrecognized interference restored Garrison access controls. Oops. Just blast them.[[/GameText]] 250 turns after entering the map and every 150 turns after that, 3 different assault squad spawns will appear from Garrisons and map exits with the message [[GameText]]Unaware assault squad dispatched in northeast/southeast/southwest/northwest quadrant.[[/GameText]] The spawn location will be indicated on the map. Every 100 turns 1 Derelict squad will spawn on the left side of the map for each tunnel. After 1000 turns on the map, Warlord will tell Cogmind that it is time to retreat and to open the [[Redacted]]Cave Seals in [[Command]] for the final push. He, or a random Derelict if Warlord is not within range, will also give Cogmind a manual hack that can be applied to open the Cave Seals without any need for hackware.[[/Redacted]]
[[Heading:2]]Downside of event[[/Heading]]
As a result of the Warlord assault, additional patrols will be dispatched in [[Testing]], [[Quarantine]], and [[Access]]. Patrols will increase by 40% in these maps. This is most significant in Access, upping the Patrol count from 20 to 28. A few Warlord bots will also appear at the entrance to these maps.
[[Image]]Research Warlord Squads.png|A few Derelict squads[[/Image]]

[[Heading]]Derelict Forces[[/Heading]]
The Derelict forces consist of many unique bots during this event. All of them appear as non-controllable allies that do not generate any alert for Cogmind. There are 3 spawn points in the form of giant tunnels. Each tunnel is dug out by a [[Borebot]] escorted by 2 [[Samaritan|Samaritans]]. They will dig straight across the map to the right side. Tiles that are dug out by Borebots are safe to travel on and will not cave-in. Warlord attack squads can vary greatly in composition but are made up of the following bots:
[[List]][[Butcher (7)|Butchers]]|[[Commander|Commanders]]|[[Dragon|Dragons]]|[[Fireman (7)|Firemen]]|[[Guerrilla (7)|Guerrillas]]|[[Hydra|Hydras]]|[[Knight]]|[[Marauder (8)|Marauders]]|[[Martyr (7)|Martyrs]]|[[Savage (7)|Savages]]|[[Thug (7)|Thugs]]|[[Troll|Trolls]]|[[Wasp (7)|Wasps]]|[[Wizard (7)|Wizards]][[/List]]
[[Image]]Research Warlord Assault Squads.png|0b10 Warlord response assault squad[[/Image]]The 0b10 forces come in groups of 3 bots. There are always 2 (not necessarily of the same type) of [[Executioner]], [[Striker]], and [[D-83 Annihilator]] bots along with a [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] full of bots. They roam around the map looking for bots to fight.
[[Heading:2]][[DD-05H]][[/Heading]]
Sometimes DD-05H will appear a few hundred turns into the invasion. It will run toward Warlord and then follow Warlord around for the duration of the event. When this happens, the [[Tinkerer]] PL-HR7 will also appear at one of the invasion entrances on the left side of the map. PL-HR7 will drop a [[Warlord Statue]] that Cogmind can use.

[[Heading]]Encrypted Comm Array[[/Heading]]
If Cogmind has aided Warlord forces by compromising Garrisons and DSFs, Cogmind may get 1 or 2 additional special escort squads based on the force multiplier. These special squads will head straight to Cogmind's location and follow. The higher the force multiplier, the stronger the squads available for escort. The special squads are as follows:
[[List]]Bridgeowners Association: Trolls|Cat Herders: Wasps|Death Star: Martyrs|Department No. 42: Firemen|Offensive Angels: Wasps|Golden Rifles: Commanders, Geurrillas, Surgeons, and Thugs|Grunt Murderers: Thugs|Gunslingers: Guerrillas|Lair Dwellers: Hydras|Lobotomizers: Wizards|Lucky Slug: Marauders|Magnificent Bastards: Mutants|Metalheads: Mutants|Knights of the Pentagonal Table: Knights|Railsplitters: Guerrillas|Shockpunchers: Wizards|Smaug Morners: Dragons|The Professionals: Commanders, Guerrillas, Knights, Surgeons, Trolls, and Wizards|Vikings: Butchers|Viscera Detail: Butchers and Savages[[/List]]
This event tends to be great for Cogmind. The primary downsides is that the machine network turns off relatively early into the event and locating the desired exit can be a pain. Getting stuck in a bad position without any Derelict allies can also be painful since the assaults, particularly the prototype bots and demolishers, pack quite a punch. However, the large number of alert-free allies and free loot from the bots fighting is great to any build. Like the Revision 17 event, this event will also cause the maps to have no Heavies. Finding any exit is usually possible by following the assault dispatch notifications. Assaults will be dispatched out of any Garrison or exit. The only exits that assaults do not come from are Quarantine prefab exits. In that case, using other infowar like terrain scanning and drones is the best way to locate these exits.","Spoiler","","","","","",""

"Warlord (Location)","Location","The Warlord base is a [[Caves]] [[Branch]] that appears on -5 or -4 and is named after the eponymous bot [[Warlord]]. This map is home to a large number of [[Derelict|Derelicts]] allied with Warlord and ready to fight. This branch is much more combat-oriented than many of the other Caves branches, with large waves of [[0b10]] bots assaulting the base. Initially the map is totally safe and filled with friendly NPCs, but after one of several conditions is met a large assault will begin.

[[Heading]]Map Makeup[[/Heading]]

[[Heading:2]]Right Side[[/Heading]]
The right side of the map is the same every run. There is a small cave-like area with an exit just above the starting area. There are a few [[Dirty Bomb Trap|Dirty Bomb Traps]] spread around this section of the map, so be aware if Cogmind has any [[Corruption]].
[[Heading:2]]Entrances[[/Heading]]
There are two entrances into the base: The first has some doors blocking a large corruption-cleansing System Quarantine Field Array, some opened Blast Doors, and a second set of regular doors opening up into 2 [[Marauder (6)|Marauders]]. This entrance has a large number of [[Fire Trap|Fire Traps]] installed. The second way in is either on the top or the bottom of the map, hidden behind some fake walls. These will automatically open if approached from the inside of the base. Behind these fake walls are a set of Sealed Heavy Doors, followed by one more set of fake walls. If Cogmind is [[RIF]] aligned or has become hostile to the [[UFD]], they will be detected and the entire base will be turned hostile. This occurs no matter which entrance is taken. It is safe to get the corruption cleanse, but any further will be dangerous.

[[Heading:2]]Interior[[/Heading]]
The interior of the base is different every run, but there are always 3 guaranteed rooms in every run.
[[Heading:3]]Vortex Lab[[/Heading]]
The Vortex Lab which is locked behind Sealed Heavy Doors with a [[Terminal]] to open it next to them. Inside are some [[Tinkerer|Tinkerers]], a lore Terminal, and a random assortment of Vortex weaponry. There will always be at least one pair of weapons from the following list:
[[List]][[Vortex Cannon]]|[[Vortex Driver]]|[[Vortex Lance]]|[[Vortex Rail]]|[[Vortex Rifle]]|[[Vortex Shotgun]][[/List]]
There may also be a single [[Vortex Catalyst Activator]], and if this is a seed where the [[Exiles (Group)|Exiles]] abandoned their hideout, [[EX-DEC]] will be present along with a [[BFG-9k Vortex Edition]].

[[Heading:3]]Warlord's Throne Room[[/Heading]]
In this room is are Warlord himself, 6 [[Thug (7)|Thugs]], 2 [[Knight|Knights]], and [[God Mode (Fake)|Fake God Mode]].

[[Heading:3]]Warlord's Stash[[/Heading]]
The final room is Warlord's stash which is locked by [[Reinforced Walls|Sealed Heavy Doors]]. The nearby Terminal can be hacked open with a special code obtained at a Terminal in [[Data Miner (Location)]].
The contents of Warlord's stash will vary every game with only the Vortex Chain Reactor being guaranteed. The contents can be as follows:
[[List]](guaranteed) [[Vortex Chain Reactor]]|[[Adv. Remote Shield]] or [[Adv. Remote Force Field]]|[[Exp. Phase Shifter]], [[Exp. Targeting Computer]], or [[Exp. Cloaking Device]]|1-2 of one of [[Electron Diverter]], [[Imp. Diametric Drive]], or [[Cld. Impulse Thruster]]|1-2 of one of [[Exp. Myomer Leg]] or [[Enh. Biometal Leg]]|1-2 of [[Cld.

Focal Shield]], or [[System Purifier]][[/List]]


[[Heading]]Alignment - [[Warlord (Alignment)|Warlord]][[/Heading]]
After entering Warlord's throne room, he will explain his plan to attack upper 0b10. As long as he survives until Cogmind exits the map and the 0b10 forces attack, he will attack on -2 [[Research]]. This will occur even if you turn the Warlord forces hostile before exiting the map. Keep in mind, it is possible for a fast Flight build to leave before the assault begins which will prevent the invasion. Along with this Research event, there is another event in [[Command]] that this affects: [[Redacted]]When the Command cave seals are opened, [[Warlord (Command)]] will pop out along with various other Warlord-aligned Derelicts.[[/Redacted]] This alignment is incompatible with RIF or attacking [[Scraptown]] as Warlord will be hostile when entering the base. It is also incompatible with [[Imprint]] or [[UFD]] alignment, as Warlord will not be happy talking with Cogmind. If the [[Encrypted Comm Array]] has been obtained, Warlord will thank Cogmind for assisting his forces. At this point, no more forces will be summonable and the Array can be dropped.

[[Heading]]0b10 Assault[[/Heading]]
There are several conditions that can kick off the 0b10 assault on Warlord's base:
[[List]]Moving 575 tiles
|Being on the map for 1300 turns
|Visiting Warlord in his throne room
|Opening up the Vortex Lab
|Destroying, in ways that are attributed to Cogmind, ~8 walls, doors or machines at any point vertically aligned and/or east of the main four-door entrance. Destruction from corruption triggering a Dirty Bomb Trap does not count, but destruction from corruption misfires do. When at least 4 but less than ~8 tiles or machines were destroyed, a warning announcement will appear: [[GameText]]Heightened seismic activity detected outside base. Stay alert for hostiles.[[/GameText]][[/List]]
After any of these conditions is met, large groups of 0b10 forces will come from an opening in either the top-right, middle-right, or bottom-right section of the map. These bots roam around the map randomly in groups, but usually come straight through the main entrance. When this happens, a large group of [[Bouncer|Bouncers]] will join the existing Marauder guards at the front gate. The first wave will usually be decimated by the entryway traps, but many more will follow.
There are a total of 14 assault waves, although it is highly recommended to leave the map before that many enemy bots appear. 10 turns after the first [[GameText]]MAIN.C incursion imminent. Mobilizing sentries[[/GameText]] announcement, the first wave will appear with the announcement [[GameText]]Northeast/Southeast/Central east cave walls breached[[/GameText]] indicating where the spawn location is. From then on, waves will spawn in 100 turn increments. Every 90 turns will give a [[GameText]]MAIN.C reinforcements approaching through caves, arriving soon[[/GameText]] announcement, and 10 turns after that the waves will spawn with an announcement of the wave composition. 4 squads can spawn per wave.
[[Image]]Warlord Assault Wave.png|A typical assault wave. Pictured are Saboteur, Hunter, Melee, and Grunt squads with Prototype support[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]]Assault Contents[[/Heading]]
The hostile forces are made up of different types of squads, each with their own squad leader:
[[List]]Behemoth Squad: [[Behemoth|Behemoths]]|Demolisher Squad: [[Demolisher|Demolishers]] with a [[Protector]]|Grunt Squad: [[Grunt|Grunts]], sometimes with a [[Specialist]] squad leader or [[Protector]] support|Hunter Squad: [[Hunter|Hunters]] and [[Swarmer|Swarmers]]|Melee Squad: [[Duelist|Duelists]], [[Brawler|Brawlers]] with a [[Protector]]|Mixed Squad: [[Grunt|Grunts]], [[Duelist|Duelists]], [[Brawler|Brawlers]], and [[Mechanic|Mechanics]]|Programmer Squad: [[Programmer|Programmers]]|Saboteur Squad: [[E-15 Imp|Imps]] and [[Grunt|Grunts]]|Swarmer Squad: [[Swarmer|Swarmers]][[/List]]
Sometimes these squads can spawn with ""Prototype Support"". When this happens, [[Executioner]] and [[Striker]] bots can also appear as part of a squad.
[[Heading:2]]Assisting[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Warlord Wall Lure.png|Luring hostiles around the wall[[/Image]]Staying and fighting near the main entryway is one of the best approaches to fighting the waves off. Join in with [[Launchers]] if you have them, but make sure to watch out for friendly fire. There is a bit of leeway, but hitting allies too many times will be considered a betrayal. Demolishers and Programmers are the highest priority targets since they can cause a lot of damage with Launchers and robot hacking respectively. Throwing Claymores and the Vortex Catalyst Activator that can both be obtained on this map are great options to destroy waves with ease. [[Visual Processing Units]] coupled with long ranged weapons are another good option to sit back and snipe bots from outside their typical range. The entrance defense is quite strong and will perform well most of the time. However, a squad of Programmers with an unlucky chain-assimilation of bots or some unchecked Demolishers will quickly tear any defense to pieces.
Even a build with little offensive power can help out in this part of the defense. Getting spotted first will cause hostiles to prioritize Cogmind for a while, even if they are getting shot by something else. This means that the Warlord bots can blast away all the hostiles while they are trying to run after you. This can work well for combat builds too, especially for combat hostiles without launchers of their own.
[[Heading:2]]Counterattack[[/Heading]]
In between the 4th and 5th waves, a Derelict will appear next to Cogmind to leave the base with the counterattack for cover. At this point, the majority of the combat Derelicts except for the guard Marauders and Bouncers will begin to head outside of the base. The strength of the counterattacks depends on a lot of factors. If the defense falters early on, the counterattack can get caught up fighting a bunch of squads and never make it out the entrance. Their tendency to trickle to the fight can be a big weakness if the hostiles are bunched up and can quickly take out Derelicts one at a time. On the other hand, [[Sapper|Sappers]] will dramatically increase the strength of any counterattack and can destroy big groups of bots on their own. 
The counterattack is usually a good time to exit the map whether it's successful or not. For airborne builds especially, even if the counterattack dies early on it can serve as a good distraction as you fly by.
[[Heading:2]]Base Infiltration[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Warlord Enhanced Allies.png|Enhanced Allies[[/Image]]In between the 7th and 8th assault waves is the final event of the map. A random spot in the Warlord base will be infiltrated and hostile assault squads will begin to appear from that location too with the announcement [[GameText]]Base interior infiltrated, regroup at designated outer cave rendezvous points[[/GameText]]. At the same time, a friendly group of 3 [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]] and 3 [[Enhanced Demolisher|Enhanced Demolishers]] will teleport into Warlord's throne room to assist. 2 of the Demolishers will immediately head toward the exit while the remaining bots follow Warlord around. At this point, all surviving Derelicts will head toward Warlord as he makes his way over to the map exit.
This is the last chance to exit the map with any amount of assistance. With assaults pouring in from the main entrance and a spot in the base itself, it is time to go. The Enhanced Demolishers have incredible loot including [[Cmb. Linear Gravjet|Cmb. Linear Gravjets]], [[Centrium Medium Armor Plating]], [[Coolant Network]], and the unique [[Chain Missile Launcher]].","Spoiler","","","","","",""

"Wastes","Location","Wastes is a [[0b10]]-controlled sub-floor in Factory that appears on most floors between -7 and -4. It can only be entered when Cogmind triggers a [[Chute Trap]]. Cogmind will get dropped in instantly. Any bots that have been dropped into chutes previously will be present on the map. Any nearby allies will drop in over time. Wastes can be a very brutal map for an unprepared player thanks to the 6 hostile [[C-40 Crusher|Crushers]] that can crush Cogmind's build in a few hits. There is an EMP that is on in some Wastes maps that fires every 100 turns and adds between 5 to 10% [[Corruption]] to Cogmind. This corruption can be reduced by EM [[Resistance Devices]] and prevented with [[Dynamic Insulation Systems]]. There are various broken, faulty, or otherwise low integrity parts scattered on the ground. These parts can be up to 2 ratings out of depth and can be good to try to [[Repair Station|repair]] or [[Scanalyzer|scan]], and [[Fabricator|fabricate]].
The layout of this map is semi-fixed. The entrance, exits, and general layouts of the map are similar, although the exact layout can vary a bit in which way paths are connected. There are wide 4 tile corridors that sometimes have 8 by 8 tile wide dead ends on the far ends of the map. Cogmind spawns on the left side, and the exit will always be in an 8 by 8 tile section on the right side of the map.

"Watcher","Bot Group","Watchers are [[Hover Units|hovering]] [[0b10]] non-combat bots that report hostiles upon visual contact to other allied bots. Watchers have a large distress signal area of effect compared to other bots. If Cogmind has a Watcher in line of sight then an animation will play when the Watcher alerts other bots. Combat bots and [[Operator|Operators]] will all be alerted to your location when this happens, after which combat bots will pursue and Operators will attempt to report hostiles at their [[Terminal]]. Watchers have [[Visual Processing Units]] that allow them to see bots at a larger range than the usual 16 tile range of vision, that can be desirable to loot from them. Watchers also have a unique [[Sensor Arrays|Sensor]] jamming effect while Cogmind is within a certain distance of them.
Watchers are arguably the most troublesome non-combat bot class in the game. Their large visual range, large reporting range, and sensor jamming abilities cause a wide variety of problems for many different build types. The most effective tool against them are [[Transmission Jammers]] which will block their reporting ability. While a Watcher is jammed, it is possible to tell if bots are nearby. If there are no bots nearby, nothing will happen when the Watcher is in range. However, if there are bots nearby, there will be a constant game log message of [[GameText]][Watcher type] distress signal jammed.[[/GameText]]
Watchers are quite difficult to kill, especially the W-44 Eye variant. Their naturally higher than usual avoidance and propensity for running away makes them hard to hit, and a Watcher that lives to run away is a Watcher that continues to summon more trouble from far away. For airborne builds, any melee weapons are reasonable choices to kill them, especially if positioning for a [[Sneak Attack]]. For grounded builds, many EM weapons can kill a Watcher in one or two hits, especially with the high amount of corruption gained. However, due to their low integrity, any weapons will easily destroy them.

"Weapons","Part Supergroup","Weapon components allow robots to deal damage or otherwise perform some utility.

Weapons can be from 9 general categories: [[Ballistic Cannons]], [[Energy Cannons]], [[Ballistic Guns]], [[Energy Guns]], [[Launchers]], [[Slashing Weapons]], [[Piercing Weapons]], [[Impact Weapons]], [[Special Melee Weapons]], and [[Special Weapons]].

[[Heading]]Multi-Weapon Volleys[[/Heading]]

Most weapons can be fired together as a volley, excluding Special Weapons, Special Melee Weapons, and [[Guided Weapons]]. Multiple Slashing, Piercing, and Impact melee weapons can be made to fire in one volley, although any weapons beyond the first are restricted to chance-based follow-up attacks.

[[Heading:2]]Volley Time Costs[[/Heading]]

Each weapon in a ranged multi-weapon volley will increase the volley\u2019s total time cost, with each weapon being more efficient time-wise:
[[Table]]Number of Weapons|Time cost||1|200||2|300||3|325||4|350||5|375||6+|400[[/Table]]
This is then modified by the sum of the delay stats of every weapon in the volley, then by the time cost reduction of an equipped [[Weapon Cyclers|Weapon Cycler]], [[Quantum Capacitor]], or [[Launcher Loader]], when applicable. A single volley may not cost less than 25 time units.

[[Heading:2]]Follow-Up Attacks[[/Heading]]

When multiple melee weapons are fired in a single volley, the first will always fire, and any others will have an independent chance to make a follow-up attack. Follow-up attacks are more likely when the primary weapon is slower than a given backup melee weapon. The chance may also be affected by supporting utilities. Follow-ups will add half the delay stat of the weapon that is following-up to the total time cost of the volley, before the time cost reduction of any [[Actuators]].

[[Heading:2]]Recoil[[/Heading]]

Certain weapons (Especially ballistic ones) suffer from recoil. The sum of every other weapon\u2019s recoil will be assessed as a penalty to each weapon in a volley containing weapon(s) suffering from recoil.

[[Heading]]Energy/Ballistic Gun Mechanics[[/Heading]]

If a volley is comprised exclusively of ballistic and/or energy guns and its original target is destroyed, a secondary target may be selected, prioritizing the most easily hit armed and active hostile in range. New targets may continue to be selected until no weapons remain in the volley. This mechanic is also available to melee follow-ups, and can be expanded to any weapon with use of a [[Heavy Servo Lattice]] or [[Spoiler]][[VL-GR5's Timing Chip]][[/Spoiler]]. However, unlike every other weapons, guns cannot cause overflow damage when damage dealt is greater than the target components integrity. Overflow damage is sent to a second part according to standard coverage rules, unless the destroyed part was armor, and overflow damage is always sent to armor if any is present.

[[Heading]]Weapon Types[[/Heading]]

[[Heading:2]][[Electromagnetic Weapons]]/[[Thermal Weapons]][[/Heading]]

Energy weapons generally have a shorter range, but benefit from a more easily predictable damage potential and little or no recoil. Thermal damage also generally transfers heat to the target, and may cause meltdowns in hot enough targets. Electromagnetic damage is capable of causing system corruption in targets. Anywhere from 50-150% of damage is applied as system corruption. EM damage is additionally capable of disrupting hit parts or even robot cores, as well as causing chain reactions in target power components. 

[[Heading:2]][[Ballistic Weapons]][[/Heading]]

Ballistic weapons generally have a longer effective range and more destructive critical strikes, but suffer from less predictable damage and high recoil. Some kinetic projectiles, especially hypervelocity variants, are capable of penetrating one or more consecutive targets. Kinetic cannon hits also blast usable matter off target robots and have a damage-equivalent chance to cause knockback, with a (10 - range) * 5 modifier and a +/-10% per size class (Tiny/Small/Medium/Large/Huge) difference between the target and medium size (targets knocked into another robot may also damage and displace it). The amount of matter created per cannon projectile impact is randomized from between zero up to the absolute value of the weapon's salvage modifier, but only applies for those weapons with a negative salvage modifier below -2.

[[Heading:2]][[Launchers]][[/Heading]]

Launchers may deal either electromagnetic or explosive damage.  Damage from launchers is spread across targets in their area of effect, dividing damage into separate chunks before affecting a robot, where each chunk selects its own target part (though they may overlap). Launchers also suffer from damage falloff: targets at the edge of the area of effect will sustain less damage then targets near the center. Explosive launchers carry high salvage penalties and will tend to destabilize hit terrain. Electromagnetic launchers can initiate chain reactions in power components attached to [[Cogmind]] or on the ground and disrupt hit components or robot cores.

[[Heading:2]][[Impact Weapons]][[/Heading]]

Impact melee weapons have a damage-equivalent chance to cause knockback, with a +/-10% per size class (T/S/M/L/H) difference between attacker and target. Targets knocked into another robot may also damage and displace it. A robot hit by another displaced robot has a chance to itself be displaced and sustain damage, where the chance equals the original knockback chance further modified by +/-10% per size class difference between the blocking robot and the knocked back robot, and the resulting damage equals the original damage inflicted by the weapon after applying the +10% robot analysis damage modifier if applicable, further divided by the blocker size class if that class is greater than 1 (where Medium = 2, and so on).

Impact weapons ignore relative coverage when determining which components to affect, and are therefore effective at destroying fragile systems regardless of armor and other protection. By ignoring coverage, there is an equal chance for an attack to hit any given part, where each slot of a multislot part also has a separate and equivalent chance to be hit. A target's core also counts as one slot for that purpose. In addition, for every component crushed by an impact, its owner's system is significantly corrupted (+25-150%), though electromagnetic resistance can help mitigate this effect.

[[Heading:2]][[Slashing Weapons]][[/Heading]]

Slashing melee weapons are generally very damaging, and most are also capable of severing components from a target without destroying them.

[[Heading:2]][[Piercing Weapons]][[/Heading]]

Piercing melee weapons inflict less collateral damage, but are more likely to hit a robot's core, and get double the melee momentum damage bonus. The core exposure bonus is 8%, the same as an [[Exp. Core Analyzer]]

[[Heading:2]][[Special Weapons]] and [[Special Melee Weapons]][[/Heading]]

Special weapons are usually intended to serve some utility rather than directly deal damage.","","","","","Autonomous Weapons,Backup Lasers,Guided Weapons,Hyp.

"Wheel","Part","","","","","","","",""
"Wheels","Part Group","Wheels are the most fragile ground propulsion type, but have a lower overweight penalty than any other type of propulsion. They are commonly used by (and available from) almost all non-combat 0b10 bots, other than [[Hauler|Haulers]].

Because of the low overweight penalty, it is viable for bots to use wheels even if they are several times overweight.

The low overweight penalty of wheels, and their ready availability from the ubiquitous green bots, gives them some niches:
[[List]]
As a sole propulsion type for bots that carry massive inventories, including certain [[RIF]] builds.
|In combination with [[Treads]] to form a [[I]]half-track[[/I]] configuration, where both wheels and treads are equipped at once. [[Cogmind]] activates wheels outside combat to benefit from the fast movement speed, and treads in combat for the knockback immunity and recoil reduction. Half-tracking is useful for bots that have not found enough spare treads, to reduce the churn of treads. The ease of obtaining wheels makes them a viable secondary propulsion type.
|As backup propulsion. If all of Cogmind's propulsion is destroyed, it may have an extremely slow movement speed on core propulsion. Equipping just one wheel will often reduce the movement delay to a manageable amount.
[[/List]]
The main downside of wheels compared to other ground propulsion is their fragility. Cogmind can easily loot replacement wheels from green bots, but will still go through wheels fairly quickly.

"Zhirov (Location)","Location","Zhirov is a [[Caves]] [[Branch]] that appears on -5 or -4 and is home to the eponymous bot [[Zhirov]]. This is a safe map with no hostile spawns and only friendly bots, although Cogmind should be wary of [[Corruption]] triggering misfires that anger Zhirov. Detaching all ranged weapons is advised.
This map initially appears to be a small section of caves with only an exit. Approaching the left wall will cause the cave walls to slide away to reveal some Cloak Generators and some larger Sealed Heavy Doors blocking the way. These Cloak Generators surround the entire outside of Zhirov's lab. Continuing to the left will cause the doors to slide down and reveal Zhirov himself who will greet you. [[Perun]] and [[Svarog]] guard just above and below the entrance on the left side.
There are a large collection of [[Terminal|Terminals]] to the left of Zhirov. The first terminal going counterclockwise contains some lore records and the depths of, [[Quarantine]], [[Testing]], and [[Command]]. The second contains Analyses for [[Q-Series]], [[Striker|Strikers]], [[Executioner|Executioners]], and [[Alpha 7|Alpha 7s]]. The third contains 4 Prototype ID Banks. The fourth contains Schematics for an [[Assault Drone Bay]], [[Exp. Heat Sink]], [[Exp. Optical Array]], and [[Imp. Arc Thrower]]. This is the only way that Assault Drone Bays can be obtained. In the room just below this, there is a series of 3 Terminals that describe Zhirov's past since arriving on Tau Ceti IV.
Near the center area there are two [[Alien Artifacts]] with explanatory Terminals. The left will either be an [[Integrated Reactor]] or an [[Integrated Dissipator]]. The right will always be a [[Transdimensional Reconstructor]].
At the bottom of the map are some broken bots and an assorted collection of parts. None of these parts are guaranteed, although there will always be some available. The list of available parts is as follows:
[[List]][[Adv. Myomer Leg]], [[Cld. Gravmag System]], or [[Cld. Nuclear Pulse Thruster]]|[[Fusion Reactor]] or [[Hvy. Antimatter Reactor]]|[[Adv. Energy Well]], or [[Adv. Power Amplifier]]|[[Exp. Core Shielding]], [[Exp. Power Shielding]], [[Exp. Propulsion Shielding]], [[Exp. Utility Shielding]], or [[Exp. Weapon Shielding]]|[[Particle Accelerator]], [[Prc. Matter Filter]], or [[Imp. Matter Compressor]]|[[Adv. System Shield]] or [[Adv. Hacking Suite]][[/List]]
[[Image]]Zhirov Explosions.webp|Zhirov leaving with flair[[/Image]]
Unlike the Cloak Generators in [[Zion]], these machines are the real deal. If destroyed, there are some major consequences that follow. Zhirov and friends will immediately turn aggressive and begin to attack. A large group of friendly [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]] wil teleport in and start attacking Zhirov. Zhirov will attempt to teleport out when his core integrity gets to about half. He will first say [[GameText]]Looks like we have to say goodbye to this place, and you[[/GameText]]. This will rig a large number of explosions to go off in about 10 turns. This happens even if the Cloak Generators are already intact and Zhirov is attacked.

[[Heading]][[Zhirov (Alignment)|Alignment - Zhirov]][[/Heading]][[Image]]Testing SGEMP.png|The SGEMP room in Testing[[/Image]]
After entering and exiting the Terminal room, Zhirov will ask Cogmind to steal the [[SGEMP Prototype]] from Testing and bring it to [[Access]]. If done, Zhirov, Perun, and Svarog will show up in Access and will give Cogmind perfect map intel and follow until Zhirov falls below half core integrity. If a [[Core Reset Matrix]] is used prior to Access but Cogmind still carries the SGEMP, Zhirov and his allies will turn hostile and fight Cogmind to the death instead.
There is a second part of this quest that continues in [[Command]]. [[Redacted]]After destroying the first form of [[MAIN.C (Shell)|MAIN.C]] in Command, Zhirov, Perun, and Svarog will show up and Zhirov will activate the Modified SGEMP and disable all 0b10-aligned bots on the map.[[/Redacted]]

[[Heading]]Fighting[[/Heading]]
Fighting Zhirov and gaining anything from the encounter is not an easy task. Although he has some nice loot, his tendency to teleport out at the slightest hint of danger and explosive aftermath even on a successful kill is very frustrating to deal with. One option is to loot Perun and Svarog while ignoring Zhirov and simply exiting the map safely. These 2 can still have some good parts, although they have nothing as lucrative as Zhirov with the guaranteed inventory drops of [[Deep Network Scanner]], [[Quantum Router]], a [[Transdimensional Reconstructor]], and a [[Zhirov Special]]. Only Zhirov can set off the traps and cause the group to leave.
The best way to safely grab all the loot is with [[Master Tearclaws]] that can be looted from [[Master Thief|Master Thieves]]. These Tearclaws can strip all 3 bots of their parts with little risk of explosives. Just make sure Zhirov doesn't fall below 80 core integrity. The Tearclaws can even remove the inventory items without requiring Zhirov to actually be destroyed. The idea is to shoot one of the bots from just outside of one of the rooms and then retreat behind one of the doorways. This will let you safely use the melee Tearclaws while only getting attacked by 1 bot at a time.","Spoiler","","","","","",""
"Zhirov Special","Part","The Zhirov Special is an inventory item similar to a [[Sapper Charge]]. It can be activated to start a 10-turn timer that will cause it to violently explode. It can be obtained by destroying [[Zhirov]] or having a [[Master Thief]] steal it from his inventory. When Cogmind is standing on it, pressing > or right-clicking on Cogmind will start its 10-turn explosion timer. Doing so again will interrupt the timer, which can be useful in scenarios such as the player accidentally activating it. Note that both activation and deactivation take an entire turn, meaning only 9 of the 10 turns can actually be used to prepare for or escape its high-damage 20-radius explosion. Picking up an active Zhirov Special will not halt its countdown, and it can explode from Cogmind's inventory.
The explosion is not attributed to Cogmind, meaning it will not raise [[Alert]] or attribute Cogmind any kills or [[Score#value|value-based score]].

[[Heading]]Avoiding Damage[[/Heading]]
While the Zhirov Special's very high explosive damage should preferably be avoided, its large explosion radius makes escaping somewhat difficult. Without a high movement speed or conveniently-shaped [[Reinforced Walls]] that could contain the explosion, other type of movement such as teleportation would be required to avoid the explosion.
If attempting to escape the explosion through high movement speed, consider making sure the area is clear of [[Stasis Trap|Stasis Traps]] beforehand or using a [[Stasis Canceller]]. If using a [[Transdimensional Reconstructors|Transdimensional Reconstructor]] for that purpose, make sure to not stand on the Zhirov Special when teleporting, as the Transdimensional Reconstructor would bring it along.
Alternatively, using an explosive damage-reducing utility such as an [[Exp. Shock Absorption System]] preferably paired with a [[Force Fields|Force Field]] or similar damage reduction effect can help cut the damage significantly.

[[Heading]]Usage Strategy[[/Heading]]
As the Zhirov Special's explosion does not raise Alert, it can be used to destroy most structures, machines and robots with few consequences. Keep in mind that [[Launchers|Launcher]] misfires due to [[Corruption]], explosive [[Traps]] and [[Demolisher|Demolishers]] are all capable of destroying the Zhirov Special. [[Cutter|Cutters]] can also interfere, and in the worst-case scenario their [[Concussive RPG]]s can knock back the Zhirov Special away from your target.
As the Zhirov Special is a non-part inventory item, [[Recycler|Recyclers]] will not attempt to pick it up.

"Zion","Location","Zion is a [[Caves]] [[Branch]] that appears on -7 or -6 and is the home to a large number of [[Derelict]] [[Zionite|Zionites]]. It is a general safe haven for all types of Derelict bots and has a ton of lore available by talking with all sorts of Zionites. Similar to Caves, [[Scrap]] and [[Derelict Log|Derelict Logs]] can appear on the ground here. Aside from one relatively harmless event, there are no hostile bots that appear on this map unless Cogmind attacks or attempts to enter while aligned with [[RIF]] or after becoming hostile to the [[UFD]]. The System Quarantine Field Array at the entrance of the map will cleanse all [[Corruption]]. It is strongly recommended to detach any ranged weapons until cleansing corruption to avoid any misfires that will turn the map hostile. RIF-aligned or UFD-hostile Cogmind can only go as far as triggering the cleanse at the quarantine array. Going any further will turn Zion hostile.
Zion maps are randomly generated but will always have the same overall appearance. There is a small Caves-like section on the east containing the spawn point and exit to Proximity Caves. To the left is the Quarantine Array machine guarded by 2 friendly [[Marauder (6)|Marauders]]. The bulk of Zion is contained within a large hollow square shape. All of the unique prefabs are contained within this area of the map. To the top left is the locked entrance to the [[Zion Deep Caves]]. Below that is a [[Tinkerer]] next to the Conduit Teleporter, 4 [[Mutant (6)|Mutants]], the [[Imprinter]], and some more Tinkerers next to the Imprinting Machine.

[[Heading]]Alignment - [[Imprint|Imprinting]][[/Heading]]Walking into the Imprinting machine will allow Cogmind to Imprint which has some major gameplay effects. The main change is that Cogmind can no longer use normal hacks at [[Terminal|Terminals]] and can now only use a specific set of randomized Zionite hacks. The 4 Mutants that guard the Imprinter will also turn purple and begin to follow you. There is an additional unique effect in [[Command]]: [[Redacted]]When the Command cave seals are opened, powerful Zionite bots will pop out along with various other Zionite-aligned Derelicts. These Zionites will be controllable (blue) rather than purple if a [[Core Reset Matrix]] is used.[[/Redacted]] This alignment has the following incompatibilities:
[[List]][[FarCom]]: The Imprinter will warn a FarCom-aligned Cogmind against trying to use the machine. If the machine is used anyway, the Zionites will take it as an attack and turn hostile.|RIF: A RIF-aligned Cogmind will turn Zion hostile when attempting to enter in the first place.|[[Revision 17]]: Revision 17 will be afraid of an imprinted Cogmind and will not attack -3 [[Research]].|[[Scraptown]] hostilities: Zion will become hostile to Cogmind who has become hostile to the UFD.|[[UFD]]: If Cogmind is a UFD member, The Imprinter will tell Cogmind that the imprinting machine vetting process will take a while and to come back another time.|[[Warlord]]: Warlord will be disappointed in an imprinted Cogmind and will not attack -2 Research.[[/List]]

[[Heading]]Fighting[[/Heading]]
Fighting Zion can be a risky feat for an unprepared Cogmind, but not particularly challenging if going in with a plan. The majority of the [[Zionite|Zionites]] are initially unarmed, although they can scavenge through the Twisted Machinery tiles in order to find several (usually weak) types of guns or melee weapons. Zionites will also appear out of the machinery tiles and instantly attack. This will only happen if Cogmind is within a few tiles of some machinery, so using explosive weaponry on these tiles is highly recommended to avoid unnecessarily fighting extra bots. It is not possible to destroy this machinery beforehand, as destroying too many of these tiles will cause Zion to turn hostile. After attacking, use launchers to take the machines out at range to avoid getting sneak attacked.
One of the largest benefits and threats to fighting Zion is the [[Z-Hero]] spawn. There is a chance that a hostile Hero will spawn at the Caves exit and roam around the map. It is important to have a plan to deal with some of the stronger Heroes like [[99-TNT]] and [[P1-3CE]], even if that plan is only to spot them first and run to avoid getting spotted in return. Other heroes like [[ME-RLN]] are easier to kill. All of them can provide incredibly strong unique loot. Another big reason to fight is the [[Imprinter Data Core]] that will guarantee access to the [[Zion Deep Caves]] if no other methods are available. One thing to note is that the Imprinter will not stick around long after attack. 300 turns after Cogmind angers Zion, the Imprinter will disappear and it will not be possible to get her Data Core. Starting hostilities by attacking her is recommended for this reason.

There are a wide variety of encounters in Zion. A few are useless, some are more niche, but most are going to have a use in many builds. Every game has a half dozen or so of these encounters available and it is likely that most builds will get something nice out of the trip.
[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There are 2 types of exits in Zion:[[List]][[Proximity Caves]] exit: This exit is on the top right side of the map near where Cogmind spawns.|[[Zion Deep Caves]] exit: This exit is on the top left side of the map protected by locked blast doors. The doors can be unlocked with a random Derelict event that will provide the hacking codes or with the same codes obtained by using the [[Imprinter Data Core]]. Additionally, the doors can be broken into with a very powerful Impact weapon ([[Impact Mace]] with high speed momentum required), an overloadable Thermal cannon like a [[Cld. Particle Cannon]], or by using a [[Plasma Cutters|Plasma Cutter]]. The Sealed Blast Doors have an armor value of 45 with 0% thermal resistance but many other strong resistances.[[/List]][[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]
[[List]](+/-) [[Hunter]] attack: A Hunter disguised as a Derelict will sneak up to the gates of Zion and attack the Marauder guards. This will usually result in the quarantine array being destroyed and the Hunter losing the fight. The dropped parts can be collected by Cogmind but will quickly self-destruct.[[/List]]","Spoiler","","","","","",""
"Zion Deep Caves","Location","The Zion Deep Caves, or ZDC, is a [[Branch]] off of [[Zion]] that seems to serve as a sort of base of operations for the [[Imprinter]] and the [[Zionite (Group)|Zionites]]. This is a very combat oriented map that requires a lot of preparation to complete entirely. It is possible for a very fast flight build to sneak in, grab one or two things, and escape, but the presence of the perfect-tracking 24 speed [[Z-Imprinter]] makes things tough.

[[Heading]]Layout[[/Heading]]
The bulk of the map has a predefined layout except for the right starting point and middle-left exit area which are slightly different every time. These two random areas are mostly empty but can contain small groups of [[Assembled (4)|Assembled]] and a disabled [[Surveybot 24]]. To the left of the starting area are a big Z-Facility machine, a huge explosive Z-Power, and some [[Z-Technician|Z-Technicians]] working on the machine. Above and below are [[Z-Light (5)|Z-Light]] guards. On the top and left side there are Zionite item stashes. To the left side of the exit area is a collection of assorted broken Derelict bots and highly damaged parts. There is an [[Exiles (Location)|Exiles]] item near the top of the area. The far left is an Impregnable Wall which contains a large amount of Assembled and 2 [[Assembler|Assemblers]]. The wall is guarded by a [[Golem]] above and below. There are also some Wall Chambers that drop [[GOLEM Unit|GOLEM Units]] when destroyed. The units will start regrowing into hostile Golems.
[[Heading:2]][[Z-Imprinter]][[/Heading]]
After entering the center portion of the map, there will be an alert [[GameText]]NEW_ZION: Z-Facility proximity alert.[[/GameText]] When this happens, the Z-Imprinter will appear at the exit and head directly to Cogmind, with 2 [[Z-Light (5)|Z-Lights]] following behind.
[[Heading:2]]Impregnable Wall[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]ZDC Wall Activation Zone.png|Approximate wall activation zone[[/Image]]
The Impregnable Wall on the far left side of the map cannot be destroyed by any method. However, a small portion of the wall in the center will open automatically when Cogmind enters a nearby area or if one of the wall chambers containing GOLEM Units is opened.

[[Heading]]Rewards[[/Heading]]
While quite challenging, there are some very strong unique rewards on this map. GOLEM units are only available here and can provide a strong build in a-box. [[Asb. Focal Cannon|Focal Cannons]] will tear through most anything in the game quite easily. The [[Asb. Combat Suite]] is a unique part that combines [[Phase Shifters]], [[Ranged Targeting Utilities]], and [[Core Analyzers]] in a single slot. The [[Surveybot 24 Chip]] is the strongest type of [[Terrain Scan Processors|Terrain Scan Processor]] in the game. [[Zio. Weapon Casing|Weapon Casings]] can protect late-game super-weapons from harm. The [[Zio. Biocell]] is an early way to gain a mostly identical [[Exp. Energy Well]] early in the game.
