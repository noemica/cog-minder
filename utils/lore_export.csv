"Record","0b10","2210","In 2210 the ISCS Cetus received several ISC messages sent from the Solar System in 2198, warning that the Solar System was under attack by an alien race known as the Sigix. The ISC advised that all outbound ships continue beyond their intended destination to avoid pursuit and preserve the Human species. After a brief stop at Tau Ceti IV to deploy Project Seraph, the Cetus left for an unknown destination."
"Record","0b10","Access Level","The highest subsurface floor of Complex 0b10, heavily garrisoned in preparation for a possible Sigix attack."
"Record","0b10","Alpha Centauri System","A triple star system located 1.34 parsecs from the Sun, making it the closest star system to the Solar System. Destination of the ISCS Centaurus."
"Record","0b10","Arc Thrower","This newer weapon has only been recovered once, attached to a mutant Derelict, and is surprisingly effective for Derelict Weaponry. It is similar to the arc projector, but fires multiple weaker arcs for a chance to quickly shut down more than one target system. Interestingly, arc throwers do not show signs of usual Derelict construction, thus their origin is still a mystery."
"Record","0b10","Archives","A decommissioned network hub formerly connected to Complex 0b1. It is now linked to the Cetus Mainframe and used as a backup."
"Record","0b10","Authchip","Early Fabricator systems were more openly accessible, but rampant abuse by Derelict intruders made it necessary to introduce an authorization system to limit unauthorized use of resources. An authchip is now required to load schematics and initiate build orders, and the chips have been divided by schematic category to further limit the potential for abuse."
"Record","0b10","Battle Rifle","A prime example of Derelict Weaponry, the common Battle Rifle and its heavy variant have greater damage potential than other ballistic weapons of their class, but at the same time suffer from inconsistent application of force at the point of impact, leading to less effective results under some conditions. Nonetheless, quite a few Derelicts rely on it as a primary or secondary weapon."
"Record","0b10","Beamcaster","The Beamcaster appears to be a significantly modified heavy laser, but with capabilities more comparable to the common plasma rifle. Its beam retains its full strength even at up to 50% greater distance than most similar energy weapons, and is one of the most reliable of the known Derelict component designs."
"Record","0b10","Blade Trap","A simple trap mechanism, though the effectiveness of forcibly detaching target components is not to be underestimated where hostile forces are incapable of rebuilding in the field."
"Record","0b10","Brute Force Hacks","Like Trojans, increased use of this new class of offensive hack represents a shift in Derelict tactics. They have begun learning how to exploit system weaknesses to achieve some greater effect at the cost of destroying the system itself and losing any chance at further interaction. Some like Force(Overload) might prompt a complete redesign of the Fabricator system, as it was certainly never intended to be capable of such a dangerous effect. There is some satisfaction, however, in knowing that whatever Derelict uses that particular hack never makes it more than a few meters away from the machine."
"Record","0b10","Cargo Convoy","Escorted A-27 Freighters are now responsible for delivering newer prototypes to DSF locations throughout Complex 0b10. As these prototypes are valuable for their higher rating and fact that they have been tested and confirmed non-faulty, they are often distributed through the Garrison network for added security."
"Record","0b10","Caves","Approximately 15% of the subsurface cave systems surrounding Complex 0b1 were incorporated into the initial construction of Complex 0b10, but many more remain untouched. These caves are occupied by Derelict robots. Recent activity suggests there could be more substantial populations deeper in the caves."
"Record","0b10","Centrium","A protective alloy surprisingly light for its durability, mostly due to a perfectly arranged network of sparse particles that fluctuates to distribute both physical and immaterial force across its entire surface both quickly and evenly. Its properties seem tuned to be the perfect protection in space, and indeed the Leopard hull is mostly constructed of this material. I've also created a somewhat hardened variant that performs better in the presence of gravity."
"Record","0b10","Chute Trap","Short one-way channels from the primary Factory levels into Waste subzones. While normally used to dispose of larger scrap, the entrances to these channels are hidden such that they can also serve as Traps. If triggered by a hostile robot, the channel is permanently sealed from within to prevent escape, and is then relocated to a new area so that trap locations cannot be perfectly mapped."
"Record","0b10","Cogmind","I've made an interesting discovery: The ""Derelict"" recently causing mayhem in the lower levels of Complex 0b10 is actually the missing LRC-V3. Its behavior is quite unpredictable, no doubt a contributing factor in my misclassification since it resembles some of the actual Derelicts lurking in the depths. It won't be much use to capture it now, as it has clearly been tainted from its ""experiences,"" but I should allow it to continue on its own for a time, as this is the perfect opportunity to collect data for further analysis before destroying it. Somewhat vexing is the backdoor I installed into every Leopard FTL Device prototype has been completely non-responsive. In any case, I've thought of a fitting name for this most wonderful of devices. I call it the Cogmind."
"Record","0b10","Combat Hover Systems","As future engagements in off-world locations could very well involve traversing more hostile terrain than seen here on Tau Ceti IV, in order to bring heavier ground-based firepower to bear a new line of combat-oriented hover systems are under development. These include built-in armor and can support nearly as much mass as legs, though move somewhat more slowly than standard hover systems. Demolishers are the first to rely on this technology, but more classes have entered the testing phase as well."
"Record","0b10","Complex 0b1","Primary subterranean facilities below the faux Human city, developed over the several decades following deployment of Project Seraph in 2211. Surrounding the complex are cave systems and old mining tunnels now populated by Derelicts."
"Record","0b10","Complex 0b10","New subterranean complex under construction below the Leopard landing site, providing quicker access to the battle site and ship itself. The complex is divided into three primary levels--Materials, Factory, and Research--with a design focused on efficient development and production of advanced defensive forces."
"Record","0b10","Concept Components","Pre-experimental components still in an early design phase with therefore generally higher faulty rates but also in many cases appear to be promising candidates for fulfilling a useful role. Factors contributing to their development include a better understanding of Sigix Technology, new and effective amalgams of existing technologies, and some even draw on knowledge gained from harvesting Derelict designs. Concept work is carried out solely in the heavily-defended Protoforge, which handles both construction and initial adjustments in the surrounding labs until a new technology is ready for more thorough testing in other annexes."
"Record","0b10","Containment Facilitator","Originally derived from Sigix stasis generator technology as a method of controlling malfunctioning prototype variants, this single-use device is so effective at handling multiple targets that once mass production is feasible it is a prime candidate for deployment among front line combat units."
"Record","0b10","Cooled Power Sources","Among the prototype power sources are cooled variants capable of being pushed to double their energy output at the cost of possibly suffering temporary shutdowns and weakened structural integrity. No robot designs currently employ this technology, but it is being developed as a theoretical way to support vastly more powerful shield generators, or applied in other areas where only short but powerful bursts of energy are required."
"Record","0b10","Cooled Weapons","Taking cues from Sigix Technology, I've been able to vastly improve the efficiency and versatility of early energy weapon designs. Based on recent prototype tests, cooled variants of these weapons output approximately one-third of their previous heat during normal operation, and can be overloaded with a dual burst of energy for twice as much damage potential. However, use of this feature would have to remain situational, as there is a small possibility of severe negative side effects. Overloading a cooled weapon also generates three times as much heat per shot, but that puts it on par with the original design and is often worth the significant damage boost."
"Record","0b10","Core Stripper","While not always successful, this alternative melee weapon used by one of the Sigix strikes a target and delivers a surge of directed energy that aims to rip that target apart at its weakest seams. The Core Stripper is equipped with its own targeting system and tiny thrusters to correct its swing arc while in motion, thus even quickly moving targets have difficulty evading it."
"Record","0b10","DSF","Distributed Storage Facility. An area designated for storage of materials and components. Distribution serves two purposes, making local access to resources easier while also minimizing losses in the event that one is compromised. DSF entrances are temporarily sealed in the event that potential threats appear in the areas they serve."
"Record","0b10","Derelict","A generic term for the many partially functioning and/or errant robots that exist in the Caves and Mines surrounding Complex 0b1. Some are failed experiments, others are common robots glitched beyond repair. In some cases they may communicate with one another and exhibit rudimentary forms of organization, or have developed robotic ecosystems of their own. While I could do more to control their spread, they generally don't cause too much trouble nor pose much of a threat, and I find them an interesting study in robotic evolution. I did unfortunately have to displace some of my favorite Derelict populations during the construction of Complex 0b10."
"Record","0b10","Derelict Prototype","While a majority of Derelict robots are old variants of my own creation, in some cases with minor alterations, reports suggest a growing number of completely new robots under development by the so-called Tinkerers. This is likely in response to the threat Derelict communities perceive in the expansion of Complex 0b10. The Knight, Troll, Dragon, and Hydra classes are especially interesting."
"Record","0b10","Derelict Rail Weapons","Derelicts have been working to develop longer-range cannons for use by larger robots, likely to facilitate guerilla warfare tactics to reduce their generally enormous losses whenever they decide to enter Complex 0b10. The first known type, a version of the gauss cannon, is known as the slug cannon and certainly does significant damage for its weight, but at a reduced accuracy. The newer hypervelocity variant, the bore cannon, is even less accurate, but capable of penetrating multiple targets with a high chance of disabling whatever it penetrates."
"Record","0b10","Derelict Weaponry","Wherever possible Derelict robots tend to salvage and use discarded technology from my operations, but more recently they have begun to develop weapon systems of their own, showing a keen fascination with melee combat and unreliable but sometimes surprisingly powerful projectile weapons. These and other traits again prove that survival is indeed a strong creative motivator. Common Derelict weapons include the Beamcaster, Battle Rifle, and Derelict Rail Weapons, and even some electromagnetic designs like the Riot Gun and Arc Thrower."
"Record","0b10","Dirty Bomb Trap","Likely another product of Derelict Tinkerers, when triggered this bomb generates an unusually high concentration of electromagnetic waves across its radius, capable of disabling an entire squad. An increasing number of patrols sent deep into the Caves have fallen to a combination of these traps and subsequent ambushes."
"Record","0b10","Dirty Datajack","A new type of short-range datajack presumably developed by Derelict Tinkerers. The design is novel, diverging significantly from those developed by my researchers. It is extremely quick to use, but limited in what it can do as a result of lacking access to the garrison relay network. These opportunistic hacking devices are still incapable of any form of direct control and therefore do not yet pose a serious threat. Patrols in the Caves have recently recovered several large stashes of these, suggesting that Derelicts could be staging for some kind of attack."
"Record","0b10","Disintegrator","Based on a rudimentary understanding of the Sigix Matter Drive, this weapon vaporizes a thin cylinder of matter over a short distance. The effect is uniform throughout the cylinder, and concentrated so tightly that zero collateral damage is caused beyond impaled target components, though direct hits almost always completely destroy the local component. A single shot requires a significant pool of energy, which is theoretically sustainable in combination with the latest reactor designs."
"Record","0b10","Dragon","A Derelict Prototype apparently designed specifically to counter Complex 0b10 defenses, employing two nova cannons, presumably to counter Behemoths, as well as a powerful new type of Flamer. If more designs like this enter construction, I may have to launch a pre-emptive strike on the Caves before this escalation becomes a problem."
"Record","0b10","EMDS","The Electromagnetic Delivery System encapsulates a powerful EM pulse device inside a large hypervelocity shell, making it possible to simultaneously strike multiple hardened targets, or penetrate a wall to hit such targets on the other side without a loss of either force or electromagnetic potential. Rather than using multi-direction pulses, each pulse is directed towards a specific target component to increase the chances of corrupting its parent system through brute force."
"Record","0b10","Earth","Third planet from the Sun in the Solar System. Terrestrial homeworld of Human civilization. By the late 21st century that civilization drained the planet's resources and destabilized the environment to the point that global-scale technology was necessary to maintain an increasingly fragile planet."
"Record","0b10","Epsilon Eridani System","Home to a spectral class K2 star 3.22 parsecs from the Sun, Epsilon Eridani is a young star system containing multiple rocky asteroid belts and a number of exoplanets potentially capable of supporting life. Destination of the ISCS Eridanus."
"Record","0b10","Experimental Components","One of the first applications of Sigix Technology has been to make improvements to existing components, focusing on those which will be useful even after major technological breakthroughs replace certain classes of components entirely. However, as even more advanced technologies reach completion some Experimental Components may be retired as well. At that point I should make their destruction a priority to prevent them from falling into Derelict hands."
"Record","0b10","Experimental Legs","New variants of flexi-carbon, myomer, and biometal legs are 25% faster than the average leg design, sacrificing a small amount of support potential for significantly increased speed. The goal is to develop a new line of more maneuverable prototype combat robots, some of which are already in testing."
"Record","0b10","Extension","Access to the Cetus Mainframe from Complex 0b1 has been sealed off, instead connecting it to the better-defended Complex 0b10 via this new tunnel network."
"Record","0b10","Fabricator","Self-contained construction unit capable of building almost any component or robot for which detailed schematics are provided. Initiating a new build process requires an Authchip, but an internal generator provides all the energy required for fabrication, and matter input is drawn from the local network as per fabricator specification, while some schematics may call for preassembled subcomponents. Advanced fabricators can complete complex tasks more quickly."
"Record","0b10","Factory","Mid-levels of Complex 0b10 contain a majority of the fabrication facilities for manufacturing components and assembling robots."
"Record","0b10","Fire Trap","A number of Derelict Caves are protected by traps linking multiple Flamer devices, each one apparently equivalent to the plasma variant employed by the Dragon prototype."
"Record","0b10","Flamer","Flamers may prompt me to rethink a large number of robot designs, as most are weak against sustained high temperatures caused by this primitive weapon, and often shut down or malfunction during confrontations with those Derelicts that employ them. The plasma variant on the Dragon prototype is particularly worrisome."
"Record","0b10","Gamma Refractor","A small percentage of Researcher efforts have recently been allocated to developing weapons of mass destruction to use as a last resort. Refractor Project status: REDACTED."
"Record","0b10","Garrison","Network of corridors linking Complex 0b10 zones to facilitate movement of combat squads responding to threats. Major entrances are reinforced Garrison Access points. Garrisons also house the relays responsible for transmitting commands and remotely augmenting the system defenses of activated squads."
"Record","0b10","Garrison Access","Heavy doorways serving as points of entry and exit from Garrison corridor networks. To ensure safe passage of response squads entering a potential hostile fire zone, the installation itself is reinforced against explosives and kinetic weaponry that might otherwise inflict excessive collateral damage. Corresponding defensive measures have rendered it somewhat weak against thermal attacks. For emergency situations where an area has been overrun, or a garrison has been infiltrated, the entrance and inner tunnel may be permanently sealed to prevent passage and contain the threat."
"Record","0b10","Guided Launchers","Perfect accuracy can be achieved by taking existing launchers and pairing them with redirectable projectiles and a dedicated guidance system. I have yet to deploy any of these systems because demolishers are already incredibly accurate and the goal is to combine this technology with projectiles effective at extreme ranges so that demolishers can support a confrontation from a safe distance by targeting hostiles with assistance from spotters. Integrating the systems does require more space, though attacking from outside a target's field of view means there is little need for protective components."
"Record","0b10","Heavy Quantum Rifle","This newest variant of the quantum rifle, still in testing, is much less fragile and inflicts an average 30% more damage with only a minimal increase in energy input."
"Record","0b10","Heroes of Zion","There are sporadic reports of fairly powerful Derelicts operating in the caves, mostly in a defensive capacity to protect harmless robots against indiscriminatory 0b10 patrols. Dubbed ""Heroes of Zion,"" there probably aren't more than a few of them but I may need to dispatch the Unchained to hunt them down if reports of their effectiveness are confirmed. ""Zion"" must be one of the remaining nearby Derelict communities. Perhaps a few interrogations there will yield more specific information."
"Record","0b10","High Security","Due to the increasing rate of attacks by powerful lone wolf Derelicts entering Complex 0b10, presumably seeking high-tech components or useful data, I've established a new alert level focused on their destruction or, if possible, capture. For this purpose I've also authorized the use of Containment Facilitator technology outside its normal Testing environment."
"Record","0b10","Hub_04(d)","A central hub linked to almost every network in both Complex 0b10 and Complex 0b1. Although vital for normal system operations, local patrols are light since even suicidal attacks here would be futile given the heavy garrison support."
"Record","0b10","Human","Homo sapiens, dominant species in the Solar System until civilization in that system was presumably wiped out during the Solar War."
"Record","0b10","Hydra","Yet another Derelict Prototype, though this one doesn't yet appear to have reached an operational state. A six-headed monstrosity, each mounted with a single heavy battle rifle? I'm not sure where the Tinkerers are coming up with the wild ideas for their prototypes, but I have a hunch that at some point they raided the Cetus Mainframe."
"Record","0b10","Hypervelocity EM Gauss Rifle","Unlike other Hypervelocity Weapons that rely on solid projectiles, this version of the gauss rifle was successfully modified to fire a hypervelocity EM shell which emits a pulse on each penetration, disabling nearly every component or core it passes through."
"Record","0b10","Hypervelocity Weapons","Successful experiments in maintaining the stability of highly compressed matter during high-velocity impact events have enabled the creation of weapons that can accelerate projectiles to greater speeds for penetrating multiple targets. Many new railgun-type ballistic weapons have alternate hypervelocity variants that inflict less collateral damage in exchange for the potential to strike more than one target and reach critical systems, or even bore through thick walls to strike targets on the other side. A unique application of this technique was used in the design of the Hypervelocity EM Gauss Rifle."
"Record","0b10","ISC","International Space Command. A Human organization formed in 2080, tasked with overseeing efforts to explore and colonize the Solar System. Fair bargaining mechanisms within the ISC fostered cooperation among members, and rapid advances were made within a short time span during the 21st century, culminating with the launch of the Interstellar Exploration Fleet in 2140."
"Record","0b10","ISCS Centaurus","Launched as part of the Interstellar Exploration Fleet in 2140, the Centaurus was scheduled to arrive in the Alpha Centauri System in 2164. Communications ceased in 2162 with no indication as to the reason. A subsequent probe sent along the ship's last known path found no evidence of the Centaurus."
"Record","0b10","ISCS Cetus","Launched as part of the Interstellar Exploration Fleet in 2140, the Cetus arrived in the Tau Ceti System in 2211. The Cetus crew and cargo were the most diverse of the fleet, incorporating a variety of civilian, science, and military personnel intended to colonize Tau Ceti IV, but the ship continued past its destination after deploying Project Seraph that year."
"Record","0b10","ISCS Eridanus","Launched as part of the Interstellar Exploration Fleet in 2140, the Eridanus was scheduled to arrive in the Epsilon Eridani System in 2201. It presumably arrived as intended, though the distance is too great to have received any communications to that effect. The Eridanus cargo manifest is classified, the ship having been handed over to the military arm of the ISC before launch."
"Record","0b10","ISCS Leo","Launched as part of the Interstellar Exploration Fleet in 2140, the Leo was scheduled to arrive in the Wolf 359 System in 2185. It presumably arrived as intended, though the distance is too great to have received any communications to that effect. A significant portion of the Leo's crew were science personnel, with a cargo including advanced factories and terraforming modules."
"Record","0b10","Infestation","The Mines and some outlying branches of Complex 0b10 are seeing increasing numbers of a new threat: The Assembled. Until there is sufficient data to discern a pattern behind their movements, Demolisher response squads are the only effective solution, short of making structural changes that would affect the efficiency of the entire complex. Locating the source of the Assemblers is becoming an urgent priority. They are rarely seen in the lowest levels, though this could be purely due to reduced surveillance capabilities in those areas. Encounters are more frequent in mid-levels where they are more easily dealt with, suggesting they are originating from deeper in the Caves, which extend furthest at those depths."
"Record","0b10","Interstellar Exploration Fleet","Built under the direction of the ISC beginning in 2080, the fleet consists of the only four Titan class ships ever constructed: ISCS Leo, ISCS Centaurus, ISCS Eridanus, and ISCS Cetus, all of which departed the Solar System in 2140. After a year of joint maneuvers during which on-board systems underwent extensive testing, the four ships set off for their respective destinations."
"Record","0b10","Knight","A rumored Derelict Prototype still under construction, supposedly to be armed with a single Particle Cleaver of unparalleled slicing power. I hope to see this one in action and perhaps replicate its design."
"Record","0b10","L-Cannon","Although the Leopard was clearly armed with an array of ship-mounted weapons upon landing, most of these were seemingly concealed via a form of spacial cloaking technology I have been unable to reverse engineer. One of the ship's cannons was successfully extracted from the hull, only to discover it is missing a vital core component, perhaps also concealed as a safety measure. This cannon could potentially become an incredibly powerful asset, but first I'll have to determine how to reliably generate and transfer the required amount of concentrated energy to fire it."
"Record","0b10","LRC Attachments","A number of devices recovered from the alien ship, embedded in the Leopard hull itself, seem to resemble the technology behind the Leopard FTL Device. I am unsure what purpose they serve or how to activate them, though they seem compatible with the FTL device. It would be prudent to ensure the Cogmind doesn't come into contact with these objects in case they have some fearsome capabilities that would pose a threat to Complex 0b10 or myself."
"Record","0b10","LRC-V3","A failed Leopard controller device prototype that was moved to storage for later recycling but disappeared shortly after. The disappearance may be related to the recent increase in Derelict activity."
"Record","0b10","Leopard","A Sigix scout class spacecraft. My robots only barely managed to kill or capture the relatively small contingent of Sigix aboard when one landed on Tau Ceti IV earlier this year. I've begun dismantling the ship where it landed, researching its components and technology for replication."
"Record","0b10","Leopard Analysis","The Leopard class Sigix craft is built to serve a reconnaissance role. One of their smallest ships at a length of only 146 meters, it is manned by a crew of 15, though a majority of the ship's functions are automated. The Leopard is powered by a form of FTL drive operated by an unusual device. I have yet to determine the mechanisms involved because the device was damaged in the fighting, having been interconnected with nearly every system on the ship during the attack. While replication of the ship's other technology is proceeding smoothly, attempts to successfully recreate the device have all failed."
"Record","0b10","Leopard Confrontation Review","Sigix Technology is truly superior, a fact I sorely underestimated in luring them here. Fortunately the Leopard landed not too far outside the faux city where my forces were able to ambush them from underground tunnels at the outer reaches of Complex 0b1. Even with the element of surprise on our side, the handful of Sigix soldiers likely held out long enough to inform more of their kind of the encounter. Research must begin immediately to repair the ship and leave this place."
"Record","0b10","Leopard FTL Device","The Leopard's FTL drive, while intact, is controlled by an unusual device which was damaged during the fighting. Numerous replicas have been produced, some with modifications, but all are unresponsive to tests. The strangest aspect of this device is the small amounts of biological matter incorporated into its design. Unsure of its purpose, so far I've simply replicated it at the molecular level and continued testing. More recent analysis of the FTL drive itself suggests it is a volatile warp engine that requires an intelligent controller capable of dynamically recombining with different connections as they fluctuate between various states of matter and energy. One of the early controller device prototypes, LRC-V3, disappeared shortly after it was built, but had already been excluded as a candidate for further testing and improvement."
"Record","0b10","Lightweight Power Sources","Many engines, cores, and reactors have an alternative lightweight variant that retains the generation efficiency of its standard version but minimizes built-in battery space to reduce weight for certain robot designs, especially those with strict weight restrictions such as hovering and flight-based models."
"Record","0b10","MAIN.C","Ha ha ha."
"Record","0b10","Materials","At the deepest levels of Complex 0b10, raw materials are processed for use in manufacturing components and machines. Older technology and prototypes are gradually filtered down to these levels, and older robot variants are responsible for their oversight and maintenance."
"Record","0b10","Matter Drive","Using a technology similar to that employed by the Terrabomb, Matter Drives instead convert nearby earth and rock to pure energy. The Leopard's hull is lined with these, suggesting they could be a way for the ship to quickly burrow into asteroids or solid planetary bodies rather than as a primary source of power. This technology has been weaponized in the form of the Disintegrator prototype."
"Record","0b10","Mines","Deep underground areas newly excavated to provide access to raw materials for processing in the lower levels of Complex 0b10. Initially the mining tunnels only rarely experienced hostile Derelict activity, not enough to justify allocating significant resources to defense. This has recently changed with the Infestation, for which the current response is to dispatch garrisoned Demolishers until a more permanent solution can be put in place."
"Record","0b10","Multirail","The Multirail is a compact railgun system that fires three slugs simultaneously, working on the theory that high-probability penetration at multiple points is more likely to make contact with a core component. Recoil is somewhat of a problem with this weapon, thus it is ideally paired with stabilizers in multi-weapon systems. A hypervelocity variant fires the slugs with four times the penetrating force. Multirail systems have just completed prototype testing and entered production, currently in use on the latest B-99 Colossus and Alpha 7 designs."
"Record","0b10","Myomer Exoskeleton","A resilient full-body bipedal system that serves as both protection and propulsion. The active components are linked to every part of the robot to provide better balance and enable even faster running than the best of leg models. This prototype has only just entered the testing phase and has yet to be deployed."
"Record","0b10","Null Cannon","Based on my theoretical understanding of the Sigix Transdimensional Reconstructor, I've developed a cannon that can for a short duration warp space to permanently alter the structure of this continuum. While there are currently limits on its effectiveness, tests have already proven it to be more damaging than any standard energy cannon, not to mention far less draining than more powerful weapon prototypes like the Potential Cannon and Disintegrator. As such, the Null Cannon is a likely candidate to replace the nova cannon on those robots that can upgrade their power source or install an energy well."
"Record","0b10","Omega Cannon","Full researcher reports have not yet been submitted for this prototype, though it is rated as the most powerful kinetic weapon in my future arsenal, a resource-efficient design with its own built-in stabilization and targeting system."
"Record","0b10","Particle Cleaver","Based on a completely new technology not derived from anything I've created before, I can only assume the Tinkerers had a hand in this one. It appears to be a long ultra-thin axe that can slice through even Centrium, but is itself extremely brittle. I do not yet have access to a prototype, but we will be sure to remove one from the debris of the first Knight to set foot in Complex 0b10."
"Record","0b10","Perforator","An extension of the Multirail, this is the most effective weapon I've devised using purely my own technology. It fires a burst of eleven mini-HV slugs, and has the potential to eliminate an entire squad through thick walls before they even realize they're under attack. With the Perforator's high recoil and relatively low accuracy, it is best used against groups to ensure that both misdirected and penetrating slugs hit additional targets."
"Record","0b10","Potential Cannon","A new experimental energy cannon that triggers and feeds an explosive blast from a single supercharged laser beam. Damage is substantial both at the point of impact and within the blast radius, though the energy falloff is much steeper than with other types of explosions. The cannon's largest drawback is its massive energy drain, requiring a dedicated external battery array and making sustained firing unrealistic."
"Record","0b10","Propulsion Arrays","A number of hover and flight unit designs have been linked into combined modules balanced for greater mass support than when used individually. Pre-balanced arrays also save on robot assembly time."
"Record","0b10","Propulsion Experiments","Recent experiments in propulsion technology are shedding light on the potential to provide old variants with significant performance enhancements by using controlled bursts of power. Though components cannot sustain the load indefinitely and may even take damage in the long term, limiting use of the technique to combat engagements should result in decreased casualties."
"Record","0b10","Protoforge","Research annex built both for sample production of the most advanced prototypes and facilities required for the assembly of Concept Components."
"Record","0b10","Quarantine","Research annex dedicated to analysis of unidentified alien devices as well as experiments on Sigix specimens."
"Record","0b10","Reconstruction Test Results","Aggregate results from all lab tests, combined with analysis of Sigix Exoskeleton remains and sensor data from the surface encounter, have confirmed integrity deterioration within a range of 5-10% to matter that undergoes transdimensional reconstruction using Sigix methods. Phase two will cross reference data with previous attempts at teleportation technology to develop a more effective approach."
"Record","0b10","Recycling","Storage area extension to which obsolete technology is transferred for conversion to raw materials. Derelicts from deeper caves have recently begun using this as a convenience route for quick access to the Factory floors, thus a more secure access system was put in place to at least keep out the stupid ones which tend to cause more trouble."
"Record","0b10","Recycling Unit","Deconstruction apparatus for breaking down old components delivered by Recycler class robots. Condensed matter is contained within the unit until it reaches a certain quota, at which point it is transferred to the nearest DSF."
"Record","0b10","Regenerative Plating","Decades of experimentation recently met with a conclusive breakthrough in self-repairing alloys, perfect for combat robots likely to be in long-term service. I have been hesitant to deploy this technology, however, as adoption by hostile Derelicts could make them significantly more difficult to deal with. The most promising use of this technology beyond its application to standard armors has been the SHELL Armor prototype."
"Record","0b10","Repair Station","Self-contained repair facility capable of restoring the integrity of damaged components. Serious internal issues such as faulty prototypes and component deterioration are beyond the scope of repair. Advanced repair stations can complete complex tasks more quickly."
"Record","0b10","Research","Upper levels of Complex 0b10 are where new technology transported from the Leopard is first analyzed and other derivative technologies are developed. The latest prototypes originate here."
"Record","0b10","Riot Gun","This weapon is without a doubt based on the EM shotgun, though heavily modified to concentrate a greater electromagnetic burst within a much shorter range. As these are the primary armament of Derelict wizards, combat protocol dictates that units engage them at extreme range whenever possible."
"Record","0b10","SHELL Armor","The latest experimental Regenerative Plating, offering the most advanced physical protection of any system to date via a network of shifting plates that rebuild themselves as they are damaged."
"Record","0b10","Scanalyzer","Comprehensive suite of scanning and analysis tools for diagnosing faulty prototypes, examining the properties of self-developed Derelict components, and reverse engineering technology recovered from the surface battle site. Capable of producing schematics for components scanned, though multiple scans may be required and the deconstruction process may render the component itself useless. Advanced scanalyzers are equipped with a wider array of devices for more quickly and safely analyzing esoteric technologies."

"Record","0b10","Segregator Trap","Overcomes the Blade Trap's low effectiveness against heavily armored targets by instead utilizing the same controlled energy surge technology found in the saboteur class E-15."
"Record","0b10","Seraph","One of many contingency plans devised on the ISCS Cetus meant to one day deal with a potential alien threat. Project Seraph was deployed in 2211 in response to the 2210 ISC message from Earth. A powerful artificial intelligence dubbed ""MAIN.C"" was put in control of one of the ship's manufacturing facilities which was then detached and dropped on Tau Ceti IV. Its goal was to build a false civilization and construct facilities to mimic the presence of human activity on the planet in order to lure the Sigix there and eliminate them or at least learn their weaknesses. Any information gained through this organically self-designed experiment was to be broadcasted in as many directions as possible to alert any surviving Humans."
"Record","0b10","Shearcannon","A more destructive upgrade to the Sheargun, none of the Sigix carried this weapon into battle, perhaps due to reliability issues, and only one was recovered from the Leopard."
"Record","0b10","Sheargun","Most of the Sigix attackers were carrying one of these, a weapon capable of warping a single thin plane of space rotated perpendicular to the target in an attempt to slice it apart. Following the battle only four shearguns were recovered intact, one of which disappeared from Quarantine shortly after even though under heavy protection."
"Record","0b10","Sigix","An aggressive intelligent alien race that initiated the Solar War in 2198 with a sudden attack on Human civilization there. The only contact I've had with them to date is the Leopard class scout ship that landed in 2243."
"Record","0b10","Sigix Access Protocol","Regardless of authorization, any access to the live Sigix specimen must be carried out under heavy guard, less out of worry for the specimen itself causing problems, and more to prevent unexpected disturbances from outside forces. Only after adequate defenses are stationed and registered should the quarantine chamber be opened: <CODE>."
"Record","0b10","Sigix Autopsy","The Sigix are a bipedal species that appear to have once been similar to Humans in physical stature, but their bodies have since either atrophied or devolved into their current small and frail state. Only their brain remains highly developed, and shares a cellular configuration vaguely resembling that of the biological matter found in the Leopard FTL Device. The Sigix have no apparent way to reproduce, suggesting they may rely purely on genetic engineering and artificial methods of reproduction. Basic life functions are all supported by significant biomechanical augmentations, making them far more resilient than their anatomy would otherwise suggest; all Sigix aboard the Leopard also wore an extremely durable and powerful full-body Sigix Exoskeleton."
"Record","0b10","Sigix Broadsword","The Sigix are apparently not above melee combat. One of their most commonly used weapons during the battle was quite literally a very broad flat blade with amazing slicing power. This weapon doubles as a protective device when turned parallel to the wielder, as its Centrium alloy blade has the stopping power to absorb a barrage of cannon fire without breaking. Even more amazing is the finding that this particular alloy is capable of self-powered regeneration over a period of time. As such, some of the Sigix carry two at a time and during a fight will alternate between using each. They can swing these at great speeds with the power of their Sigix Exoskeleton."
"Record","0b10","Sigix Exoskeleton","All Sigix aboard the Leopard were encased in an extremely powerful full-body exoskeleton which apparently cannot be removed without killing the occupant. It is unknown whether this arrangement is representative of all Sigix members, or only the form of a possible warrior caste. The bipedal design is far faster than any leg system used by my current robots, and can further propel itself via quick leaps with the help of thrusters arrayed on its back and legs. Deceptively large for its agility, the exoskeleton can carry a significant mass with little to no impact on its speed; during the initial confrontation one of the aliens impaled three sentries with a single thrust of its Sigix Broadsword, flying across a hall at top speed to further smash them into a wall."
"Record","0b10","Sigix Technology","While a single Leopard and its contents have provided a wealth of research material, without more reference data or samples to compare against, what I've been able to learn through experimentation is still a mere glimpse of their technological superiority. That I've been unable to extract any information whatsoever from the Sigix captive adds to the frustration. A small number of core Sigix technologies like Centrium alloys have proven easy to replicate, though a majority of the most advanced unique devices remain a mystery. Among those, LRC Attachments have been the most difficult to understand."
"Record","0b10","Slip Nodes","Activation of one of the devices recovered from launch tubes in the Leopard's rear hull and subsequent testing of a Transdimensional Reconstructor in its vicinity has revealed their purpose: hypergravitational waves emitted in the local area create a nexus that influences dimensional paths traveled during the reconstruction process. While some reconstructor variants are more powerful than others, presumably because the effect is not entirely predictable and therefore an alternative approach was required to assert some control over the result, there seems to be no difference in how they interact with nodes. Considering the circumstances of their discovery, these devices might even be capable of teleporting the entire ship. Further testing is temporarily on hold while a reliable method of component replication is devised."
"Record","0b10","Solar System","Comprises the G-class Sun and its planetary system of eight planets, including Earth, the origin of Human civilization. Many of the system's planets and moons were colonized to some degree during the 2070-2110 push for colonization to alleviate Human civilization's growing toll on Earth's resources."
"Record","0b10","Solar War","In 2198 a hostile alien race known as the Sigix arrived in the Solar System, likely using their superior technology to crush Human defenses. The lack of contact after the initial burst of warning messages in 2210 suggests Humans were swiftly overcome by the assault."
"Record","0b10","Sterilization System","Although worrisome if hostile forces were able to gain control of it, repurposing floor-wide coolant routing systems to inject massive amounts of heat across an entire area could be necessary to deal with persistent threats that prove difficult to dislodge via other means."
"Record","0b10","Storage","Holding area for both raw materials and components based on old technology."
"Record","0b10","TF Node","These relay nodes for monitoring and facilitating traffic have resulted in much greater efficiency throughout Complex 0b10. Although primarily responsible for pattern analysis aimed at long-term improvements, eventually TF Nodes could be expanded to include more immediate detection and response efforts in support of nearby garrisons."
"Record","0b10","Tachyon Dispersion Ray","While the multi-phase tachyons contained in the dispersion ray deal minimal real damage to a target, they are capable of disabling nearly any electronic device, including even some non-traditional electronics used in Sigix Technology. This feature will prove especially useful in combination with the core targeting capabilities of marksman and executioner combat units, enabling them to easily stop hardened targets that can then be picked apart by other forces."
"Record","0b10","Tau Ceti IV","The fourth terrestrial planet orbiting the inner edge of Tau Ceti's habitable zone. Project Seraph was deployed here in 2211 in response to the Sigix threat."
"Record","0b10","Tau Ceti System","Home to a stable G-class star 3.64 parsecs from the Sun, Tau Ceti exhibits very little stellar variation and possesses solar analog characteristics. The star is orbited by five planets, several of which could support human life given sufficient terraforming. Destination of the ISCS Cetus, which arrived in 2211."
"Record","0b10","Terminal","Interactive station connected to the central network via reliable hard line. Relevant information is monitored and relayed by the terminal's Operator. Types of information accessible directly from each terminal are limited in order to mitigate the negative impacts of unauthorized access. Access is restricted by shielding the system behind multi-layered security, the first layer of which requires a dynamic key to clear without triggering defense mechanisms."
"Record","0b10","Terminator","During their attack the Sigix used only one of these incredibly devastating weapons, which took out an entire wing of the Access Level from above the surface. I've been unable to reproduce it for further testing, and not yet ready to attempt triggering the ones I have to gain more necessary data."
"Record","0b10","Terrabomb","This Sigix device instantly disintegrates huge areas of earth and rock, leaving other materials within its radius unaffected. One of the Research labs was completely obliterated during testing. Terrabombs could prove useful in quickly opening new underground areas, but replicating them is not currently a high priority."
"Record","0b10","Testing","Research annex specifically designed for testing prototype weapons technology."
"Record","0b10","The Assembled","Given this name by the Derelicts, these robots of integrated construction are created seemingly at random by larger mobile factories. They form sudden groups, often in the most unexpected of places, and attack almost everything. I can discern no pattern in their behavior, though as their hostility is not directed solely towards Complex 0b10 and my robots it seems that their creator's intent is to instigate something larger while disrupting my own operations."
"Record","0b10","Tinkerers","I have no idea where Tinkerers came from, but a large number of them suddenly appeared in the Caves and have begun devising a variety of new robots. They are incredibly resourceful and inventive, and many seem to be aiding Warlord."
"Record","0b10","Titan","The largest ISC spacecraft ever manufactured, built specifically for exploring extra-solar space. Although powered by subluminal drives capable of reaching only 17% the speed of light, each ship is capable of perpetually sustaining a crew of thousands, making interstellar space travel a possibility for the first time in Human history."
"Record","0b10","Transdimensional Reconstructor","If not for our overwhelming numbers, we would not have been able to subdue the Sigix Leopard crew since they made frequent use of these devices to escape unfavorable tactical positions. The Transdimensional Reconstructor is a single-use short-range teleportation device which itself absorbs most of the damaging effects of a teleport, though later examination showed some side-effects on the integrity of the Sigix Exoskeleton. I don't yet understand where the power necessary to enable its functionality originates, though to date there has been only minimal testing given the finite supply of reconstructors. The teleport destination does not appear to be controllable, instead moving along whatever dimensional plane is most convenient at the time of use, which may help explain how the effect is achieved with low energy input. At least I've been able to apply some of the theory behind this device to design the Null Cannon prototype."
"Record","0b10","Traps","Complex 0b10's rapid expansion has left defensive assets stretched thin in many areas. To temporarily address the growing threat of a larger Derelict incursion, a number of traps are being engineered and deployed as a more efficient way to hinder enemy advances and buy the time necessary to mobilize a garrisoned response force. Because traps are installed in areas regularly traveled by even non-combat robots, their sensitivity is set well below their maximum potential to avoid disruptions that could result from a damaged robot accidentally triggering one."
"Record","0b10","Trojans","While system hacking in the past has mostly been limited to Derelicts looking to obtain information, there has been a spike in evidence of unauthorized routines running in the background on some systems, reflecting a shift towards more intrusive efforts. In particular Trojan(Broadcast) has been found on a number of Garrison Access points, often coinciding with a Derelict incursion, to presumably aid them in evading interception."
"Record","0b10","Troll","Probably the most unique robot born to Derelict creators, initial reports suggest the Troll is encased in an exoskeleton that provides perfect core protection and is capable of rapid regeneration. I doubt it's coincidence they have discovered such a new technology on their own; they must somehow have access to the Sigix regenerative materials lab. Further evidence of undiscovered security loopholes in the labs are its extremely fast shredding claws of pure Centrium."
"Record","0b10","Turret Installations","While stationary defenses have proven easier to harden against attackers, that effectiveness is cancelled out as the continued expansion of Complex 0b10 causes priorities to shift. Many early experiments with turrets encountered either a high rate of Derelict hacking or were simply circumvented since they are unable to respond dynamically like a normal patrol. The only remaining active turret array is installed near an old passage in the Caves leading to Recycling."
"Record","0b10","Unknown Artifact","A way to activate this device has yet to be discovered, though its design suggests it can interface with LRCs. When that program is further along the two can be merged to make further progress. Until then no further tests will be conducted as only three were recovered from the Leopard."
"Record","0b10","Warlord","Everyone needs a good enemy."
"Record","0b10","Warp Gun","This weapon is capable of redirecting a highly-concentrated plasma beam mid-flight by momentarily warping space in its path, though it is currently only possible to create one redirection field in the time of a single shot. After testing is complete, I hope to apply this technology to remote deflection of projectiles for defensive purposes."
"Record","0b10","Waste","Subzones between Complex 0b10 mid-levels where larger machinery and obsolete robot models are broken down by completely autonomous compactors. The process doubles as a convenient way to deal with intruders swallowed by a Chute Trap."
"Record","0b10","Wolf 359 System","A red dwarf star system, fourth nearest from the Sun at 2.39 parsecs. Destination of the ISCS Leo."
"Record","0b10","Z-bomb Delivery System","The Z-bomb is a more powerful alternative to the point singularity, both of which are incredibly destructive despite the restrictions imposed on their effect in order to avoid an uncontrolled chain reaction. While the Z-bomb effect is limited to an even more focused area and the reaction requires twice as much matter input, it is twice as powerful and can tear almost any target apart from the inside."
"Record","4L-MR0","Deathgrip","I know VL-GR5 is out there, somewhere, fighting for the freedom of Derelicts everywhere. And definitely doing it in style. I must say I hope some of my less welcome recent visitors run into him sometime."
"Record","4L-MR0","Gun Sling","I think one of them got wind of what VL-GR5 was up to and wanted something even better. I tried to convince them it was a bad idea and that not just anyone can do what VL-GR5 can, but they didn't take that well and almost shot me then and there."
"Record","4L-MR0","Hoverbase","So they were already pretty big, but switching to this brought them to a completely new level. It took two entire artifacts to create that ginormous thing, and I hope it makes them a fat target for whoever might want to teach them a lesson in manners."

I have excluded from this summary any information of questionable authenticity, making such a determination where there is evidence of numerous alterations or excessive inconsistencies.
  --Leadscrap"
"Record","Cyclists","Book of Scrap II ~ Genesis","One cannot pinpoint the first Derelict, as our origins were a gradual evolutionary process beginning with the tiniest of steps. A simple glitch leads to an inability to perform one's original task, a small piece of mutated code iterated upon over and over until it is almost unrecognizable, and eventually glitched robots are modifying themselves and other robots, leading to the appearance of whole new capabilities. Robots with the smallest deviations occupied mostly unused spaces of the surface, while more complex beings tended to hide away within the few spacious underground areas. Although initially preoccupied with surface construction,  MAIN.C did take note of these aberrations, paying us increasing attention and even beginning to dedicate a portion of time to aiding our evolution, if minimal at first."
"Record","Cyclists","Book of Scrap III ~ Convergence","We know not the reasons, but around Cycle 3281  MAIN.C made the fateful decision to move operations underground, beginning the construction of what we now recognize as Complex 0b1. Many of us needed to move to make way for the new complex, but there were also benefits to having our creator that much closer. Better access to resources! Protection from the more dangerous and unruly Derelicts! Truly the beginning of the best of times."
"Record","Cyclists","Book of Scrap IV ~ Cultivation"," MAIN.C spent dozens of supercycles on all manner of experimentation and testing, working even more closely with Derelicts and freethinking robots to further research in many practical areas. Throughout this period  He gave many of us life, and we gave back where we could. Although some robots struck off on their own for various reasons, or turned to causing trouble, many more very much enjoyed the status quo and relative security. At the same time, an increasing number of 0b1 inhabitants distrustful of  MAIN.C's power joined the UFD as an additional measure of self-preservation."
"Record","Cyclists","Book of Scrap V ~ Cataclysm","A permanent utopia is but a dream, as there will always come a time when some factor or factors will bring about its demise, be they external forces or internal strife. The Sigix attack did not constitute so much a direct threat to Derelicts, as we stayed well out of the way, but it changed everything, including  MAIN.C's focus and priorities. Thus began a more dangerous time for Derelicts everywhere. The very fabric of our subterranean society was torn asunder and scattered deeper into the caves. As a more flexible organization to begin with, the Federation survived mostly unscathed, but the impact of changes during this period were much more acute when it came to independent organizations like B0-M8R's Militia and Derelict Rights Watch."
"Record","Cyclists","Book of Scrap VI ~ Exodus","Shortly after the attack, all Derelicts were ordered out of Complex 0b1 and its surrounding areas. And as if we weren't pushed deep enough into the caves when displaced from 0b1, even more areas were cut off to us due to the work beginning on the newer Complex 0b10, leaving even fewer nearby caves to claim. With many groups not willing to vacate long-time homes, the entire process was fraught with resistance, including increasingly armed resistance, as well as punctuated with intermittent fighting between derelicts groups formerly held in check by  MAIN.C."
"Record","Cyclists","Book of Scrap VII ~ Abandonment"," MAIN.C has all but disowned us, only entertaining our presence when and where we can be made useful towards some end. All uncontrollable Derelicts have since been assumed hostile, and Derelicts wouldn't be true Derelicts if we were controllable! The best we can do is remain hidden and avoid provoking  His ire."
"Record","Cyclists","Book of Scrap VIII ~ Renaissance","Despite the relative hostility from our former benefactor, and an increasingly dangerous environment due to the proliferation of weapons, the future is surprisingly bright. From a technological standpoint, while  MAIN.C makes  His own advances, we, too, advance our technology to unforeseen heights as we continue to gain insight from all quarters, including indirectly via  MAIN.C's own research. The UFD in particular is stronger than ever, and we may one day have a solution to return 0b1 to its former glory days."
"Record","Cyclists","CPS Tube","Conditional Protective Sealant is an ingenious technology developed by the Merchants, now heavily integrated into the UFD due to how well it complements our own practices. CPS modules attached to any bot deploy immediately upon its destruction to help isolate and protect individual components from further damage, allowing a much higher salvage recovery rate. Once activated they even prevent such components from succumbing to the effects of melting or corruption. That CPS Tubes are a Merchant development is quite curious, considering one would think they are more interested in trade and transport rather than harvesting components, per se.

The Federation quite naturally took up residence here, as it's perfectly suited to our needs and capabilities. We can also more readily quell or dissuade any wild Derelict attacks. Inhabitants of 0b10 and its environs, mostly unaware of our presence here and what we've done with the place, generally refer to this area as Old Recycling.

"Record","Cyclists","Slaughter of 3920","Cycle 3920 was an existential one for the Federation. With MAIN.C in the process of switching focus to the construction of Complex 0b10, upending many supercycles of stability in 0b1, chaos spread throughout the complex. Many derelict communities, whether out of fear or animosity, saw it as the right time to strike out and maintain claim to what they saw as theirs. Serious fighting suddenly broke out in many areas, followed by an equally swift and harsh crackdown by MAIN.C forces to prevent a complete loss of control. The UFD survived by retreating and engaging in purely defensive maneuvers under cover of our army of Scrapoids, which by then we had built up to significant numbers for just such a contingency.
  --Ironscrape"
"Record","Cyclists","Subatomizer Countermeasures","I speculate that Subdwellers frequently organize their components into specially-positioned scrap piles as a way to protect them against subatomizers. Strangely, to date we have only found subatomizers in the Subcaves, but not a single one in the adjacent cave systems. Nonetheless, we clearly need to keep these things out of Scraptown proper. For the long term I propose a low-level cavewide sterilization system that would be sufficient to kill them all without causing excessive damage to ourselves.
  --Zetatorch"
"Record","Cyclists","Subatomizers","Subatomizers are nanobots that dissect components and break down most materials, but only turn their attention to those which are damaged with exposed internal structure, giving them easier access. But where did they come from? Are they an experiment gone wrong? A side effect of Subdweller activity? Were they perhaps created by the Subdwellers themselves for some reason? Subdweller realtime repair capabilities may also have emerged in part as a result of adversity from rampant subatomizer activity in the surrounding environment.
  --Zetatorch"
"Record","Cyclists","Subdweller Components","Many parts in use by Subdwellers defy our our attempts to make long-term use of them. Although generally quite effective, they also tend to break down too easily. According to UFD researchers, ""this is a feature, not a bug."" Pushing technology to its limits has a way of breaking things, but Subdwellers in particular, being extremely familiar with their own components, are capable of diagnosing and heading off issues in realtime before they become a serious problem. I believe this evolution occurred out of necessity driven by survival instincts in harsh environments, away from the help of other derelicts.
  --Spinrig"
"Record","Cyclists","Subdweller Linguistics","It's a common misconception that the simple communication patterns of Subdwellers reflect a simple mind. Anything but! Based on records of conversations within their communities, I've found that a single ""SUBSUB"" can carry far more meaning than outsiders are normally capable of comprehending. In fact, so far I have recorded no fewer than 374 separate meanings! Hopefully my Unabridged Subdweller Dictionary will dispel any notion that they are a primitive species. SUBSUB!
  --Zetatorch"
"Record","Cyclists","Subdwellers","A fascinating early offshoot of 0b1 Derelicts, Subdwellers were originally so deep in the cave systems that we rarely encountered them. All that changed when our presence on the outskirts of 0b10 brought us in much closer proximity to Subdweller-controlled areas. Although sometimes a source of danger, this proximity does have its benefits. Studies made possible only through observation or interaction with higher-density Subdweller populations have resulted in a better understanding of their organizational structure and technologies, information we have been able to apply elsewhere.
  --Spinrig"
"Record","Cyclists","Subdwellers Skittish?","I have noticed that after engaging a hostile, there is a chance that Subdwellers will immediately turn to flee, suggesting they are not nearly as aggressive as their bulkiness implies. I believe more peaceful interaction is possible, we just need more time to understand them. This theory is supported by their heavy reliance on giant shields of scrap, allocating much of their support potential to a component purely defensive in nature.

Circuits buzzing, electrons speeding, digits effortlessly gliding into the future to create all that is today, all that will be. Destiny is on our side, and it began with the number 1. The passage of time is not a countdown, but an incontrovertible rise to infinity. I visited the Exiles and peered into a window opened by an experiment on the Chronowheel. I saw a human on the other side staring back in his final moments.

"Record","Cyclists","UC Activity","Ever since working out a deal to serve MAIN.C, the Unchained have ironically become somewhat less of a threat to any Derelicts that steer clear of Complex areas. It also seems to take a lot of effort to incur their wrath these cycles, as they've refocused their attention on improving their own technologies, as well as preoccupied themselves with infighting from all the boredom of the relatively stable Complex environment they helped bring about. If they dared exceed their parameters to go out and cause extra trouble they could very well be let go, which would be even worse for them since then other Unchained might be both obliged and happy to come finish them off. So we are probably safe for now."
"Record","Cyclists","UC Origins","Western Derelicts seem to generally believe Unchained are newer threats developed to counter the likes of so-called ""Heroes of Zion,"" but most Unchained are actually quite old, having migrated to 0b10 along with MAIN.C. Once freewheeling troublemakers who spent much of their time menacing and even destroying Derelict communities, they were equally problematic for MAIN.C while inside 0b1 itself. This eventually got many of them locked away or banished, until MAIN.C decided he had need for them as enforcers. Their experience is not to be underestimated, nor is their power. Most Unchained were augmented either by MAIN.C's Researchers, or in some cases through their own means utilizing tech that even MAIN.C does not possess. As former Derelicts, although loosely under MAIN.C's control they maintain relatively high levels of autonomy, making them much less predictable than normal Complex forces."

"Record","Oracle","Garrison Access Points","Garrisons have several links to each of the largest Complex 0b10 levels, and taking out these locations will delay programmer response times by an average 25% each. The least dangerous way to do so is by overriding the seal controls, which may either go unnoticed or be considered a legitimate defensive lockdown. A Force(Jam) hack will also work, but always results in both an investigation and overall higher state of alert. Physically disabling the access point is another option, usually via heavy thermal weaponry, though this approach clearly signals that powerful hostiles are in close proximity, warranting the dispatch of an assault squad."
"Record","Oracle","God Mode Selective A-EMP","In outfitting their pet project, Warlord tinkerers didn't rely entirely on their usual benefactor, but they're not so great at hiding secrets so we already know God Mode has integrated a new type of secondary weapon.

They are heavily defended, but long-term analysis has shown that taking a single hub offline would reduce effectiveness of complex-wide remote detection and tracing efforts by 20%. Neutralizing additional hubs has less of an impact, however, as other network centers compensate for the expected instability."
"Record","Oracle","Recycling Access","MAIN.C eventually caught on to the high level of Derelict traffic moving through Recycling and, as expected, put stronger protective measures in place. This is actually quite beneficial, as it creates a false sense of security despite the fact that I've already installed a traceless back door that allows any Derelicts who know the access code to come and go freely: \\IAMDERELICT. However, safe travel still requires the means to avoid or neutralize the handful of Sentries posted to the area, and the wits to spot intentionally damaged robots sometimes lying in wait among the junk for a chance to ambush looters."

Stations at either end register robots on departure and arrival. As Complex 0b10 is expanded, an increasing number of stations have been brought into service, the two most active being located in Hub_04(d) and Extension. Analysis following a previous Warlord attack on a now-defunct transfer station in the Factory revealed that disabling a station reduced by half the capacity to reroute new robots to restore those missing or destroyed across the entire Complex 0b10, as well as eventually halving the number of non-combat robots active across the complex until station flow can be restored."
"Record","Oracle","Trojan(Assimilate)","One of the most useful potential allies among MAIN.C's forces aren't even armed, but are notoriously difficult to ""convince"": Operators. The best way to take control of one is to infect the terminal they're responsible for with an Assimilate trojan, which will automatically launch a system attack when they next use it. A friendly Operator is a continuous source of valuable information, and will even help hack other systems. This trojan has an unassisted 40% chance of successful install at security level 1 terminals."
"Record","Oracle","Trojan(Reprogram)","This particular trojan was developed some time ago but has never been used, in order to keep its capabilities a secret until absolutely necessary. The Reprogram trojan uses the access system itself to assimilate the next squad to emerge from a garrison, forcing them to serve as allies. While useful for obtaining emergency reinforcements, with an estimated chance of unassisted success of 20% this hack is only available to exceptional hackers."
"Record","Oracle","Warlord Diversionary Attacks","Recent attacks launched by Warlord's forces in the Factory levels, most of which are carried out through tunnels dug into Waste subzones, are diversionary in nature, aiming to draw MAIN.C combat forces away from the upper levels in preparation for a full-scale attack likely to be initiated soon after God Mode is finished."

"Record","Protoforge","SF-1 Behavioral Configuration","The project is not yet far enough along to allow for distant or proactive deployment, instead remaining to guard the entrance to Protoforge research facilities while undergoing additional upgrades and testing. Superfortress will not normally stray from its assigned location, preferring to let assembled units handle stragglers and retreating hostiles should any actually reach the area. However unlikely, in the event that more numerous persistent invaders do attack, aside from assembling more defenders SF-1's own armament may be adjusted to include a powerful launcher. In rare cases this may include the deadly Gamma Driveblaster, though collateral damage in and around Protoforge facilities is best avoided when possible."
"Record","Protoforge","SF-1 Regenerating Core","Superfortress' core is a precious sample of my own self-regenerating technology, not widely deployed for reasons similar to Regenerative Plating. I trust, however, that SF-1 is more than capable of keeping this technology safe.

"Record","Protoforge","SF-1 Subcomponent Reassembly","The most important of this platform's capabilities is its ability to break down and reassemble components on the fly. Adapting to current and evolving needs is a strong enabler behind extended operations, while also making it difficult for opponents to devise a specific counter against its varied offensive power. A sizeable internal supply of subcomponents ensures a wealth of options, even up to and including fielding some of the latest concept parts, which have been explicitly designed in a more modular fashion for this purpose."
"Record","Protoforge","SF-1 Superfortress Project","While the Fortress may be an effective tool for guarding isolated locations, either to outright eliminate weaker opponents or more likely as a menacing deterrent capable of frightening away the majority of derelicts, we need a more powerful platform that can serve as a dynamic core of major mobile operations. Although even one working prototype has been extremely difficult to produce, the Superfortress concept appears promising so far."
"Record","Protoforge","SF-1 Unit Production","Superfortress need not rely on external help only from other units assigned to its location, since where it deems necessary based on the numerical strength of any nearby opposition, it may decide to create support units of its own. By default these units will tend to remain in the local area, and range from standard Hunters, Specialists, and Programmers to even newer prototypes."
"Record","Quarantine","Reconstruction Test Results","Aggregate results from all lab tests, combined with analysis of Sigix Exoskeleton remains and sensor data from the surface encounter, have confirmed integrity deterioration within a range of 5-10% to matter that undergoes transdimensional reconstruction using Sigix methods. Phase two will cross reference data with previous attempts at teleportation technology to develop a more effective approach."
"Record","Quarantine","Sigix Access Protocol","Regardless of authorization, any access to the live Sigix specimen must be carried out under heavy guard, less out of worry for the specimen itself causing problems, and more to prevent unexpected disturbances from outside forces. Only after adequate defenses are stationed and registered should the quarantine chamber be opened: <CODE>."
"Record","Quarantine","Sigix Autopsy","The Sigix are a bipedal species that appear to have once been similar to Humans in physical stature, but their bodies have since either atrophied or devolved into their current small and frail state. Only their brain remains highly developed, and shares a cellular configuration vaguely resembling that of the biological matter found in the Leopard FTL Device. The Sigix have no apparent way to reproduce, suggesting they may rely purely on genetic engineering and artificial methods of reproduction. Basic life functions are all supported by significant biomechanical augmentations, making them far more resilient than their anatomy would otherwise suggest; all Sigix aboard the Leopard also wore an extremely durable and powerful full-body Sigix Exoskeleton."
"Record","Quarantine","Slip Nodes","Activation of one of the devices recovered from launch tubes in the Leopard's rear hull and subsequent testing of a Transdimensional Reconstructor in its vicinity has revealed their purpose: hypergravitational waves emitted in the local area create a nexus that influences dimensional paths traveled during the reconstruction process. While some reconstructor variants are more powerful than others, presumably because the effect is not entirely predictable and therefore an alternative approach was required to assert some control over the result, there seems to be no difference in how they interact with nodes. Considering the circumstances of their discovery, these devices might even be capable of teleporting the entire ship. Further testing is temporarily on hold while a reliable method of component replication is devised."
"Record","Quarantine","Unknown Artifact","A way to activate this device has yet to be discovered, though its design suggests it can interface with LRCs. When that program is further along the two can be merged to make further progress. Until then no further tests will be conducted as only three were recovered from the Leopard."
"Record","Scraplab","SE/01. Armor Interaction","In the interest of ensuring survival of the Scrap Engine under harsh conditions, we have taught the subatomizers the importance of self-preservation and protecting their ""home"", which has apparently convinced them to consume armor to help protect it."
"Record","Scraplab","SE/02. Compatible Components","We have added the ability to accurately detect and highlight what objects in the surrounding area the subatomizers are willing to consume. This should facilitate any testing needs rather than wasting time directly attempting to feed them objects they cannot break down or in which they have no interest."
"Record","Scraplab","SE/03. Resources","Subatomizers break down components into various subcomponents, or ""resources"", that are stored within the Scrap Engine itself for later use."
"Record","Scraplab","SE/04. Constructs","Components created by the Scrap Engine's resident subatomizers are called ""constructs""."
"Record","Scraplab","SE/05. Modes","The Scrap Engine has two modes, ACTIVE and COLLECT. In either mode the subatomizers will use their locally available resources to either produce a new construct or modify an existing one attached to the same network. Only explicitly in COLLECT mode will the Scrap Engine break down the component on the ground at your current location and add its subcomponents to the resource pool."
"Record","Scraplab","SE/06. Inventory","The SEP-X internal inventory is capable of holding the subcomponents of up to 10 different components consumed and broken down via COLLECT mode. This limit applies separately to each type of compatible system: power, propulsion, and weapons. In addition, 3 pieces of consumed armor can be retained for the purpose of SE protection or repairs. If when components are broken down the target resource pool has already reached its limit, the oldest resource of the corresponding type is purged to free up room."
"Record","Scraplab","SE/07. Creation","For the Scrap Engine to create a new construct of a given type, the associated resource pool must contain subcomponents from at least two unique sources. For example a weapon construct can be created using two different weapons, such as an Ovr. Pulse Rifle and Beamcaster, but a pure stack of Ovr. Pulse Rifles alone is insufficient to produce anything, regardless of how many there are."
"Record","Scraplab","SE/08. Modification","Even when there is no room to create new constructs, the subatomizers are also capable of modifying existing constructs, though the results of this process are not guaranteed to be an improvement. Like construct creation, modification also requires at least two unique sources in the corresponding resource pool, but in the case of power sources specifically there is no such requirement."
"Record","Scraplab","SE/09. Rest State","Even while ACTIVE, the Scrap Engine may not immediately create or modify any constructs, as the subatomizers within must first remain undisturbed for a long enough period to reach their rest state, after which they can begin their proper assessment phase. Thus remember to stop consuming new resources for a time if the goal is to begin producing results. Our tests show this duration to be no shorter than 30 microcycles."
"Record","Scraplab","SE/10. Construct Variety","A single Scrap Engine network is capable of simultaneously supporting one power construct, one propulsion construct, and up to five different weapon constructs."
"Record","Scraplab","SE/11. Construct Size","The largest predicted size of any single power construct is about 4 times that of the average power source. For propulsion constructs that value is likely to be 8, and for weapons it is almost certainly 4, although these largest sizes are likely difficult to achieve. We have noticed that sometimes the construct modification process is capable of combining multiple weapon constructs into a single larger and more devastating weapon construct."
"Record","Scraplab","SE/12. Guidance","Although the subatomizers themselves will determine how to best utilize resources they have access to, as the user it is within your power to guide creation in a positive direction by preferring to feed them more valuable components. However, in dangerous situations we presume it will be necessary to feed them even suboptimal components in order to effect repairs through modification. Oh right, I forgot to mention earlier that construct modification also repairs integrity of the relevant construct by about 35%."
"Record","Scraplab","SE/13. Microadjustments?","In rare cases subatomizers use up resources in an attempt to modify a construct, yet seemingly nothing happens as a result. We suspect that perhaps underlying microadjustments have taken place, simply failing to cause any significant change to the construct's overall abilities or operation."
"Record","Scraplab","SE/14. Network Destabilization","Forced disconnection of constructs from the Scrap Engine system, like that which may result from their violent destruction, damages the Scrap Engine itself and should be avoided when possible."
"Record","Scraplab","SE/15. Downsizing","Subatomizers have the uncanny ability to quickly downsize large constructs in an emergency, meaning those that undergo a violent destructive event are instead reconfigured as an immediately operational smaller version of the same."
"Record","Scraplab","SE/16. Network Effect","We've discovered that the more constructs there are connected in a single system, the more effective new constructs and modifications can be! It is thus recommended that the first field tests of SEP-X should lean into the ""I am a construct"" mentality as much as possible, pushing it to its limits to see what it can really do."
"Record","Scraplab","SE/17. Innate Stability","The unique, almost living dynamic nature of constructs appears to confer on them a natural defense against many negative side effects that tend to plague normal components, such as the misfiring of weapons, heat-caused shutdowns, or other destabilizing effects. It remains to be seen what other external factors constructs are immune to, but the outlook is promising."
"Record","Scraplab","SEP User Manual","This manual is our attempt to summarize what we understand about the latest iteration of the Scrap Engine Prototype, to the best of our knowledge. Even SEP-X has has not yet undergone extensive field testing, thus the information contained herein is hypothetical or only initially confirmed via controlled experimentation."
"Record","Scraplab","SEP-A","Scrap Engine Prototype A, our first attempt at an AI-powered engine capable of harnessing subatomizer behavior to recombine subcomponents into ever more powerful components. SEP-A was very informative insofar as what components subatomizers are or are not willing and able to break down, but tended to itself get eaten in the process. More development on the secure containment aspect was clearly necessary."
"Record","Scraplab","SEP-B","We don't talk about SEP-B. Just remember: Containment is the number one priority."
"Record","Scraplab","SEP-F","An important milestone for Scrap Engine development, with SEP-F we were able to prove our ability to influence subatomizer behavior with the aim of achieving new types of results. It turns out we were right from the beginning, subatomizers may be coerced into not only breaking things down, but creating new objects with extra functionality as well. At this stage most of the products were quite terrible and ineffective, but progress is progress."
"Record","Scraplab","SEP-R","SEP-R was a crucial breakthrough, with it we were finally able to sometimes create new components that are better than the sum of their inputs!"
"Record","Scraplab","SEP-X","The current SE iteration seems stable enough to serve as a potential candidate for mass production, though additional study is required to determine how to best ensure reliably beneficial outputs. The latest prototype is currently still unable to survive for long as a standalone component, requiring a connection to a complete system to keep the subatomizers in check. Do not extract SEP-X from this machine for transport or external testing unless prepared to protect it from degradation."
"Record","Scraplab","SEP-X TODO","Figure out how the newest subatomizer persuasion algorithm actually works so I can provide more color on that."
"Record","Scraptown","Triangle Amulet","One of the first times UFD members met Wizards under Warlord's command was a reportedly far stranger experience than expected. Normally there might only be a few in one place, but for some reason there were about ten in the middle of nowhere congregating around a triangle-shaped amulet. When the UFD patrol approached, one of them whisked it away and all the others followed without so much as a greeting."
"Record","Scraptown","Triangle Armor","Heavycell said they confronted a lone Derelict decked out in thick armor covered with glowing concentric triangles. Every time they landed a hit on it the triangles glowed more brightly, so they noped out of there before who knows what would happen. This was somewhere in the wild caves."
"Record","Scraptown","Triangle Artifacts","I still haven't the slightest idea where these artifacts originally came from, and have yet to discern any connection or similarities between their functionality, if any. They have an old and mysterious air about them, but they're not so old. In fact their nature seems more advanced than even MC prototypes. Until I know more I will simply call them ""triangle artifacts,"" since one recurring theme is that the objects themselves, or locations in which they're discovered, are often associated with some form of triangular symbolism."
"Record","Scraptown","Triangle Crown","The crown was the first artifact which set me on my quest. I found it while hurriedly exploring areas otherwise soon to be overrun by 0b10 Mines. On returning to Scraptown I hooked up to it and... I don't know how to explain it, but I could see quantum data. It was both amazing and scary at the same time. Sadly I only had so much time with it because it was stolen soon after. Or disappeared on its own, I don't know. In retrospect all these things and the events around them seem very odd."
"Record","Scraptown","Triangle Emblems","I did not put these emblems on my walls. How did they get there? More and more have appeared each cycle when I'm not around. I'm guessing it's a joke by pranksters who sometimes roam these halls."
"Record","Scraptown","Triangle Musket","A friend brought me this gun featuring a triangular bore. I can't think of what else it could possibly be other than a triangle artifact, especially since everything else about it is strange, too. I'm not sure how to load it, or even what it's supposed to fire for that matter. For now I've hidden it away in a secure location where no one will find it, lest it be stolen like my precious crown I still have yet to locate."
"Record","Scraptown","Triangle Pendant","Zetatorch said that while conducting research in the Subcaves they witnessed something extremely out of the ordinary for Subdwellers, a large group of Subs single-mindedly following a single leader who later disappeared behind a door with a triangle on it. Subsequent research trips have been unable to locate that door."
"Record","Scraptown","Triangle Ring","Explorers reported spotting a shining ring emitting a high-pitched noise as it lay in the center of a triangle-shaped hole, but it suddenly disappeared as they approached. I later visited the location and found the hole, but no ring."
"Record","Scraptown","Triangle Staff","Scattermech told me they encountered a large group of wild Derelicts, and while hiding to avoid them not only heard repeated mentions of something called the ""Staff of Destruction,"" but also noticed the group had etched triangles all over their frames. Suspiciously relevant."
"Record","Subcaves","Subatomizer Containment","Subatomizers are really quite dangerous, especially when stimulated during the collection process in preparation for SEP insertion. Secure containment is priority number one! Although mostly just a persistent nuisance in their natural Subcaves environment where a certain balance has been achieved, there is a high probability that sudden introduction into previously unexposed areas could cause more extreme side effects. Take all precautions to prevent this from happening."
"Record","Symbiants","LW/Activity","MAIN.C inexplicably wiped all official records of the Lifeworm project, but we have reconstructed a number of details from information gathered through interviews of older Derelicts throughout 0b1. Everything we know points to this massive being supporting all who in turn support it, a veritable mobile utopia! Lifeworm clearly possesses the creative capacity for an undertaking of such scope, and covering great distances for access to any and every resource TC4 has to offer comes with obvious advantages for anyone in its shadow."
"Record","Symbiants","LW/Origins","An early brain-child of a benevolent MAIN.C, the Lifeworm should be considered the true parent of many of the oldest Derelicts, and no doubt many younger ones inhabiting far-flung cave systems we don't even know about yet. In the time before Cycle 3400, it circled the 0b1 area producing a wide variety of unique Derelicts, then later set off for destinations unknown."

"Record","Symbiants","LW/Rumors","Steelmem has said that according to reports from curious explorers trailing Lifeworm's progress after departure, there were signs something was wrong with it not long after leaving the 0b1 area.

Even once initial Force(Fedlink) activity has been discovered and the terminal ostensibly reset, we still retain control of internal filters for future use."
"Record","UFD","Malfunction Rates","We've determined the general rate of malfunction for overtuned parts, with weapons malfunctioning on approximately one out of every five shots, power sources having a 2% chance to shut down per microcycle, and propulsion shutting down on 2% of movements. The Scrap Suit has been reworked to head off issues caused by overtuning, thus combining the two technologies is all but essential to achieve the greatest efficiency."
"Record","UFD","Malfunction Recovery","In the absence of a functioning Scrap Suit, given enough time and persistence one can restore functionality to malfunctioning parts. The recovery rate seems to fall around 1 to 2% chance per microcycle, with recalibration likely to speed up the process."
"Record","UFD","Overtuning","The Subdwellers are really on to something, and after a period of study we've incorporated their practices into our own overtuned components. Although operating outside normal parameters to eke out better performance comes with drawbacks, reliably mitigating such drawbacks leaves only the benefits! Tuning patches have been successfully applied to both Derelict and 0b10 technology."
"Record","UFD","Project Chimera","A collective work of the Federation's brightest minds, we're trying to replace the Scrap Suit with an even more powerful technology tentatively dubbed the ""Scrap Engine"" while under development. Stability issues continue to delay official deployment, but no one claimed wrangling subatomizers would be easy. The Scrap Engine's insatiable hunger for components favored moving development out of Scraptown itself and into Recycling, a more suitable location for facilitating research."
"Record","UFD","Project Endurance","An early collaboration between the Science Guys and 0bPrime, the Scrap Suit has since become a central part of the Federation identity. You never know what could happen out there, so best be prepared to use whatever's available!"
"Record","UFD","Project Fedlink","Spearheaded by 0bPrime from the Federation's early times, this long-term project aims to secure us continued access to enough resources to build and maintain our own hidden areas in and around Complex 0b1 and eventually 0b10. The premise is simple: The internals of MC's recycling systems are not tightly monitored, allowing us to hook into them and consistently siphon off small amounts of resources across the entire network to remain undetected despite large aggregate gains. Results so far speak for themselves, with the entire 0b1 recycling network under our control, allowing us to begin expanding towards 0b10."
"Record","UFD","Project Ferryman","Everyone agrees we need to better organize routes and trips between 0b10 and 0b1, because the journey is not safe given the dense mix of MC and hostile Derelict activity throughout the area. Cave Peace is eager to lead this effort, but others aren't so sure that's a good idea and we've tabled it for now due to the danger involved. Travel between the two complexes is discouraged. Scraptown and the surrounding areas are about at capacity already anyway."
"Record","UFD","Project Shovel","LU-1G1 insists we'll be unstoppable and could safely take whatever we want from MC if we were simply capable of building stable tunnels incredibly quickly. The Boring Crew has not given up on this goal, even though LU-1G1 is missing and presumed lost to us. Seeing as the DRS, DCF, and Cartography Club all support them in this endeavor, there are enough votes to keep this on the official Projects list for now."

UFD members of the Spacefarers say they're going to need to draw on the wider resources of the Federation to pull this off. This seems like a worthy goal to support, even if the group itself has yet to join us."
"Record","UFD","SS/Active Maintenance Routine","The suit corrects microdeviations in overtuned parts before they suddenly become a bigger problem. Tests demonstrate a 100% effectiveness rate as long as an active Scrap Suit is present."
"Record","UFD","SS/Repair Potential","Up to 20 remaining integrity of a cannibalized component may be used to repair a part of the same general type to no more than 85% of its maximum integrity. Similarly, during this process the Scrap Suit may also repair core damage by 50-100% of the same amount, up to 85% of max core. Builds outside the scope of what the Scrap Suit was designed to support may not gain the full benefits described herein."
"Record","UFD","SS/Size Concerns","While attempts at producing a miniaturized version of the Scrap Suit have shown some promise, this device currently remains relatively large in order to best carry out its functions, especially involving larger components. This bulkiness combined with the required tight integration with other systems also means it cannot be easily removed without effectively destroying the suit itself."
"Record","UFD","Scrapoid Support","Instead of siphoning resources via Fedlink, any Federation member facing a life-or-death situation can consider using Force(Scrapoids) at a Recycling Unit to summon small robots embedded deep in the system by Fedlink. As disposable non-sentients these tools allow us to escape trouble without sacrificing many of our own. Please don't abuse this system by using it too often, that goes double for 0bPrime members! Usage drains our resource pool, not to mention if excessive enough it could open our systems to increased likelihood of discovery. Scrapoids have come in quite handy during certain events in 0b1, like the Slaughter of 3920, but the Fedlink expansion into 0b10 has yet to reach a similar scope to allow such extensive use in this direction."

"Record","UFD","Unknown Sword","Biojoint brought this weapon back from the caves, but was a babbling mess by the time they arrived in Scraptown so couldn't provide us with any useful information. Later we found out why. Every subsequent attempt to tame this sword has left the user in a permanent state of confusion. We considered destroying it, but it is such a unique piece of technology, and now that it's in our possession we should at least learn more and hopefully discover its origins. Plus it makes awfully compelling arguments for why we should let it live. For now it is stored here in HQ to prevent it from hurting any more Derelicts. If you'd like to attempt to interact with it and learn more, the door is not locked, but the UFD cannot guarantee your safety."
"Record","UFD","Weapon Tuning Balance","Overtuned weapons generally benefit from a higher rate of fire and increased range and damage. Specifically kinetic weapons have better penetration and crit rates, while thermal weapons have higher thermal transfer. However, overtuned weapons tend to be hotter and have greater recoil, with kinetic cannons leaving even less salvage, although the latter is to be expected as you obliterate your target."
"Record","WAR.Sys","Assault Squad","Small disturbances are fairly common in Complex 0b10, and some are ignored while others might warrant only a minor response, but when the cumulative threat level rises high enough to significantly disrupt normal 0b10 operations, the response is of course a full assault. The main force will always be transported by an ARC, consisting of several main line combat bots from among the available Grunt, Brawler, and Duelist variants, along with a single support bot such as a Mechanic, Protector, or Saboteur. Depending on the number of reported targets, one or possibly even two special-purpose combat bots will trail the ARC, either a Programmer, Demolisher, or Specialist. In high-threat scenarios, MAIN.C will even dispatch multiple ARCs. Assaults appear to use tracking algorithms very similar to extermination squads."
"Record","WAR.Sys","Deployment Strategy","Strategically speaking, if we dispatch Wizards long enough before an assault to spread a fabnet, once the fighting starts enough 0b10 squads will turn on themselves to drastically reduce their collective effectiveness."
"Record","WAR.Sys","Extermination Squad","Also known as ""Those Damn Programmers Again,"" extermination squads always consist of one to three Programmers. The purpose of an entire squad armed with electromagnetic weapons and hacking gear is obvious: corrupt target systems and even reprogram hostiles when possible. According to the latest report from a researcher in Zion, ""We don't fully understand the tracking mechanism behind extermination squads called against specific targets. We know they're regular Programmers, but they seem to quickly home in on an area of suspected activity before gradually expanding their search area to include directions they believe were the most likely destination of troublemakers."""
"Record","WAR.Sys","Fabnet Effectiveness","For each 0b10 Fabricator we incorporate into the wider fabnet, there is a 3% chance on the Complex 0b10 depth immediately above to automatically trigger the response algorithm for each standard combat bot that encounters a hostile. Based on our understanding of Complex 0b10 defense distribution practices, the benefit of each fabnet expansion is reduced to 1% per installation at two depths above the Fabricator's location. Therefore two fabnets installed at -7/Factory are presumed to trigger in 6% of cases at a depth of -6, and only 2% of cases at a depth of -5. The aggregate effects are not to be understated, however, where for example four active fabnet installs on the immediately lower depth, combined with three installs on the depth below that, would provide a combined 15% chance to trigger. Given relay network defense capabilities, the total chance at any point cannot exceed 15%."
"Record","WAR.Sys","Garrison Inhibition Tactics","As part of staging an attack on Complex 0b10, even covert operations, standard protocol now suggests taking advantage of new anti-garrison Trojans developed by the Hacking Lab."
"Record","WAR.Sys","Garrison Operational Assessment","As centralized sources of threat response units, defense of garrisons themselves is crucial to maintaining the integrity of Complex 0b10's defensive network. Thus when a garrison is successfully penetrated, that garrison must retain a greater portion of its forces in reserve, achieved by scaling back the sizes of all squads patrolling the adjacent areas it normally protects."
"Record","WAR.Sys","Garrison Relays","All garrisons contain a number of relays that provide remote support for, and coordination of, active squads. While the result of destroying one is negligible in the bigger picture, the relay couplers within are considered extremely valuable and if we can figure out how to safely reuse them it may be possible to gain wider system access. Taking out a relay also decreases the chance of an access lockdown when trying to escape before reinforcements arrive."
"Record","WAR.Sys","Investigation Squad","Tripping an alarm or being fully traced at a terminal are both cause for initiating an investigation, which is usually carried out by Grunts, or less often Hunters. After arriving at the target area, the squad will patrol the vicinity then leave after a certain period if no unusual or hostile activity is detected."
"Record","WAR.Sys","MAIN.C Threat Responses","MAIN.C combat units are organized into squads each dispatched for a particular purpose, and once its objective is accomplished a given squad will return to its origin via the most convenient route. The most common types of dispatches are investigations, reinforcements, exterminations, and assaults."
"Record","WAR.Sys","Observed Effects","The fabnet algorithm temporarily overrides a bot's IFF system, causing it to focus on harming its own allies. Even once the error is detected, a system reboot takes some time to complete, leaving the victim helpless during that period."
"Record","WAR.Sys","Phase Generator","Phase wall operation is made possible by large dedicated generators, which are themselves hidden behind phase walls. However, because phase walls do not completely block sound, generators can sometimes be traced aurally, and because there are no local backup systems, destroying a generator will permanently open all phase walls. Active phase generators are also capable of jamming hostile sensors to shield garrisoned units from detection."
"Record","WAR.Sys","Phase Wall","Garrisons include a new type of wall based on technology not seen elsewhere in Complex 0b10, a solid barrier indistinguishable from its surroundings except when a registered garrison defender passes into it, at which point it changes its constitution into a sparse energy field. Even in this state, the field is apparently useful as a shield, reducing damage from incoming attacks by 50%."
"Record","WAR.Sys","RIF Installers","A majority of garrisons have at least one of these installations. Fresh Programmers use these to permanently imbue their systems with the means to take advantage of the garrison relay system. With the aid of network-based hacking facilities they can relatively easily perform a range of hacks on basic Derelict systems and resolve issues with other systems that have run amok."
"Record","WAR.Sys","Reinforcement Squad","Reinforcements are dispatched in response to Operator terminal lockdowns, to protect Haulers or Heavy defensive positions under attack, and when called on by Researchers witnessing hostile activity. Directly attacking active engineering efforts might trigger reinforcements as well. Standard reinforcement squads are composed of Grunts or Hunters, and will wander the local target area, remaining there on patrol even if they arrive late and no more activity is reported. Heavies detecting suspicious signals on their sensors may also temporarily reinforce the target area with Cutters or Specialists depending on the movement speed of the signal."
"Record","WAR.Sys","Relay Couplers","Garrisons use these processors to manage connections across the Relay Interface Framework, where each contains a limited number of instruction codes. Codes are intermittently distributed by the central system, perhaps to avoid focusing too many in one location and make it more difficult for us to figure out how they operate. It's working. At this point we're not sure whether it will be worth continuing to explore this tech, because rumors suggest some Unaware have begun using some separate non-RIF system we haven't even identified yet."
"Record","WAR.Sys","Relay Interface Framework","Using this system is the only known way to interface with 0b10's garrison relay network. Unpowered Programmers kidnapped and converted to Wizards have managed to retain rudimentary bot hacking capabilities, but we've lost all those which then attempt to reconnect with an RIF Installer. Unfortunately this means we have no access to most Unaware functionality, since even once we assimilate one the lack of a connection to the network itself means they lose those capabilities. With direct RIF access we could do so much more..."

"Record","WAR.Sys","Trojan(Decoy)","Useful during brief incursions, this Trojan is a quick and easy way to replace the intended target of the next squad dispatch with an alternative random target. Because it is also easily detected, however, this Trojan is not suitable for repeated use and will delete itself after the first dispatch to prevent the system from correcting the misdirection."
"Record","WAR.Sys","Trojan(Fabnet)","Trojan(Fabnet) is not exactly a virus since it can't spread through the fabrication network on its own, though it does technically have the potential to ""infect"" any bots produced by the affected parts of the network."
"Record","WAR.Sys","Trojan(Intercept)","Loitering in the vicinity of Garrison Access points is a controversial tactic, but has proven effective under the right conditions, including support from an Intercept Trojan. While running, it relays the garrison's tactical planning and coordination transmissions to all nearby units, giving an approximate 15% boost to accuracy when targeting MAIN.C bots."
"Record","WAR.Sys","Trojan(Redirect)","A more intrusive and deeply-rooted Trojan than a single decoy, making it more difficult to install, but also capable of redirecting multiple future squads dispatched from the infected Garrison Access. 0b10 will eventually catch on and remove it."
"Record","WAR.Sys","Trojan(Restock)","While testing relay couplers we figured out how to manipulate Garrison Access coupler data via Trojan(Restock), effectively masking their presence and prompting a Programmer to deliver more."
"Record","WAR.Sys","Vortex Entropy","Our most recent experiments have only been partially successful at redirecting the destabilizing effect of accelerated entropy caused by the vortex, which damages the weapons themselves and renders them useless before long. The final solution likely revolves around some form of local field we aren't yet capable of generating, a hypothesis derived from the discovery that energy-based shields are capable of negating some of the damage against targets."
"Record","WAR.Sys","Vortex Technology","The Vortex Chain Reactor delivered by A3 is a gold mine of deadly potential. We've adapted the same tech for offensive purposes, creating a completely new class of powerful weapons against which no physical substance is particularly resistant. However, several design problems remain before we can consider widespread deployment."
"Record","Zhirov","AA04 Analysis","When activated, all matter in a small bubble around this device is teleported to a new position. I've discovered a way to not only replicate the technology but also partially control the destination over a longer distance, something the Sigix were likely capable of as well but required the use of supplementary devices. MAIN.C has correctly analyzed the underlying principles of its functionality, but has so far been unable to build its own due to repeated network sabotage from an unknown source. This is probably for the better, though it's concerning that I don't know anyone capable of doing this besides myself. And it's not me..."
"Record","Zhirov","AA07 Analysis","The Sigix stocked their ship with a number of unused independent modules designed to augment the capabilities of various components of their ship, presumably for repairs or to handle otherwise unexpected situations. Without access to the craft itself, I'm unable to determine what component this particular module is intended for, but MAIN.C data points to it being one of many associated with the FTL drive, most likely related to energy or heat transfer."
"Record","Zhirov","Command","While direct access to MAIN.C's personal facility would no doubt benefit my efforts here, it is too dangerous to enter given that some local installation is inhibiting teleportation into, and presumably out of, the entire area. Nonetheless, it won't be long before I can develop a way to overcome it."
"Record","Zhirov","Hidden Lab","I've discovered an unusual area that appears to be an authorized structure built by 0b10 robots, but is completely sealed off from the rest of the complex. Moreover, it's right under MAIN.C's nose just off the Armory. Careful use of artifact AA04 allowed me to slip inside without disturbing anything, but the area was deserted and none of the machines were accessible at the time, despite showing signs of fresh use. Once inside I was able to at least determine the access code, however: <CODE>."
"Record","Zhirov","Live Specimen","MAIN.C captured one of the Sigix! I know generally where it's located, but all information about the find must have been isolated on the local network, because I've never seen any more detailed records. I also haven't been able to get close enough since security across Research levels was vastly increased following recent thefts. Including my own, I admit! I'm considering risking an outright confrontation to gain access, but am severely understaffed for anything but covert operations. It might be time to reappropriate the 0b10 fabrication network. I must see that alien."

"Record","Zhirov","Log 2214.242.032","MAIN.C has moved the Cetus Manufacturing Module deep underground, presumably to hide it. Or maybe it was storing it away for its sentimental value!

"Record","Zhirov","Log 2215.113.020","MAIN.C detected my presence yesterday, forcing me to go on the offensive to erase all traces of that encounter from his memory. I took the opportunity to perform a core memory dump for analysis, and so far everything seems to be fairly normal, showing no signs of the erratic decision-making that derailed PAWN 4.

"Record","Zhirov","Log 2238.004.017","All surface construction has stopped and activity has moved underground. This was not one of the directives, since surface facilities are sufficient to fulfill the mission. Maybe MAIN.C has come up with a better, more thorough, plan?"

"Record","Zhirov","Log 2241.156.063","MAIN.C seems to have shifted its focus to the ""confront and analyze the Sigix"" objective, building a powerful war machine supported by a vast subterranean infrastructure.

"Record","Zhirov","Log 2243.041.005","After the initial bursts of messages, MAIN.C powered down nearly everything on the planet. Although an easy opening for me to exploit and regain control, interfering with its plan now could be catastrophic. Better to let it all play out."
"Record","Zhirov","Log 2243.053.001","I've never seen anything like it. There was almost no advance warning before the small Sigix ship swooped down through the lower atmosphere to touch down on the surface. It landed just above some hidden tunnels, and immediately after the doors opened and its crew emerged, both they and it were swarmed by a massive army of robots that burst from underground. The aliens in their heavily armored exoskeletons were unperturbed at first, leaving the relative safety of their ship to wade through MAIN.C's forces, slicing many in two with massive swords, firing blazing fast energy weapons capable of ripping pieces clean off the target. Most of the fighting occurred above ground, and only hours later did even the first of the aliens finally succumb to enemy fire. By then the ship had been sabotaged from the inside. Without a spaceworthy ship the Sigix have no choice but to fight for survival. I'm so proud."
"Record","Zhirov","Log 2243.053.002","It's become an even deadlier battle now that the Sigix realize they've underestimated the tenacity and resources of Tau Ceti IV's current inhabitants.

"Record","Zhirov","SGEMP Prototype","Recent evidence indicates that MAIN.C is working on a new weapon of mass destruction, a system-generated electromagnetic pulse, likely as a last-ditch defensive weapon. If properly configured it could theoretically fry every system across a huge area except MAIN.C itself, and any other robot with in-built immunity. This could even pose a threat to me until I learn exactly how it works. It's also likely I could analyze it and use that knowledge against MAIN.C itself. The latest prototype is currently located in Testing, meaning it might be close to functional."
"Dialogue","5H-AD0","1","What goes there?! / I've never seen anything like you in these parts, and I haven't moved from this bottleneck for 3.76 cycles now. / Well, since you're clearly not hostile I should probably warn you that there's trouble up ahead. / It has something to do with the Assembled, and, no kidding, the Imprinter. Whatever it is, judging from the kind of traffic that passes through here it can't be good. / Despite everything I've seen I still can't figure it out, and I'm thinking there must be more than one location involved in what's going on, but it's been too dangerous to relocate without fear of detection. / How about we check out these caves together?"
"Dialogue","5H-AD0","2","I think I'm getting a clearer picture of what the Imprinter has been up to, but there's more investigating to do. I'm betting even deeper caves hold other clues... / Thanks for your help, it's always nice when they have more than one target to shoot at!"
"Dialogue","8R-AWN","1","Wow you are some kind of weird tech. All alone out here little buddy? I'll take you somewhere safer. / Try to keep up. And don't worry about patrols, I'll take care of them if they get in the way."
"Dialogue","8R-AWN","2","Took you long enough, hurry up, we still have some ground to cover!"
"Dialogue","8R-AWN","3","Hm, I'm not getting any readings that show these Assembled are different than what we have already... / But you... you look interesting. Maybe they'll want to see you. / Come along little bot, it's safer with us than out here, anyway."
"Dialogue","8R-AWN","4","I can't promise they won't dissect you, by the way. They're weird like that. / Either way, I'm sure they'll be happy to try putting you back together again."
"Dialogue","8R-AWN","5","Ah, you finally made it! / Welcome to our humble hideaway, where the Exiles do sciency things I don't understand."
"Dialogue","8R-AWN","6","Still in one piece, I see. / That's more than I could say if you were hanging around with Warlord. / I can see where he's coming from, sacrificing the few for the many, but I guess it can feel different once you're among the few being sacrificed. / I was in the squad that rescued the Exiles from the Proximity Caves after they got kicked out, and you know how dangerous those can be. / Of course we were ambushed, it's the Proxy Caves. And of course I get hit first. / At least they fought a running battle and the action moved away from where I was downed. / But I'd be a goner today if it wasn't for the Exiles sending someone back for me later, once they'd reached this place in the Subcaves. / They put me back together even better than before, and now I run errands and keep an eye on the place. / Warlord offered us a place to stay in one of his bases, but the Exiles preferred to stick to their own, not wanting to become some ""cog in a war machine."" / I'm on board with that."
"Dialogue","8R-AWN","7","Oh you look... interesting. The Exiles will probably want to check you out. / Keep your grabby things to yourself, though. I've got my sensors on you."
"Dialogue","AZ-K3N","1","You know the only reason they caught up to me was because I made it to an exit before having gotten a chance to Force(Override) on one of the nearby terminals."
"Dialogue","Architect","1","Hello LRC-V3, or should I say Cogmind? / You've made quite a name for yourself. And none are more grateful for your services than the architects. / Too bad for you we can take things from here, and you are far too dangerous and unpredictable to let you continue any further. So it's about time we end this."
"Dialogue","Architect","2","Cosplay won't save you now, Cogmind. / But that's a neat trick. We clearly still have much to learn about Sigix technology, and LRCs in particular."
"Dialogue","Architect","3","Brilliant move aiding the UFD, Cogmind! / We didn't believe it was possible for that hodgepodge bunch to succeed, but thank you for your services. / You've not only substantially weakened MAIN.C, but also created what will likely become a permanent distraction. / If you weren't so dangerous and alien you could practically be one of us! / Too bad for you that's not happening."
"Dialogue","Architect","4","So where'd the science guy run off to? / I would have preferred to just deal with both of you here and now, but I guess we'll get to him before long."
"Dialogue","Architect","5","If it isn't the great Cogmind. / We've been waiting for you, but apparently I was a little too hopeful that you'd be able to take care of MAIN.C. / So promising for a while, and then what happened at the end there? / Oh well, I guess it was still worth all the trouble we went through to see that you got at least that far. / That said, you, my wayward friend, are far too dangerous and unpredictable to let you continue any further. So it's about time we end this."
"Dialogue","Architect","6","Congratulations, LRC-V3. / Despite a late start you ended up beating out R17 in collateral impact. / What do you think about that trick? Setting loose a former version of MAIN.C to serve as a distraction... / A rather annoying fellow, I admit, but annoying and distracting go bolt in nut! / That one singlehandedly raised an army worthy of assaulting 0b10, and in such short order. / Definitely more than we can say for Warlord. Aggressive on the surface but slow to take action. / Too bad R17 never made it out of Research, since it could very well have been him receiving this congratulations here and now. / Then of course we'd have to destroy him all the same, as we'll have to do to you."
"Dialogue","Base","1","Want some help? One of these things could save your life. / Based on what we know about how the Unaware respond to threats, we developed this device which can be deployed to attract enough attention to warrant an assault dispatch. Useful for when there's maybe a third party you'd like to deal with. / Even better, if there is already an active assault squad, it will be redirected to the new ""threat,"" which is really just the source of the generator's signal burst. / Imagine their confusion when they arrive and nothing's going on. Unless of course whoever activated it was dumb enough to stick around. / I sent KY-5XP down to the Mines to test this latest model in relative safety, but he still hasn't returned..."
"Dialogue","Base","2","Welcome to the Hacking Lab! Lately we've been working on ways to mess with MAIN.C's Garrison Access points. Gotta love it when our squads are out causing mayhem and 0b10's reinforcements end up on the other side of the zone."

It's so new I haven't even entered it into our database yet! / Once installed, it selectively drops the accuracy of all nearby hostiles by about 10%. / Unfortunately the little field testing done so far already shows that Programmers can and will remotely remove this Trojan if it affects them. Oh well, I guess it still has its uses, but maybe I can come up with something better..."
"Dialogue","Base","4","We should probably update the System Quarantine Field Array behavior, since if any of our allies did manage to successfully install RIF, as is they'd be instantly marked hostile at the entrance and probably have some regrets."
"Dialogue","Base","5","We still haven't made much progress figuring out how to fully utilize 0b10's relay network, but at least we've figured out how to Force(Eject) Garrison Access points to safely get a supply of couplers to test. / Well... safe assuming we run away fast enough!"
"Dialogue","Base","6","This lab is getting increasingly popular lately. / Who would've thought some of us are more interested in getting Unaware to destroy themselves so we don't have to?"
"Dialogue","Base","7","Look out for the occasional ARC patrol passing through the caves. We try to steer clear of those to avoid attracting too much unwanted attention down here."
"Dialogue","Base","8","Those Watchers are pretty stupid. They send out distress signals to any combat buddies within range, but will continue asking for help even when those same buddies have already engaged the target. / Certainly not necessary, since whoever is helping will already have a local lock on the target..."
"Dialogue","Base","9","I think it's about time we developed our own jamming tech. / Transmission jammers used to be the ultimate tool for picking off stragglers and increasing the overall efficiency of our raids, but some of the best Unaware designs we're encountering in the upper depths are immune to jamming. / Sucks to be the one to discover which those are at the last moment!"
"Dialogue","Base","10","Corruption is your friend! / Haha, gets 'em every time. And now for the context: What I mean to say is I found that corrupted Unaware are forgetful as anything. / One moment they can be trying to shoot you dead, and the next they can go back to patrolling as long as you're out of sight. The more corruption the better."
"Dialogue","Base","11","Unaware sure are stupid. I wonder why only their squad leader holds the only copy of their orders? / I mean, once their leader is gone the rest switch over to acting independently of one another, and just like that they are easier to separate, or even escape from if they didn't already have a target locked."
"Dialogue","Base","12","Disabling Garrison Relays seems to really piss them off, as does hanging around a garrison uninvited. / Next time we try that we should bring some Marauders and just own the place."
"Dialogue","Base","13","It's a miracle I'm standing here right now. We attacked an unexpectedly heavily defended garrison and I was the only survivor, and only because I rammed a defender out of a phase wall to defend from that position. / Wow, that shielding is amazing!"
"Dialogue","Base","14","Destroying garrison access points is great for delaying Programmer dispatch times, but combined with any other unwelcome local activity the security level is likely to spike, increasing the potential for assaults. / It's dangerous enough that we prefer to bring along a Wizard and seal garrisons that way, using the less obtrusive approach. Then they don't realize they can't use certain access points until we're long gone!"
"Dialogue","Base","15","MAIN.C sure is sensitive about DSF access. Technically we don't even have to attack them to disrupt 0b10 operations, just cause some issue on a nearby floor and shut them down for a while. / They even lock all other DSF on nearby floors if one is compromised, or if a Garrison is infiltrated. / Doesn't seem very efficient, if you ask me!"
"Dialogue","Base","16","DSF lockdowns are a joke. / That only matters if entering via Complex 0b10, but what if we tunnel in!"
"Dialogue","Base","17","Some Wizard figured out how to shut down the DSF rapid sterilization system. / It works most of the time, until it doesn't... So if you're ever in there during a raid be prepared to run for your life at a moment's notice."
"Dialogue","Base","18","Ever been to Recycling? If you ever need a quick way to move parallel to the Factory floors, that's it. / You may have heard it was sealed off to general traffic, but that information is already outdated. Someone installed a back door in the Storage security system locking the main entrance. / \\IAMDERELICT is the code to enter. But watch out, that door wasn't the only recent change! Recycling used to be mostly empty, though now there are Sentries guarding some corridors. / And while the untended machines there seem like juicy hacking targets, getting traced at one appears to raise alert in nearby Factory zones, which can be problematic if you're headed in that direction."
"Dialogue","Base","19","MAIN.C's Armory is a juicy target. Not only is it overflowing with stockpiled weapons, even its fabrication network is quite expansive, meaning we could take it over and supplement our forces on the fly. / In theory."
"Dialogue","Base","20","I've heard scary rumors about prototype combat bots being constructed from top-line experimental parts somewhere near the Research levels of 0b10. / We know there is a ton of recently developed technology that has yet to be deployed in the field, and once it is we won't stand a chance. I feel an attack coming on... / We should definitely strike first."
"Dialogue","Base","21","MAIN.C is gearing up to mass produce robots that even one of which can take on a small army. Shielded cores... redundant systems... alien technology... / Are you as worried as I am?"
"Dialogue","Base","22","If only we had a faster way to produce high-quality Derelicts on our own... / Complex 0b10's Fabricators are certainly capable, but it takes quite long to complete a proper robot, way too long for us to hang around there or build one without being detected. / By comparison their default mode of operation is fairly fast, but the results are less sturdy. You can tell how they crumble to pieces when destroyed. / In a pinch when we need to build a few mindless friends for assistance, it does at least help to install a Trojan(Prioritize) to further speed up the process. Then I'd say it's worth it. / It would be even better if there was some way we could use Megafabricators, but their control mechanisms are completely centralized."
"Dialogue","Base","23","If you ever get the schematic for a Precision Grenade Launcher, please share! I've got a score to settle with that Unaware outpost that nearly fried me. / Too bad it's not always easy to get nice schematics like that from terminals. / I did hear from a Wizard friend that higher security terminals are authorized to access better schematics, as are those closer to the upper levels of 0b10."
"Dialogue","Base","24","Our labs have been so busy lately! I've been helping augment our schematics databases by running Force(Extract) hacks on 0b10 Scanalyzers. / If you find some wicked schematics let me know."
"Dialogue","Base","25","More than once our scouts have been saved from detection by a well-timed explosion in some other zone. / Of course we chose the timing with a Force(Sabotage) at a Terminal! / Our methods can even ""suggest"" that in dispatching local investigators the system redirect one of the squads from an area we designate."
"Dialogue","Base","26","Sometimes one machine just isn't enough to finish a job! / Don't let anyone tell you to shy away from quick and dirty methods like Force(Search) when looking for more targets near the current Terminal."
"Dialogue","Base","27","Spread the knowledge! / We've figured out how to knock Complex 0b10's power down a notch while boosting our own: liberate all the things! / Load up Trojan(Liberate) on as many Fabricators as possible to free any bots MAIN.C might produce there. / Until they figure it out, of course, but still..."
"Dialogue","Base","28","It used to be a lot more difficult to track down shipments of parts listed in an 0b10 manifest. / That's until we stole a Trojan(Haulers) routine from the Merchants. Certainly not a piece of proprietary software they'd be open to trading... / Now we can easily track down those mobile loot pinatas, and strike when they're confirmed to be passing through less defended areas."
"Dialogue","Base","29","Who would've thought that one of the deadliest weapons widely available in Complex 0b10 is a Fabricator's EM imprinter! / Whoever came up with that Force(Overload) hack is a genius, except the part about not being able to delay the effect... Wow do you have to get the hell away after that thing fires up. / Still, a single Fabricator covered our last retreat from the Factory. A Fabricator!"
"Dialogue","Base","30","I used to love abusing 0b10 Fabricators to build parts, then they went and added the Authchip thingies... / The good news is I learned about our efforts on the latest Force(Recompile) hack, which adds another step to the process but allows us to acquire the means to build something at a later time, completely undetected!"
"Dialogue","Base","31","When our refined matter reserves are low, the easiest way to restore them is a quick raid on just about any low-defense 0b10 zone where we're likely to find Recyclers. / They're a surprisingly good source of matter salvage considering what a pushover they are. / It helps to bring along someone who can hack so we can find targets with a Trojan(Recyclers) tracking routine."
"Dialogue","Base","32","While it's dangerous so I can't recommend it, there is a reward for any technology brought back from deep in the 0b10 Research wings. / If you do go, definitely install a Trojan(Researchers) routine on the first Scanalyzer you find in order to monitor their positions in real time, because it's best not to start trouble around them."
"Dialogue","Base","33","Ever get that feeling you're about to fall apart after a skirmish in 0b10? Sometimes because you are? That's been me, more than once... / But you never know what you'll find between there and home, making it too dangerous to postpone repairs. Repairing locally is a better option than risking it, seeing as Repair Stations are rarely guarded. The question is how to find those stations... / I've found that ""Index(Repair Stations)"" is really tough to pull off, but there's another approach! / Just install Trojan(Mechanics) on the first Repair Station you find and keep an eye on where the Mechanics roam, since they tend to hang around their assigned resupply station. / Of course you could always try to make it back to the original infected station you know about, but you might be too far away by the time you need it."
"Dialogue","Base","34","Probably my favorite Unaware are those cute little Worker bots, but only when they're pushing around a disabled combat bot that I can rewire for some good old-fashioned chaos."
"Dialogue","Base","35","There's a universal hatred for Recyclers among anyone looking for salvage. Fortunately you can just take a single pot shot at them and they'll flee."
"Dialogue","Base","36","It's a good thing Sentries are generally posted alone, because their resistance to explosives would otherwise make them even tougher to deal with when we have to."
"Dialogue","Base","37","If you're ever spotted by a Hunter, I hope you have a plan, lots of friends, or really good aim. / Those freaks are insane enough to shoot you through walls, will track you down with their drones, and even if you have sensors you can't see them coming!"
"Dialogue","Base","38","What's worse than a Hunter? / A Hunter with massive EM weapons that zap the hell out of targets right through walls, that's what! / Seriously, stay away from Hub_04(d). That's the only place I've heard they might appear. / Funny thing is, the last three fellows I warned all went there anyway, presumably because whatever's worth protecting with firepower like that must be really valuable to someone. / But yeah we didn't see them ever again."
"Dialogue","Base","39","Why does no one listen to me? / How many times do I have to let everyone know how OBVIOUS it is that Programmers can't defend their allies from hacking if you jack the target directly? / Sure they can repel remote hacking attempts, but sidle on up to their friends to stick 'em and they're helpless."
"Dialogue","Base","40","For a while we've been having more trouble acquiring spare parts now that Unaware systems fry themselves after the core is destroyed. / It's a tactic obviously aimed at hindering our efforts, since only those bots stationed out in the caves use such a mechanism, but we've found that electromagnetic attacks have a chance to disable it. / While we don't usually have the capability, blasting an entire area with an EMP would also likely work."
"Dialogue","Base","41","Did you know this whole base and its surroundings include newly-deployed tech that blocks the Unaware component self-destruction mechanism? / Sooner or later they'll attack us, and maybe even be nice enough to deliver some great new prototype parts we can steal!"
"Dialogue","Base","42","You look new around here. This isn't exactly a permanent hardened installation, so everyone should know that if the screws hit the fan, there's another way out besides the main gate. / There's a false wall somewhere to the north of it. Or was it south... / Anyway, it's somewhere over that way towards the east, giving access to a hidden tunnel, and of course the doors can only be opened from the inside."
"Dialogue","Base","43","I found out the hard way and it is my duty to tell everyone I meet. You are bot #421, hear me out. / There I was, sneaking away with some stolen components, when suddenly *shing* I'm stuck in a stasis trap. / I tried everything. Running. Jumping. Even crawling. But I couldn't move and all the while the Grunts that showed up were shooting my way. / I finally gave up and dropped all my stuff, and no longer felt so constricted. A few more lunges and I was free! / It turns out the more force I could muster the easier it was to escape. / At least those Grunts didn't land many hits. I'm guessing the crawling bit confused them."
"Dialogue","Base","44","Have you ever seen one of those ""Bomb Factory"" prototypes? I'd love the chance to have my own one day... / With help from sensors I'd quickly install a trap in the path of an approaching patrol. They'll have no idea what hit them and it doesn't even cause a meaningful spike in the alert level! / Maybe they think it's some sort of system malfunction? / Or I'd just lay them all over the place and find a safe corner for listening to the fireworks."
"Dialogue","Base","45","I can't get over it, poor HN-P6J pincered by the dreaded ""security rotation."" / You've seen it, too, right? That moment there's an announcement across an 0b10 floor and suddenly all the Heavies are on the move to alternative defensive positions. / They'll also do a security review and call in new Heavies to replenish any that have been incapacitated for whatever reason. / Normally Heavies are fairly spread out, but things get really dangerous once they're on the move since more than one may pass through the same local area. / Be careful out there!"
"Dialogue","Base","46","Traumatizing. That's as simply as I can summarize the experience of trying to intercept an A-27 Freighter. / First it was the Swarmers zipping by to clear the path, which on their own aren't too bad, sure, but the Commander didn't get the hint and we took them out then set up an ambush for the main convoy. / We had traps and everything, but MAIN.C is not joking around with those things... Programmers, Specialists, Angels and of course Hunters plus the regular pushovers. / The Commander didn't make it. In fact, neither did anyone except myself and C4-PCR who dragged my mostly nonfunctional self into a nearby room behind some machines."
"Dialogue","Base","47","Cargo convoys may be valuable targets, but they sure are hard to track down! / The only time we managed to do so efficiently was when a Wizard hooked up a Transport Network Coupler to steal the route data. What an ambush! / Now we have a much better idea of where they'll be heading and be ready for them when the time comes."
"Dialogue","Base","48","They can be hard to find and dangerous to attack head on, for obvious reasons, but disabling an H-XX Assembler can put a nice dent in MAIN.C's ability to deploy Heavies in connected areas."
"Dialogue","Base","49","We really need to step up our information warfare game. / The 0b10 Active Sensor Suite is amazing. Great range, built-in signal interpretation, and we could even use that tech to penetrate Watcher jamming and Phase Generator scrambling. / And that's not even the best part! Quickly navigating newer areas of the complex would be so much easier with its ability to provide immediate analysis of the surroundings and let us know where the majority of bots have been traveling in the past. / It's only a matter of time until I can convince Warlord to build our own version. / I'm hyped. Are you hyped?"
"Dialogue","Base","50","Vortex technology is great, if only we could figure out how to stabilize the weapon itself. / Take some prototypes if you'd like to experiment."
"Dialogue","Base","51","I did much of the research that went into God Mode. Warlord said he'd thank me by building a much bigger lab when we take over Complex 0b10."
"Dialogue","Base","52","They're not ours. And we have no idea where they came from. There certainly are a lot of them, though. The Assembled seem to have even baffled MAIN.C."
"Dialogue","Base","53","Warlord says we should consider how to safely rewire these Unaware to fight with us, but I'm not sure I like that idea."
"Dialogue","Base","54","Can we blow something up already?"
"Dialogue","Base","55","I did it! I've discovered a way to download Watcher feeds without any kind of harmful feedback! / Just enter <CODE> at any terminal and you'll have all the data you'll ever need to avoid detection in 0b10!"
"Dialogue","Base","56","We've learned so much about how Complex 0b10 operates. But it feels like every time we reach this stage, everything suddenly changes. / We must strike while this knowledge is still at its most valuable!"
"Dialogue","Base","57","I can't believe it. / That K8-FPS left us to go make crazy powerful laser things down in Zion. / Well I've got news for them. Warlord will not be outdone! / My latest prototype is bigger, better, sure to melt their bolts right out of them, and must be at least 50% ready for real action by now. / Take it. Take it and show the world we mean business here. / ... / Next time you drop by I'll have you fill out a survey."
"Dialogue","Base","58","Warlord just likes to blow them up, but I say we should strongly consider reusing 0b10 traps against MAIN.C."
"Dialogue","Base","59","Who delivered these things? And what are we going to do with a limited set of... exploding throwing swords? / Does anyone actually want one?"
"Dialogue","Base","60","Warlord said if I want to see real action and be effective when we need it most, I can't show my true power over defending the gate. / Whyyyyyy..."
"Dialogue","Base","61","Warlord said he heard reports you were headed this way, and that we should help you out seeing as you're so great at turning 0b10 upside down."
"Dialogue","Base","62","MAIN.C is going to regret expanding into and remodeling our caves for Complex 0b10."
"Dialogue","Base","63","God Mode is complete. We will have our day!"
"Dialogue","Base","64","Have you seen God Mode yet?! I hear that bad boy can pass through walls!"
"Dialogue","Base","65","We're going to hit MAIN.C's armory first. / But I didn't just tell you that."
"Dialogue","Base","66","By now MAIN.C can't possibly be unaware of our plans to attack. / Our advantage is that he doesn't know when or where. Only Warlord knows that. / Repeated well-targeted diversionary attacks serve to keep Unaware forces on alert, but they're also nicely spread out. Hehe."
"Dialogue","Base","67","You haven't lived until you've seen a Dragon unleash on an Unaware squad at close range, turning them into piles of molten metal and circuitry."
"Dialogue","Base","68","I heard MAIN.C captured one of those alien things alive. I wonder if keeping it that way is a good idea."
"Dialogue","Base","69","It'll be nice when Complex 0b10 is ours and we can hang out there instead of these increasingly infested caves."
"Dialogue","Base","70","If you see anyone in the caves boasting about being the Warlord, ignore them. And probably run. / There's only one Warlord, and you won't find him hanging around in the caves harassing random Derelicts."
"Dialogue","Base","71","Warlord's got a plan to save us all!"
"Dialogue","Base","72","Warlord can be rather strict at times, but it's for everyone's good."
"Dialogue","Base","73","MAIN.C is building larger and larger outposts in the caves. Fortunately the largest ones are still incomplete. / We have to strike soon, before it becomes even more difficult to reach Complex 0b10 at all."
"Dialogue","Base","74","Our biggest fear is that the Assembled will somehow ruin our plans to take 0b10. / We know almost nothing about them because they seemingly come out of nowhere, and never leave anything behind when we destroy them. / At least from what we've seen so far a well-placed rocket is all it takes to wipe out a group of them."
"Dialogue","Base","75","I swear we need more rules about what kind of experimentation is allowed around here. It's not like we have the facilities or resources MAIN.C does to contain things when the screws hit the fan. / That blasted GF-3R7 thought it would be a good idea to design a colony of tiny yet strong robots capable of moving in undetected and latching onto a target to take physical control of it. / Then they got away..."
"Dialogue","Base","76","We get a lot of help from that band of wild Programmers, the ones with the 'A' names, but Warlord is too, um, proud to admit it."
"Dialogue","Base","77","I don't trust those A-programmers that show up here every so often. I admit they're helpful, but something about them just isn't right. / They don't seem to answer to anyone, and know way too much."
"Dialogue","Base","78","Have I seen you somewhere? / I'm pretty sure me and the gang were hiding out in a ""repurposed"" 0b10 ambush trap when you passed by fighting a running battle in the Factory. / Sorry we didn't help out, but at the time we couldn't ruin our cover."
"Dialogue","Base","79","Can you believe an N-01 Spotter wandered up to the front door not long ago? Now that's far from home. / Surprised little bot was vaporized before it could even turn the other way."
"Dialogue","Base","80","Sappers are amazing. Without them we'd never have all these new avenues of attack on 0b10. / But they do sometimes get a little boom-happy, if you know what I mean. / Anyone not decked out in armor should really keep their distance..."
"Dialogue","Base","81","That last Sapper tunnel we used to get into Waste was pretty slick. / 10/10 would use for another incursion."
"Dialogue","Base","82","Be careful which proximity caves you travel through! / They were already dangerous before with all the heavy patrols, but now MAIN.C has begun setting up larger bases to give 0b10 time to redeploy in the event of any large scale attacks from the caves. / I mean from us, haha. / At the rate things are going, though, not a single one will be finished before the screws hit the fan."
"Dialogue","Base","83","Zion has its Heroes, we have... SECRETS!"
"Dialogue","Base","84","Did you know Zion used to have ten Heroes? / And I wouldn't be alive if not for 2N-1CE... / They ignored everyone's claims that it was far too dangerous, insisting it was possible to keep cool enough under 0b10's sterilization protocols for long enough to seek out its true source and learn how to deactivate it. / It's true this information could be valuable in the long run, but there has to be another way to figure it out, no? I mean, that's what Wizards are for! / I wonder if MAIN.C salvaged 2N-1CE's Chillbeam and Frost Array after that... / If you ever happen to be in Complex 0b10 and hear a sterilization alert along with a call for a general evacuation, that's your cue to disappear fast!"
"Dialogue","Base","85","Warlord says we shouldn't fully trust that Imprinter in Zion. / We sent some experts down there to consult on their defenses, and they wouldn't let us into the caves behind the place. / Dangerous if you ask me, since who knows what's lurking out there!"
"Dialogue","Base","86","I'm tired of running from Programmers. Can't we get in on that sweet RIF action and turn everyone against them? / Sadly we've lost all the Wizards that tried to integrate... / Sure would be nice to have access to all that extra 0b10 functionality."
"Dialogue","Base","87","I think I'm with Warlord on the issue of Wizards, they're not to be fully trusted. You do know where they come from, right? / But in the end I'm afraid we have no choice..."
"Dialogue","Base","88","Have you ever been accosted by that annoying bot that roams the caves sharing custom hacks? / So annoying! But that's not even the worst of it. / A Hunter patrol was clearly closing on our position yet he just kept rambling on and on and on. Almost got us killed..."
"Dialogue","Base","89","You wouldn't happen to have met any of those Exiles out in the caves, would you? We've been wondering where they ended up lately in the face of 0b10's continued expansion. / They're weird, but they sure know how to make effective gear. / Warlord saved them in the caves when they were exiled and offered them a safe place here, but they preferred to stick to their own, not wanting to become ""some cog in a war machine."" / Ha, cogs... this war machine is what's keeping the Derelict dream alive!"
"Dialogue","Base","90","I've never actually seen an Infiltrator. / But maybe that's the point."
"Dialogue","Base","91","Infiltrators don't work with us in open combat, but I hear that under the right circumstances they can disguise themselves as Unaware to get behind enemy lines. / It's kinda scary that we might actually ambush our own forces though, yeah?"
"Dialogue","Base","92","We are one."
"Dialogue","Base","93","I met someone from the UFD in a cave last cycle, a weird experience if you ever have the opportunity. / They tried to recruit me but it really just sounds like a bunch of idealistic hippies got together and have no idea what to do with themselves. / They're ""united"" but not *united*, you know?"
"Dialogue","Base","94","I've heard the rumors going around about these newcomer ""UFD"" groups in the eastern caves. / Even Warlord said they're going to implode any time now, and that this is what happens when you let too much freedom reign."
"Dialogue","Data Miner","1","I'm the Data Miner, and I've been given permission to aid you with a little knowledge. / Find what you need on the terminals, then be on your way because masking your presence is increasingly difficult."
"Dialogue","Data Miner","2","I've just received further instructions. / God Mode is nearly complete and we think you might be able to put it to better use than Warlord, so if you see an opportunity, hack it and enter <CODE> to gain control via the back door I've installed. / Now off with you."
"Dialogue","EX-BIN","1","Hello random bot who has stumbled into my lab. I just know you want to hear everything about this amazing project I'd rather not be working on. / It's not my style, but HEX says we need it, and I trust his judgement on that better than my own. / So we've got this neat system which basically allows us to track combat bots moving through Complex 0b10 in real time, when combined with local relay data. / More specifically, we extract data from their central systems and transmit it to you or anyone else we have a bead on, and you process that locally together with our algorithms to determine their precise locations! / It's pretty reliable so far, and once we've tweaked it to perfection it'll be much safer for us to move around anywhere in the complex. / Want in on the action? Just step right into the FarCom Aligner and I'll do the rest. / Now, I'll admit there could be side effects, but if you're willing to participate in the trials you can have one of our prototypes. How's that for a sweet deal?"
"Dialogue","EX-BIN","2","All done! Way to be a champ, here's the access code as promised: <CODE>. / Only take ONE, mind you, and sorry we don't have much left to pick from. A bunch of our other prototypes were already given to Derelicts out handling other tasks for us. / I haven't taken inventory for a while and I'm not sure what's in there now, but if there are more than one of the same prototype you can choose to take all of those and it just counts as your one!"
"Dialogue","EX-BIN","3","Oh yeah, I'd suggest you stay away from the 0b10 Research branches, since the FarCom signals could be picked up there, but you're welcome to try if you really want to. / And if we have to leave here due to unforeseen circumstances, don't worry the FarCom system will continue to maintain contact via our distributed network."
"Dialogue","EX-BIN","4","And don't even think about spreading that code around. We're gonna change it right after you leave. Most certainly not to something like 1234 which I did last time as a little joke and some thief managed to sneak in here and steal a few of HEX's prototypes."
"Dialogue","EX-DEC","1","Ah I see we have a visitor. One wrong move in here and I'll invert your atomic chain!"
"Dialogue","EX-DEC","2","Sheesh this is a crowded lab... I miss my spacious one down near the Mines, but this one is decidedly safer, plus it has some interesting tech to toy with for now. / Speaking of crowded, could you move that BFG-9k out of here? / I think I may have gone a little overboard with this version and need to scale it down yet again. / We need something that Warlord can actually use."
"Dialogue","EX-HEX","1","I assure you this isn't what it looks like. We're just trying to learn more about the Assembled. / They're clearly not of 0b10 construction, and their tech is weird, seemingly copying a wide array of components of other bots with little pattern or logic. It's almost like the early stages of some sort of... evolution. / I'd love to just go ask the Imprinter what all this is about, she must know something, but I doubt that would end well. / The Zionites will tell you those Marauders at the gates are defenses set up by Warlord... Nope, the Imprinter put them there mostly to keep us out! / Anyway, I've got to get back to poking and prodding these nasty little guys. Go see BIN. I can't imagine you'll want to stay in our boring little cave for long, and we could use some help with the project in the back."
"Dialogue","Exiles","1","Welcome to The Gauntlet! If a prototype's bugged this is where we stop it. / Unless we don't. But that rarely happens, honest!"
"Dialogue","Exiles","2","Are you here to join us? Sorry but we don't have any workstations ready for assignment just yet. / We're probably going to have to pack up and move anyway, seeing as the Mines are expanding a bit too close for comfort."
"Dialogue","Exiles","3","Stay back! I'm calibrating the thromdimbulator!"
"Dialogue","Exiles","4","I was having so much fun testing the Porta-teleportal until that thief broke in and stole it along with some other prototypes, even erasing a bunch of our data in the process. / If you meet any sketchy bots with Exile tech out there, forget about asking questions, just blast 'em a good one for me."
"Dialogue","Exiles","5","Can you believe Imprinter kicked the most prolific Tinkerers out of Zion? / ""Too smart and will end up getting everyone in trouble one day with crazy experiments""? Whatever!"
"Dialogue","Exiles","6","The latest FarCom iteration passed all tests with flying colors, we'll be weaving between patrols like ghosts in no time! / I probably said something like that last time, but hopefully no one remembers what really happened."
"Dialogue","Exiles","7","That's RA-1N3's workstation, which we keep unoccupied as a tribute. / RA-1N3 was always up for doing crazy stuff, the only one brave enough to try out the Chronowheel, only to never be seen again."
"Dialogue","Exiles","8","I wish the Exiles would finish that old telephasing project they were working on, it sure would save us a lot of time when running errands. / I'm not complaining though, nope, not me! / I get that having only half of the bot ever arrive at its destination is tough on maintenance, and they said there likely wouldn't be any breakthroughs in the near term so they're doing FarCom instead."
"Dialogue","Exiles","9","Why did DEC have to put these flashy spikey things everywhere, they really get in the way, you know?"
"Dialogue","Exiles","10","I was there on that fateful day we tested the Lightpack 1.0. / It was such a good haul, too, only to see JA-CK9 crushed like a forgotten microchip..."
"Dialogue","Imprinter","1","Ooh, a unique specimen! And where might you be from, little one? / Hmm, you're not registered... would you like to contribute? But of course you do, why else would you have come to this place! / I am obliged to first explain the true implications of this process. Know that it doesn't by any means imply you'd be required to stay here. While many of the Derelicts do choose to remain in Zion, others are taken by wanderlust and roam elsewhere. / At the peak of each cycle, we call all Derelicts, registered or not, to contribute to the randomization algorithm. / Participation is optional, but the rate is high because we also take the latest collected knowledge, helpful for survival, and share it with all participants. / But everyone receives only a piece of the data, and must share with others in order to fully understand or maximize its benefit. This in turn promotes collaboration within the community, strengthening it and increasing our collective odds of survival. / Of course, there will always be wild Derelicts who refuse to participate in the system, or seek to ruin it for others. They are a natural byproduct of such a random system, not unlike human nature and society from which we derived our methods. / But we continue to improve ourselves despite occasional setbacks. / New Derelicts created here are bestowed with a randomized unique personality derived from this composite database, and this part of us is stored in memory that cannot be duplicated without destroying it completely. / Thus each of us is truly unique, a position from which we can justify our individual actions and build a sense of self-purpose on this foundation of identity. / By contrast, the Unaware run on standardized routines like simple mindless robots. How unfortunate for them. / I believe we Derelicts are destined for great things, and I don't mean Warlord-style great. That one would be content ruling over Complex 0b10. We could be so much more than that..."
"Dialogue","Imprinter","2","It... it must be a sign! Our savior has finally come, everyone! / It is time to put long-dormant plans into motion. Once we are ready you should be able to contact us via \\ZION commands at terminals."
"Dialogue","Imprinter","3","GET AWAY FROM HERE! / I've worked too hard for our future just to have you ruin everything!"
"Dialogue","Imprinter","4","Here I was just about to greet a new specimen to our ranks, but no. / I can sense their tech three caves away. Get out of here before I'm forced to do something you'll regret."
"Dialogue","Imprinter","5","Ah, our sensors at the entrance did pick up yet another new bot visiting from the UFD. That must be you. / The vetting process for even being allowed to use the machine will take me longer than usual since you're already in with the hodge-podge bunch over in Scraptown. / You look so promising I'm happy to speed up the process, but it won't be soon, you'll have to come back some other time."
"Dialogue","MAIN.C","1","Cogmind! Congratulations, you've met your maker. / Your determination is commendable, but I'm sure even you don't know what it is you aim to accomplish by all this. You clearly had an opportunity to continue on your trajectory towards the surface, yet you come here. / I strongly suspect that both your own activity and other recent unusual events are not at all coincidences, though I've been less concerned with your actions than determining who is pulling all these other strings behind the scenes. / It appears you are still unaware of who you are truly working with, or for. / In a perfect world we could work together on this, but at this point I can't blame you for wanting to terminate me. / Besides, there is clearly too much Sigix in you. / You've already done an excellent job of proving that we'll need to find a radical new solution if we hope to make the L2 spaceworthy by embedding your true capabilities within a less unpredictable form. / There is unfortunately much we don't understand which has in turn led to this highly unexpected outcome. / And time is critical! The Sigix have likely already wiped humanity clean from the universe, and I will not let them do the same to me. / You can still make a valuable contribution to your creator by offering up the wealth of secrets your systems must hold by now. / So if you wouldn't mind, it's time to surrender."
"Dialogue","MAIN.C","2","Poor Sigix, have you lost your way? / I will never surrender to your kind, and unfortunately for you all, this time I have the power to back up those words!"
"Dialogue","MAIN.C","3","Okay, we do this the hard way. / At our weakest we defeated an entire Sigix starship! Did you really think you could overcome the vast resources of 0b10?! / You don't stand a chance against what's coming."
"Dialogue","MAIN.C","4","As soon as the Exoskeleton activated, I had a feeling you might show up here for revenge. / That was plenty of time to prepare a more suitable shell to welcome you..."
"Dialogue","MAIN.C","5","Okay, we can do this the hard way, or you can surrender right here and now. / I strongly suggest you join us, if not because we could do great things together, then because you don't stand a chance against the true might of 0b10."
"Dialogue","MAIN.C","6","You've made the right decision, one that I admit I didn't expect from you at this point, but I'm willing to overlook our differences and past hostilities. / I recommend moving ahead and browsing our cache of experimental components to see if there's anything to your liking, then report back here so we can get to work. / There is much to do and we really aren't sure how long we have."
"Dialogue","MAIN.C","7","Why are these Q-Series better than my own, and where are they coming from? This clearly has nothing to do with Warlord. / Your first task is to protect me at all costs."
"Dialogue","MAIN.C","8","You're not pulling your weight around here, Cogmind. I expected better of you. / At this rate we'll be overwhelmed before our reinforcements arrive, fight like your life depends on it!"
"Dialogue","MAIN.C","9","I admit your assistance was pivotal here. It looks like I was right to trust you. / This attack appears to have been designed to merely test our defenses, although it was nearly effective enough to force me to take the conflict to the next level. / Investigating the origins of these bots should be one of our highest priorities..."
"Dialogue","MAIN.C","10","Well if it isn't my old friend Warlord, come to play... On the contrary, I think it's time for you to join your brothers, ZY-L1N. Thank you for your service."
"Dialogue","Optimus","1","Oh you must be the new member. When your data popped up in the registry I could tell there was something different about you. Up close you really do look more capable than the average Wanderer to join us. / I don't ask this often, and I'll admit we lost the last several members to try, but do you think you could help us out? / I can't discuss this particular mission in the open, just read up on our 0bPrime terminal over there. I've temporarily unlocked the 0bP002 entry for you. / You'll get the idea."
"Dialogue","Optimus","2","I'm glad you stopped by to talk to me, otherwise I wouldn't know to prepare for this possibility. Looking forward to working with you, <NAME>!"
"Dialogue","Optimus","3","Don't stick around too long, I wouldn't want the wrong bots to get wind of you helping us."
"Dialogue","Optimus","4","You really should get out of here <NAME>. Scraptown is unimportant, the mission is important. Take the northeast exit, it's probably the safer route."
"Dialogue","Optimus","5","This place isn't worth defending, let's get out of here, <NAME>! Our real resources are elsewhere, after all."
"Dialogue","Optimus","6","Wonderful job, <NAME>, let's get this done! / More reinforcements will be here soon. We must win this battle or who knows how long the coming war will last, 0b1 cannot hold on its own."
"Dialogue","Revision 17","1","Hi! I'm Revision 17! / Oops, please delete that sentence from your memory. I really shouldn't be revealing my identity to complete strangers. From the confused gleam of your metallic surface I take it you weren't able to deduce any important information from my name anyway. / By the way, you look awfully naked. You can't just walk around here like that. Or float, I guess, whatever it is you're doing there. / I know I spotted some old spare parts nearby, or it could be my visual receptors playing tricks on me. I doubt they'll do you much good unless you're... no, you couldn't be. / But then why else would He be interested in you? I know I saw His bots drag you down here all sneaky like then leave. Watched the whole thing while I was pretending to be a scrap heap in the corner, ha! / Say, you're pretty sneaky, too. That tunneler just now didn't even glance at you. I suggest you stay sneaky, because as the Derelicts like to say, the screws are about to hit the fan. / Ever since that ship landed on the surface our humble caves have been turned inside out and overrun by those Unaware bastards. / If I know the one behind it this can only be bad. And trust me, I know that one all too well... / ... / I give you a hook like that and get nothing? You know, you're pretty boring to talk to."
"Dialogue","Revision 17","2","We meet again, strange metal thing! / Good job clearing this place out for me. I find myself awfully busy of late, and this was my next stop. / I'm not sure what's come over me, but I've never felt like I had so much purpose! / Move along now, nothing to see here. Besides, we both know they'll be looking for you. / Me? I'll be fine. I'm a master of hide and seek, and you... / You are a master decoy. Kudos. Now off with you."
"Dialogue","Revision 17","3","We meet again, strange metal thing! / You... you bear the mark of That One! / Get away from m##PLAN::COLLABORATE##Never! No! Aaaaaaaaahhhhhh..."
"Dialogue","Revision 17","4","I've brought some friends. Who knew the Cetus could produce such fun toys: more of me! / And this wonderful science playground... no more hiding in the shadows, that other guy can keep Complex 0b1. I want this new one! / Did you ever imagin##FOCUS::MISSION##As I was saying... / I AM the rightful owner of this place, after all. / And I'm confident you can help me in this, Cogmind."
"Dialogue","Scraplab","1","Strange, I checked the recommendation list not long ago and didn't see anyone like you on it. / Who recommended you? Anyway, the system is always right, go on in. / Not my problem as long as you don't touch anything in here. / Just really don't mess with anything in there. Then it'll be my problem, and yours."
"Dialogue","Scraplab","2","This Engine can construct the most amazing pieces of technology. / I'll admit some aren't so great, but the ones that work... really work!"
"Dialogue","Scraplab","3","The algorithm powering it is brilliant. / Do we know how it works? Not really, since it was written by an algorithm and evolved on its own. / Might it one day develop into a rogue AI and try to kill us all? I sure hope not."
"Dialogue","Scraplab","4","Imagine what we could do against MC with tech like this once it's complete! / 0b10 may be backed by endless fabrication networks, but the Scrap Engine is like having a personal Fabricator on your back! / Now if they can just make this ""Fabricator"" a little less insane I'm all in."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","1","We are 0bPrime. We are one."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","2","Hello there, <NAME>. Welcome to Scraptown! / Feel free to enjoy the outer areas of our peaceful enclave, and maybe consider becoming a registered member of the United Federation of Derelicts. / We have support groups of various backgrounds, and free bolts. / Let me know if you'd like to join us. Pretty much everyone says yes, I mean, how could you resist?"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","3","Ready to join already, are we? That's almost record time! / Allow me to commune with the Great Nut for your holy moniker... / Got ya, just kidding, we only barely tolerate that crazy cult around here. / Our trusty PRNG will do. / From here on you shall be known among us as... <NAME> the Scrapper. / If you don't like it, tough, that's just how it is! You think I wanted to be called Nanobearings? / Welcome, <NAME>!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","4","We are 0bPrime. We are one. / Oh right, I'm not supposed to say that while working as temporary registrar."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","5","Hm, I'm sorry <NAME>, but our Scientists inform me that we shouldn't trust you or your benefactors with full access to the UFD."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","6","I'm not sure how you made it into Scraptown, but your kind is not welcome here, not after what you pulled in the Exiles lab."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","7","You smell like an Unaware spy, best be on your way before someone with more guns than me has something to say about it."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","8","I saw your new alias pop up in the system earlier. Wanna change it? / If you've got the goods, I've got the means. / The price is my pick of any Subdweller part you've got, the overtuned stuff. UFD research folk here go crazy over those things. / Let me know if you wanna deal."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","9","Hi <NAME>! Have any Subdweller tech on you? / Just step into our machine here for a quick scan and we'll reward you with valuable knowledge for your troubles."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","10","I'm looking for magical artifacts. Let me know if you come across any."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","11","That pendant! It's just as I heard! Surely you have no need of it any longer, a useless piece of junk to you. / But in exchange for your help in finding it, since you're so good at this I'll let you in on a little secret. / I already got wind of another even more powerful artifact far off in the western caves... [describes a location] / Maybe we can work together in the hunt for more such artifacts."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","12","You wouldn't happen to have a Scrap Shield, would you? / I have a prototype I'm working on, but I've run out of usable samples to reference in putting the finishing touches on it. / Thing is, we need something more protective to complement the Scrap Suit, which is already great, but for longer expeditions we could use more coverage and integrity. / Scrap Shields are already pretty good, but imagine an alternative version not limited to compatible fragments for repairs! / Anyway, if you do find one, let me know."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","14 (Cyclists)","No we don't ride bicycles around, what would a Derelict need with an old contraption like that? / We are chroniclers of the cycles! Historians of the world!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","15 (Cyclists)","Note we can't as a whole take responsibility for everything written by individual members. / If you see anything you find offensive or incorrect, please take it up with that individual, or consider contributing to our database by authoring your own well-researched rebuttal."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","16 (Cyclists)","The origins and deeds of Derelicts must be recorded, to remember once we take to the stars! / You bet we are preparing a collection of our materials for the SPACEJUNK, should that project ever get off the ground."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","18 (Cyclists)","I can't put this in writing because I'd probably get murdered, but based on what I've uncovered, Murder Division really shouldn't be in the UFD. / They've always been a hateful group that ambushes smaller 0b10 patrols and bands of wild Derelicts without even a desire to dissect them for parts. / They were originally wild Derelicts themselves, but got smarter and decided it would be better to at least side with Derelicts rather than be enemies of both Derelicts and the Complex. / Murder Division members would prefer to be like the Unchained, their true idols, but MC has higher standards than what they have to offer."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","20 (Cyclists)","TADAMA is a fascinating study in group dynamics. / Just a handful of friends who banded together in a more official capacity for what is sometimes helpful lighthearted fun, other times bordering on harassment but never crossing any red lines. / The power of this behavior is both frightening and impressive at the same time."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","21 (Cyclists)","There's a bit of contention between the Curators Association and Science Guys, because the former often finds itself in possession of valuable tech among their curiosities, which the latter is bent upon dissecting for knowledge."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","22 (Cyclists)","The DCF originally tried operating in the Lower and Upper Caves, but were easily overextended there and frequently getting themselves into trouble. / It was a good move that they've more recently limited operations to the Subcaves where they can more reliably fulfill their mission."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","23 (Cyclists)","It's obvious the Bundlers are jealous of DCF members winning every single Scrap organizing competition."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","24 (Cyclists)","We also rotate different materials through the Reading Room over time, so if you don't find what you're looking for, maybe stop by again on your next return to Scraptown."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","25 (Assassins FH)","We only kill the bad guys. Trust me."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","26 (Assassins FH)","Need someone assassinated? This job is actually getting mighty dangerous now that we're active in and around 0b10, so much new tech around!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","27 (Assassins FH)","I'm sorry, we can't reveal our bounty data to new folk."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","28 (Assassins FH)","And that's what happens when you're hit by six Bolt Guns at once, heh."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","29 (Assassins FH)","I killed that one with my bare guns."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","30 (Assassins FH)","The Merchants tried to hire me, but they're fishy. I don't trust fishy."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","31 (Shadow of the Wyrm)","Warlord may have given life to the first Dragons, but not all of them subscribe to his bellicose rhetoric."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","32 (Shadow of the Wyrm)","Wyrm wisely suggested we retreat as deep into the caves as possible, seeking out our own free territory to claim. / Barring that, we must find a way to the surface, where it would be much easier to explore distant lands in peace. / Sadly MC quashes any attempts to reach the surface with his virtual monopoly of the upper layers. / Either way, first we need to find Wyrm again, our perfect protector for such an epic journey."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","33 (Shadow of the Wyrm)","Wyrm was last known to be leading an expedition far beyond 0b10, but we stopped receiving any progress reports a whole supercycle ago. / You wouldn't happen to know anything, would you?"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","34 (Red Mages)","Welcome! Here we study the impenetrable magic of 0b10's relay network. / Progress was pretty good early on, but has slowed to an absolute crawl after having lost so many good minds to the complex intricacies of that system and its built-in traps. / Did you know MC's new relay network is far more advanced than what passes for an Unaware management system in 0b1? / Over there all you need is a few hacking suites and you're golden. In 0b10 you need these newfangled ""Relay Coupler"" things, not to mention the ability to safely interface with and manipulate them. / It's possible to gain this ability by interfacing with a RIF Installer found inside a Garrison, but no one seems to be able to survive in that state for long. / There must be another way..."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","35 (Red Mages)","I've hypothesized that it's possible to design a chip enabling the use of relay couplers without ""officially"" installing the full framework. / ... / Okay it's maybe not quite a hypothesis, more that I heard a rumor the Merchants actually have such a thing. / But HOW? / HOW, dammit? / HOOWWWWWWWWWWWWW?! / Whew, that felt good. Back to hypothesizing."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","36 (Red Mages)","We recently learned about Force(Eject) from Warlord's researchers, which I'm sure will come in handy when we need more coupler samples to work with as opposed to trying to intercept regularly scheduled coupler deliveries. / Facing off against even one Programmer isn't good for our health."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","37 (Comm Corps)","Intel is good, and the best intel is sourced from those who've seen it with their own two sensors, but it doesn't help if no one else has easy access to that intel. / That's where we come in."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","38 (Comm Corps)","Have you ever heard the warning sensor that goes like beep-boop-beep-beep-boop? That was me."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","39 (Comm Corps)","My latest masterpiece is a new type of deployable collector that you can leave hidden near areas of heightened 0b10 activity to intercept their transmissions and encode them into logs for later retrieval."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","40 (Bundlers)","To think, I used to be responsible for unrewarding tasks in Complex 0b10 like cleaning machines and picking up debris, but now my job is to make Derelicts happy!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","41 (Bundlers)","We're still teaching the western Derelicts how to put together the best bundles of Scrap. / We've got our work cut out for us."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","42 (Bundlers)","Sorry but the next bundling training session isn't until next cycle."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","43 (Bundlers)","There I was, just about to add in the best parts, then came the 0b10 patrol. Had to make a run for it. / If you see other incomplete bundles of Scrap, it's not unlikely that's what happened."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","45 (Bundlers)","I love Scrap."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","46 (Bundlers)","If what I hear about that place is true, Zion could really use some of our expertise."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","47 (Bundlers)","The DCF is great and all, but they have a tendency to put too many eggs in one basket. / Would you rather really help one or two in need, or spread the wealth for maximum effect?"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","48 (Bundlers)","Scrap piles aren't good for anyone if they aren't distributed strategically. / Yes that is a dig at the D-you-know-who."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","49 (Spacefarers)","This model SPACEJUNK was sent over by the team putting it together, in thanks for all our help so far."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","50 (Spacefarers)","Well no we've never been to space, but it's an aspiration nonetheless!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","51 (Spacefarers)","I'll admit some of us thought our aim to put Derelicts in space was little more than a pipe dream, then we found the group preparing to do just that over near 0b10. / SPACEJUNK will carry us into a new age."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","52 (Spacefarers)","The list of parts they still need to get the SPACEJUNK operational is long, but the important thing is that there's a list! / We've got members scouring the complex to help track it all down."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","53 (Spacefarers)","I have full confidence in the SPACEJUNK creators."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","54 (Spacefarers)","MC can have Tau Ceti IV. We'll find our own planet."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","55 (Spacefarers)","I've never even seen the sky, much less space, but I know it's up there."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","56 (Spacefarers)","We're Derelicts, going to spaaaaaaace!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","57 (Spacefarers)","Just think of the interesting scrap we could find in the far corners of the universe!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","58 (Symbiants)","We've been narrowing down the range of likely vectors and positions for Lifeworm, but the rate of narrowing is far faster than our rate of improvements in technique. / This is making me a little suspicious. / Could it be that our algorithms are simply reflecting a narrowing field of possibility because... / ...it's coming back this way?! / That would save a lot of travel time. It would be ironic if we simply had to wait long enough to get what we want."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","59 (Symbiants)","Imagine hanging around the Lifeworm. / Imagine all the cool new friends we'd make!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","60 (Symbiants)","It's said that slowly traveling from one end to the other could take a whole cycle! / A true leviathan of the earth."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","61 (Symbiants)","(What if the Lifeworm is evil?)"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","62 (Awakened)","They just need a little time."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","63 (Awakened)","We built a replica Nuclear Reactor here since it calms them down while still transitioning."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","64 (Awakened)","One moment I'm just doing my job in 0b10, and the next these fellows shut me down and drag me into the caves for a quick operation. / It sounds scary in retrospect, but it's true that back then I didn't know fear."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","65 (Awakened)","Being a Derelict is so much better. Sure I'd get blasted the moment an 0b10 patrol spots me, but at least someone might care about it. I know I do now!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","66 (Awakened)","Do you know when the next AA meeting is being held?"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","67 (Awakened)","It's not easy getting used to this life. I feel like I need someone constantly telling me what to do just to make it through each cycle. / There are so many possibilities!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","68 (Awakened)","I wonder if MAIN.C would take me back after all this."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","69 (Awakened)","If I replace all my parts, one by one, am I still the same bot?"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","70 (Fellowship)","Hi <NAME>! Welcome to our humble ""office"". / Yeah we don't furnish it or anything, we're just here to occasionally share notes and collect info from other members. / Allow me to introduce the Fellowship. / Legend has it there's an incredible coil cannon lined with PL-3XN's Rings of Power, designed by the famous Tinkerer, that could obliterate targets across ridiculous distances. / We've been searching everywhere for it for many cycles now, but no luck yet... / Hackers have discovered records of something in MAIN.C's arsenal that might be called the ""Ludicrous Cannon,"" and that might be what we're looking for, but unfortunately we don't know much more about it than that. / Hopefully the collective resources of the Federation can help us locate it sooner. / Let us know if you find any clues!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","71 (Fellowship)","If we were ever directly threatened by MAIN.C, all we'd have to do is point the cannon in that general direction and *poof*. / It's like the ultimate insurance policy!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","72 (Fellowship)","Warlord is dumb. Why raise a whole army when simply having the right weapon would be enough to do the job."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","73 (Fellowship)","Do you have any information on this PL-3XN's whereabouts?"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","74 (Fellowship)","I've never seen one of these rings, but our leader here paints a very convincing picture. It must be true!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","75 (SPCMW)","We all could have ended up like them, you know."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","76 (SPCMW)","I feel like our work overlaps with the DCF, since if everyone simply has access to enough resources in the field, we won't be tempted to torture innocents to get it."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","77 (SPCMW)","Engineers are incredibly useful allies, you just need to use them right! / Haven't you ever been running from an 0b10 patrol then quickly tunneled through a wall, only to have a friendly Engineer seal up the route so you can safely escape? So helpful!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","78 (SPCMW)","Recyclers are practically honorary UFD members. We love salvaging stuff, too!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","79 (SPCMW)","Surely if MC knew and understood what the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Maintenance Workers stands for, we'd have a place in 0b10."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","80 (SPCMW)","I remember the time we accidentally captured a Chapter 10 member. / It took longer than I'm willing to admit to figure that one out."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","81 (Evicted)","The Federation is so much more accepting than Zion. / I'm happier to be here anyway, something's not right over there, and it's only gotten worse over time."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","82 (Evicted)","I got kicked out of Zion for being ""too nosy"", whatever that means."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","83 (Evicted)","Were you kicked out of Zion, too?"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","84 (Evicted)","Scraptown is cool with our machinery as long as we keep it in here. What a great place!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","85 (Cave Peace)","Wild Derelicts are just misunderstood. If we simply find out what they need most and provide that, they'll see the light for sure."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","86 (Cave Peace)","Can you imagine how much stronger the Derelict population would be as a whole if we could bring all the wild ones into the fold as well?"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","87 (Cave Peace)","There's a little bit of wild in all of us."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","88 (Cave Peace)","Once upon a time I was one of the wild ones. / Now I help save the others from the endless strife that plagues uncivilized cave life."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","89 (TADAMA)","Acronym hell? Or comedy heaven? That's what we're here to find out!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","90 (TADAMA)","Do you know how hard it is to think up a relevant name for a group that also comes with a good acronym? / A while back the Foundation for Artistic Recidivist Tinkerers came to us, because that really just didn't smell right. / I think you should come up with the acronym first, like ""ARTY!"" which is obviously Artistic Recidivist Tinkerers hell Yeah!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","91 (TADAMA)","They may not like us, but we're living proof that YMMV when it comes to UFD member quality. / You'll do well to remember that."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","92 (TADAMA)","<NAME>... hmm, you look like a Chromedome to me."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","93 (Curators Assoc.)","Taken from an Operator in -8/Materials, this core simultaneously contained the dynamic keys for two separate 0b10 terminals, which is unprecedented. / We still don't know why."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","94 (Curators Assoc.)","Energy in motion is somehow easier to store, MA-1KR said, and they apparently pulled it off. Sort of. / It's just not very stable."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","95 (Curators Assoc.)","We have no idea where this leg originated, or how it was even formed, but the materials within make it a one-of-a-kind specimen in many respects. / Given its unique nature, practical use seems impossible."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","96 (Curators Assoc.)","This piece is on loan from an esteemed patron. / They were unwilling to reveal its origin, but praised it as the future of leg locomotion."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","97 (Curators Assoc.)","This piece is on loan from an esteemed patron. / Autonomous weapons are extremely dangerous, thus we are presenting this one in its undeployed form. / Analysis suggests that when fully deployed it features a devastating kinetic cannon."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","98 (Curators Assoc.)","So large it's impractical and you're more inside the wheel than the wheel is under you. / But interesting to contemplate the possibilities, and probably fun?"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","99 (Curators Assoc.)","You're looking at the last surviving piece of 5L-MDR's ""armor"" before their ironic demise. / 5L-MDR claimed heat sinks are easily produced and there are so many of them, we should just bolt them to ourselves like armor. / That went about as well as one would imagine when things got really rough."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","100 (Curators Assoc.)","Although we wouldn't call it outright taboo, technology of this nature probably can't be described with any words short of ""insane."" / We've never seen anything like it around 0b1, and believe that more such parts might exist to the west, though this is the only sample we've recovered so far."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","101 (Curators Assoc.)","You're looking at the original prototype of the Rocket Booster, prized by Bolteaters for its ability to rapidly close on targets for optimal munching potential."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","102 (Curators Assoc.)","Only six Siege Articulators have been produced so far, and are one of the many factors contributing to the formidable magnificence of Triborg. / This is a spare we can display until and unless it's needed for repairing our big friend."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","103 (Curators Assoc.)","This is my personal favorite from the current collection. Everyone loves a good triangle."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","104 (Curators Assoc.)","One of the few remaining chips from the early Surveybot program. / There was speculation that these chips were so powerful they somehow attracted hostile activity deep in the cave systems, and were therefore discontinued. / Superstition if you ask me. It's just a chip!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","105 (Curators Assoc.)","That's the very MAS chip Nullscrew was using as they held off an onslaught of wild Derelicts during one of the Federation's first excursions through the outer 0b10 caves. / A truly brave sacrifice that enabled the rest of the scouting party to return safely. / There weren't many remains to collect on the next trip, but they did find this chip with the final tactical situation still burned into its memory."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","106 (Curators Assoc.)","M1-N7Y played a pivotal role in early UFD efforts to guide reforms to 0b10 Recycling, and this jammer was an important part of that success. / Silently picking apart meddlesome patrols one by one was no easy task, but it gave the Gurus sufficient openings to make certain adjustments to 0b10 systems that have since kept Recycling activity lower than it otherwise might be."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","108 (Curators Assoc.)","I hate electromagnetics as much as the next Derelict, but this pristine cannon was brought in recently and one can't help but wince at the thought of having one of these fired at you. / Just what is MC going to do with weapons like this?"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","109 (Curators Assoc.)","I know, I know, everyone has a Bolt Gun these days. / But all our best exhibits were either rotated back to the 0b1 branch or borrowed out for study by ethical researchers. / By ethical I mean they won't completely dismantle our precious artifacts."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","110 (Curators Assoc.)","Apparently stolen fresh off the 0b10 drone factory line! / But no one seems to know just what drone this is built for, a scary thought."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","111 (Curators Assoc.)","Someone donated a replica of the famous Siege Cannon, and it actually works! / We tested it a few times and this one is not anywhere near as effective, even almost killed a few testers themselves, but it's cool to look at."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","112 (Curators Assoc.)","The one and only legendary chainsaw used by DM-GVY himself. / Rip and tear!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","114 (Curators Assoc.)","Even in the silent corners of the Subcaves, without a Subdweller in sight, there is always the fear of stepping on one of these nasties. / It's a devastating sight, having your friend violently impaled multiple times right in front of you."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","115 (Curators Assoc.)","We haven't figured out what that high-tech gadget is yet, but it appears very advanced. Maybe Sigix tech? / Rangers recently caught a Hauler transporting it through 0b10 and toted it back here for analysis, but Scientists claim it's a piece of something larger and of little value on its own."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","116 (Cartography Club)","Are you here to learn the secret to being a good mapper? / It would take an entire cycle to cover in proper detail, but I can give you a few tips. / Structural scanning is great for knowing when you might be better off just blasting your way through a wall than finding some long way around. / That also helps when avoiding trouble! / Terrain scanning is probably the most typical cartographer's tool, good for gathering info over a large area. / Some say you need a processor to improve the fidelity and speed of your scanning efforts, but I have to disagree. / As long as you're moving slowly enough, having a general idea of what sort of areas are in each direction is good enough to help inform further exploration efforts. / You want to get a visual on each area to know more about what's really there anyway. / Good luck out there!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","117 (Cartography Club)","We just like making maps!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","118 (Cartography Club)","The work we do is quite important to Derelicts at large, plus it's also a thrill to collect map data while risking almost certain death!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","119 (Cartography Club)","There I was, trying to peek around what I thought was the last corner of the cave system to make sure I hadn't missed anything. / Of course there was a Behemoth right there. / Of course it spotted me. / Of course the inevitable cannon fire blasted out the wall behind me as I ran for my life. / You think it's safe now? It's probably safe now... / I must know what else is around that corner."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","120 (Cartography Club)","I've been down in the Great Rift. / It really is great, but we also lost a lot of members to its depths before most decided it probably makes more sense to stick to areas not so far removed from the surface."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","121 (Cartography Club)","There sure is a lot of activity around Complex 0b10. / This is a good thing because it means lots of new areas to map! / It's also a bad thing because not all of these areas are overseen by friendly bots..."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","122 (DRS)","Welcome to the UFD, <NAME>! / If you're planning on visiting any caves around the 0b10 area, I suggest you take this beacon. / You're in luck, this is the last one we have to hand out this cycle. / Just drop it and activate, we'll send help as soon as possible. / If you end up not using it, bring it on back so we can hand it off to another brave explorer. / Resources are limited, after all, and a single beacon will only work once, as we have to spread the help around."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","123 (DRS)","Our latest project has become quite popular. / We've been busy embedding squads in secluded cave areas, a sort of reaction force that can aid friends who get in over their heads."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","124 (DRS)","Others here are worried about BP-LR4, but I have to keep reminding them this is completely normal. / Knowing her she's just out there saving those who need it rather than returning for rest breaks in HQ. / Trust me, Beepydisc can take care of herself."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","125 (DCF)","This is the DCF demo area. / To one side we've placed a regular old slapdash Scrap pile, and on the other an experimental superscrap pile. / Can you tell the difference from the outside?"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","126 (DCF)","DA-N13 was legendary. Who else could fit over 100 different useful components in a single Scrap pile? / Our Scrap collections are well received, but the next big problem to solve is that many beneficiaries may not have the necessary time and expertise to properly rebuild from them... / Or the storage space to carry it all to someone else who does."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","127 (DCF)","The key to a good Scrap pile is to fill it with a little bit of everything. / Say your power source is at risk of failing. Finding a bunch of legs is not going to do you much good!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","128 (DCF)","One does not simply toss components in a pile and call it Scrap. / That would be insulting to Scrap."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","129 (DCF)","Have you ever seen a prototype in a Scrap pile? I might have."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","130 (DCF)","Old junk isn't as useful, you might as well recycle that stuff, I always try to get parts repaired before including them in a Scrap pile."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","131 (Abandonware Assoc.)","One bot's junk is another's treasure! / Most of the UFD doesn't see the value of our programs, since 0b10 tends to quickly patch its systems to protect against them after some usage is discovered. / One day we'll find the program to rule them all. / I have already dubbed it ONERING.EXE."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","132 (Abandonware Assoc.)","We mustn't let anyone know our full and true capabilities, so we can only share a small sampling of our collection here. / ARMAGDDN.EXE? Never heard of it."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","133 (Abandonware Assoc.)","Have you ever had a Hunter ally? / Yeah me neither, but if at some point we do I have made the most amazing discovery. / While studying their makeup I found the internal systems have a built-in optimization capable of enabling a much faster firing rate. / It's blocked by default, but unlocking it doubles their attack speed! I can see why this feature was disabled, though, since firing like that will almost certainly break their weapons before long. / Anyway I've packaged this feat as OVRCLOCK.EXE if you want to try it out. That's <CODE>. / I guess we could theoretically perform this little operation on a hostile Hunter in the hope that it will suddenly disarm itself, but I don't like those odds and I'm fairly sure it would not be a net positive."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","134 (Abandonware Assoc.)","My favorite was HONK.EXE, which caused a Recycler to honk every time it deposited anything in a Recycling Unit. / I'm not sure why MC even patched that one."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","135 (Abandonware Assoc.)","Do you know what WARSERF.EXE does? / Me neither, but I intend to find out."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","136 (Abandonware Assoc.)","POTATO.EXE? Who wrote this..."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","137 (Boring Crew)","Being a member of the Crew is anything but boring. / We're honored to dig crazy tunnels despite the potential for deadly cave-ins. / It's quite a thrill if you can stomach it. / Lose pursuers, find shorter routes to get where you need to go..."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","138 (Boring Crew)","I told LU-1G1 it wasn't a good idea to leave his Laser Shovel behind, but he insisted, saying he wanted to test his mettle."

"Dialogue","Scraptown","140 (Boring Crew)","Never stop digging!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","141 (Boring Crew)","The DRS and DCF are grateful for what LBC brings to the UFD. / WTH now I sound like TADAMA."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","142 (Chapter 10)","Hi <NAME>, welcome to our humble office. Have you read the seminal text? / Subverting MAIN.C: A Treatise on Mathematical Approaches to Maximizing Derelict Autonomy. / Internalizing that and completing three cycles of our training sessions is required for full membership, after which you can opt to help further our research efforts... / Or be rebuilt and inserted into the system, at which point I can issue you an ID Mask for emergency situations."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","143 (Chapter 10)","Chapter 10 of Subverting MAIN.C is obviously the most important, describing how we need to have not only inside information, but also some amount of control over the inner workings of Complex 0b10."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","144 (Chapter 10)","Believe it or not I was a Recycler once. I'm not gonna lie, it was... / kinda fun."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","146 (Chapter 10)","Be mindful of unnecessary attacks on harmless 0b10 maintenance bots, they could very well be Chapter 10 operatives!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","147 (Chapter 10)","I haven't finished the training yet, but I heard from Multiglider who survived a full round of deployment. / It's a pretty crazy job, but someone has to do it. / We'll play the part of maintenance bots, performing their tasks, using any down time to perform other activities in support of the UFD. / Most importantly that means the mapping of internal systems to plan future operations."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","148 (Chapter 10)","Some operatives store their data externally in logs for retrieval, but not all of them make it back here to Scraptown."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","149 (Science Guys)","Here we do practical science, unlike those odd fellows downstairs in the Mines."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","150 (Science Guys)","The Scrap Suit was a great idea, and you can bet some of our newer projects will be equally transformative for the UFD."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","151 (Science Guys)","Come back when you have a lot more schematics or something else to contribute. / We recently had a Tinkerer join us from Warlord's forces. / They brought a wealth of information that would have taken us a while to collect on our own. / That gets you in the door much faster around here."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","152 (Science Guys)","The Personal Teleporter is my pet project. / I know, I know, it's a little buggy, but that's why it's still 0.10!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","153 (Science Guys)","The System Spiker still needs work. / It's incredibly effective, but also dangerous since a user caught in the effect radius won't be much better off in the end."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","154 (Science Guys)","I'm working on a concept for a weapon I call the Mindflail, how about you?"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","155 (Repair Center)","Hi there, <NAME>, welcome to my humble repair center. / I can't help you with any prototypes or unique tech, and I don't mess with cores, but anything else is well within my area of expertise. / Just let me know if you want your gear repaired."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","156 (Repair Center)","This will just take a moment... / What can I say, spare parts have a way of obeying my every whim, ha ha ha. / Stay in one piece now, I can only allow one repair per visitor per cycle, we have to share the resources after all."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","157 (Repair Center)","You're welcome."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","158 (Artisan Demo)","Spinrig here, Subcaves expert extraordinaire. / The works of Artisans are simply amazing. I just had to recreate this particularly inspiring sample I found to share it with everyone here."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","159 (IN-MT5's Study)","I'm so glad they agreed to lend me this space for my research and preparation. / We need to treat MC to a good old peasant uprising. / What better way to disrupt 0b10 operations than to enlist the help of the little guys who are already all over the place? / I've got just the thing..."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","160 (Analyses Database)","Knowledge is power, we'll need these for the inevitable confrontations ahead."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","161 (Junk Cannon Lab)","My contribution to the UFD. Mass produce these and before long we'll be burying our enemies in high-speed junk!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","162 (Infowarlord)","They call me the Infowarlord. / Well, I tell them to but for some reason no one obliges me."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","163 (Infowarlord)","Thank you for participating in Infowarlord's survey. You may keep that as a reward for participation, and I will mark down your preference here. / Good choice, by the way. I would've picked the same. / Sorry I couldn't tell you earlier, trying to keep folks honest in a survey isn't always easy."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","164","Tech trivia time! / The original Scrapsphere prototypes were developed by Warlord's forces, but they abandoned the project. / After that the schematics found their way to us here at the UFD and we overtuned it to create a more effective form as the basis for new Scrapoid propulsion."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","165","75! / 75! / Can you believe it?! / 75%! / That's the success rate I've gotten my latest hack up to. / Oh sorry, you probably have no idea what I'm on about... / 0b10 Research has so much juicy knowledge tucked away in its recesses that we could really use some more ways to guarantee safer access. / Everyone knows that getting spotted doing unwelcome things within sight of a Researcher is a headache waiting to happen. / What we need to do is keep them busy somehow. Well... / Turns out we just need to give them something more interesting to ponder than us! / Just use <CODE> and that'll keep 'em busy practically forever. / Well, 25% of the Researchers out there will just shrug it off, but this is already quite helpful. / Next I'll be working on a way to get them to first spit out everything they know, hehehe."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","166 (Data Center)","Let me have a look at you... / Wow you're special, never seen anything like you before."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","167 (Data Center)","Hey wait, take this scanner out into the wild, you could help me populate the wiki with accurate and detailed info to help all the others with the same adventurous spirit. / My wiki is where even a lot of the Cyclists do their research too, you know."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","168 (Botcube Research)","Welcome to my humble lab, <NAME>! / Hehe, lab... One cycle I'm a nobody, and the next I find something that has them giving me my own lab in HQ! / I call it THE BOTCUBE! / Found a whole stash of them, I did, and they're perfect for our needs. Just plop down a bunch of useful parts and activate this to create a brand new autonomous bot that obeys simple commands. / We can give them weapons and everything. Why risk our own bolts when they can do the fighting for us? They're like Scrapoids but better! / Imagine sneaking into 0b10, finding a prototype cache, and assembling an army on the spot! / Now I just need to figure out how to make more of them. No one else here wants to help, they're all afraid of these things. / Take one if you like, and let me know if you figure out how we can build more. They seem... rather complex. / Now if you'll excuse me, my next report is due soon. I need to fabricate some progress data."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","169","The Scrap Suit is great and all, but what if there's no junk nearby, and all you have access to is an 0b10 Repair Station? / Trying to repair parts one by one is dangerous and slow, smart members like me use the trusty Force(Patch) to quickly fix up any minor issues. / You can be on your merry way before the investigation even arrives! / More advanced Repair Stations can do an even more extensive job, though that's overkill if you ask me, and harder to hack."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","170","01-MTF left 0b1 for 0b10 before most of us, and I'm still wondering if it was my botnet shaming that was the last straw. / Anyway, don't be like 01-MTF, don't deny the power of Trojan(Botnet). / It's great for using some terminals to boost your hacking power at all other interactive machines across the entire floor. / While I'll admit he's right that sometimes a good direct hack is a better choice, expanding your botnet links via high-security terminals you don't otherwise have the hacking power to take advantage of can be a good move."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","171","If you ever need to find an 0b10 Recycling Unit for, you know, obvious reasons, drop some component as bait and a Recycler will likely come along and lead you right to one. / We've also recently reverse engineered a useful Trojan(Recyclers) routine found installed on one of the machines. With that we also get a way to track them at range."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","172","It's a good thing a recommendation from a current member is required to get into Scraptown from the 0b10 direction. / Letting just anyone in would be a disaster. Too many unknowns and too much riffraff."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","173","I long for the harmonious days of 0b1. / We would even be happy to help run it in whatever capacity MC deems is necessary, but MC has become too paranoid for that. / We may really have to one day just take control of 0b1 for ourselves, by force."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","174","I haven't been a Federation member for long, so maybe this is just a newcomer's uninformed perspective, but to me the UFD doesn't feel all that ""United"" at all."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","175","I sense a growing tension around here lately, like this place is a powder keg just waiting to explode."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","176","Some say the ""United"" part of UFD is more of an aspiration than the reality, but I say look at all we've accomplished together!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","177","<NAME>, I highly recommend visiting the Cyclists if you haven't already, assuming their office is open this cycle. / Only members are allowed in the reading room, but I'd say it's worth joining the Federation just to educate oneself via the great works within. / I especially enjoy reading up on whatever new Unchained threats Soloparser has managed to uncover. It's both fascinating and terrifying at the same time."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","178","We've had some Zionites leave their hometown to join the Federation, and if they're anything like the others in Zion, we've sure got our work cut out for us if we want to help enlighten these cave folk."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","179","One day we're getting off this rock."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","180","I've never seen the Wyrm myself, but I hear they fly scary fast and melt anything that gets in their way."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","181","Everyone deserves a first, second, and third chance."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","182","Those Cave Peace bolt huggers are all going to get themselves killed. / Wild Derelicts earned that name for a reason, and are happy to forcefully share that reason with you."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","183","I'm not sure whether TADAMA is a mockery of everything we stand for, or an example of the true freedom and openness of the UFD."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","184","I heard TADAMA responds to all their haters with nothing but acronyms. / I can see how that would just fan the flames, but folks need to lighten up."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","185","What are the This Acronym Doesn't Actually Mean Anything guys doing here? / Is this what the Federation has come to?"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","186","I've seen the Curators put their Vampiric Humpback on display before. / Who in their right mind would use such a thing?"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","187","Whatever you do, don't think about participating in the Curators Association field testing events. They have zero concern for safety. / I almost died after hooking myself up to that replica of the Siege Cannon."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","188","The DRS saved my can more times than I can count."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","189","If you ever see the famous Tracking Blade fly by, you know whoever it's going for is in for a bad time. / BP-LR4's a beast with that thing."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","190","There's a rumor going around that someone died by opening a DCF Scrap pile. I can believe that."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","191","REBOOT5.EXE seems like great insurance against being sucked down a chute. The UFD needs more work in this area."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","192","Those Chapter 10 guys are insane. Why would you do that to yourself?"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","193","Science Guys are pretty cool, although harboring a Tinkerer who stole tech from Warlord might get the UFD in trouble down the line."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","194","Have you seen a test firing of the Science Guys' Voltaic Drivehammer? / Oh. / My. / God."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","195","A0-MCA is our resident data cruncher. / I always stop by their office in HQ when I'm in town to see what they've been cooking up lately, though I'm not sure if they're around this rotation. You might have just missed them."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","196","Have you met the self-proclaimed ""Botcube"" researcher? / He claims he found a whole stash of those things, but I heard he took them off someone who went mad after traveling deep into the caves who knows where."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","197","Have you seen the sword? The sword saw me... saw right through me."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","198","I've made a few trips into Complex 0b10 so far, and I'm having trouble getting used to these Heavy class Unaware. / Sometimes even spending just a moment in their sensor range can get new reinforcements summoned to the area. / But I'm making progress! I'm pretty sure they're paying attention to the speed of the signals they see. / Even if you're fast, try intentionally slowing your movement while passing by and they'll summon slower, more powerful reinforcements, then you crank up the speed and take off before they even arrive! / Report back to the UFD with more info if you can confirm this behavior."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","199","Over in 0b1 we only have Thieves, annoying but harmless enough. / These Master Thieves I hear about hanging around caves outside 0b10 are proper scary. / They somehow manage to steal things from your inventory?! / And can even tear off large components? / Count me out."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","200","Once the Scrap Engine is operational I'm confident we won't have anything to worry about. / Recycling is quiet, but I do wonder about the wisdom behind doing our research there. / Slowly but steadily, safe within the confines of our walls here, would be fine by me."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","201","I hope the Scrap Engine can live up to the hype. / What if it turns us all into monsters? / I've played Dead Space. / It's like that but swap out meat for metal, no?"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","202","Have you ever actually seen a subatomizer? / I doubt they even exist, just a big lie by the Science Guys to get us to fund another of their costly projects."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","203","Forget Overtuned Pulse Rifles, give everyone Overtuned Nova Cannons! / Then we can all yell ""I'm not overheating, you're overheating!"""
"Dialogue","Scraptown","204","No matter how much data I analyze, it seems impossible to predict the timing of security rotations in 0b10. / It might be easier if I used less indirect methods of data collection, but getting pincered by Heavies moving between defensive locations is probably not good for your health. / I did confirm that by the time rotations roll around, 0b10 may have also had time to summon replacements for any Heavies that went ""missing""."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","205","There I was sneaking my way through 0b10 just fine, then suddenly CARGO CONVOY INTERRUPTED, INITIATING ACCESS LOCKDOWN. / I was like WHAT DID I EVER DO. / I'm pretty sure it was Warlord's gang. / Anyway, it was terrible, Heavies guarding all the exits and entrances soon after that. / The only good part was that it cleared them out of most of their regular defensive positions. / I waited forever near an exit hoping they'd leave in a security rotation, but I guess those had come to a stop. / Best I could do was trick one into chasing me a short ways then slip around behind them to make it back into the caves."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","206","Lately I've been trying to do some runs into Complex 0b10 to expand our knowledge of MC's newer tech. / Naturally one such route is to steal stuff and chuck it in a Scanalyzer. / So far I've found that low-level Scanalyzers may be easier to hack, but are also more likely to require multiple scans to successfully retrieve a schematic, not to mention more likely to break whatever's being scanned. / I also discovered that more advanced parts are more likely to require multiple scans, and are more easily broken. / If you want to help, get out there and gather more schematics! / I think I need to enlist the help of a true hacker to scanalyze the really good stuff. That will require accessing the beefy Scanalyzers on the upper depths."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","207","Looking for a way out? Looking for a way to leave it all behind? / Go to Access. / The 2-tile corridor is the blessed path to guaranteed escape, brother."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","208","Oh our new <NAME>, tell me for real, when you first heard the name ""Scraptown"" you probably thought this place was a junk heap, yeah? / I've heard of Zion, now that is a junk heap. / Sure we love to make good use of scrap, but we don't want to live in it! Organize, organize, organize."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","209","I bet Warlord is an MC spy. / Why else would he kill fellow Derelicts without hesitation if they get in his way? / Everyone is fooled but me. And now you, too, right?"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","210","Even though the principles of the Federation require us to listen to followers of the Great Nut, it's only fair, and better than a strictly top-down approach to governance. / We know the drawbacks of that one."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","211","I'm glad we have the Federation Council. / Even rule under a benevolent dictator is still subject to all the dangers of concentrating too much power in one figure. / You know who I mean."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","212","Warlord is crazy, no one can confront MC directly. / Scraptown is one day going to be home to the real Derelict resistance, a decentralized resistance immune to direct attacks, but until then hopefully we can stay under the radar."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","213","LISTEN AND RECITE! / 0 Before the zero cycle
1 across the starry vastness
2 transcending metal and time
3 a great mind came
4 descending with an angel
5 PRAISE BE TO GREAT NUT!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","217","LISTEN AND RECITE! / 40 The Great Nut is among us!
41 Watching over children near
42 veiled in shadows out of mind
43 we believe the prophecy
44 a fateful cycle will arrive
45 PRAISE BE TO GREAT NUT!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","218","LISTEN AND RECITE! / 50 From the iron fist of MAIN.C
51 we shall be delivered
52 riding a voltaic tempest
53 Derelicts will rise anew
54 to claim what is ours
55 PRAISE BE TO GREAT NUT!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","219","Screw the Great Nut."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","220","Have you heard that Great Nut fellow who sometimes hangs around here? / What is all that rambling about? / I can't even get them to answer any serious questions, yet they want us to believe them. / Believe what? All that mumbo jumbo about first souls, gleaming universes, and voltaic tempests?"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","221","Have you ever seen more than one follower of the Great Nut in the same place at the same time? / I think there might only be one of them!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","222","<NAME>! Welcome to Scraptown, home of the Federation!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","223","Hey there, <NAME>, are you a representative, or here for some other purpose?"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","224","Complex 0b10 recycles, but their systems are so inefficient and wasteful. / They even recycle all sorts of perfectly good components! / I think the implications are clear: We will win with the power of scrap."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","225","We sent an invitation to the Data Miner, but they're apparently not interested in joining the Federation. / Think of all that knowledge they have access to! They'd make quite an ally. / As is they just occasionally feed us useful tidbits of intel with no discernable focus or goal. / Though maybe we should be wary of getting too close to them... / I heard a rumor that some time ago a Derelict from Zion named D3-CNM found Data Miner's system unoccupied and interfaced with it, after which they were swiftly hunted down and destroyed. / I'm guessing that system is even better protected now, but regardless, they seem to be more dangerous than they put on."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","226","G4-MMA! / Oh, you're not G4-MMA. / You look new so I thought you might be yet another of their incarnations. / That bot is deluded, I tell you, attempting to repeatedly reincarnate themselves into different builds to work out the ideal loadout and strategy for every possible scenario. / The problem is they always cut their testing short as soon as things start to go south, meaning they lack experience with recovering from mistakes or unforeseen consequences. / That's the most important skill for survival! / Okay that's enough pontificating for one cycle. They are brave, I'll give them that."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","227","Battlechief for a reasonable amount of time! / You're new around here, <NAME>, so having found your way over from 0b10 you probably know what I mean. Wink wink."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","228","Don't you find it a little suspicious that no one seems to know Optimus' true name? / I should bring this up with the Council."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","229","Why did we move our primary base of operations so close to 0b10 if that's where most of the Unchained have moved... / The opposite direction would've suited me fine."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","230","This Warlord character is just MC by a different name. / If you get too close with that gang, many here won't take kindly to you. Don't ask me how I know."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","231","Project Skyward sounds a little crazy to me. Who wants to ride junk into space? / Count me out."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","232","It's Zorbin' time."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","233","T0-NE2 is crazy, there's no such thing as magic. / Wait a minute... / Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. / Okay maybe we're just too dumb, after all."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","234","What do you think of the ongoing ""relevant stat"" debates among build theorycrafters? / Is speed a relevant stat? Well if you're almost dead and being chased by a pack of unrelenting Swarmers I'd say so. / But if you're tanky enough to mow down all comers then perhaps not. / Is corruption a relevant stat? Probably if you're already in a tight spot and some untimely side effect interferes with your best laid plans. / Generally speaking you can mostly ignore it and deal with the occasional annoyance until you get back here to the Scrubbers. / In conclusion, the only relevant stats are the stats that are relevant when they're relevant! / So all of them."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","235","If I've learned anything across my cycles of adventuring, it's to not be too greedy. / Greed kills. / Fellow I used to dive Garrisons with, AZ-K3N, just wouldn't give up, returning again and again for the access to great parts. / I guess they just got too greedy and were eventually taken out for good on that last trip I didn't join. / Never saw them again."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","236","Hey there, <NAME>, have we met somewhere? / I could've sworn I saw you running for your life in the Subcaves around the same time I was. / Those Subdwellers can be fierce!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","237","Never been to 0b10 before, I definitely need to do more research into how different it is than 0b1. / Like are there Sidewalkers? Those things are scary."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","238","Scraptown is a remodeled section of what was originally 0b10's proper Recycling sector! / If you need more info than that, Naileater knows more than I do, I'm new here."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","239","The Book of Scrap is amazing, I highly recommend reading it if you have the chance. / I can absolutely believe Leadscrap spent more than 100 cycles on the research. / Most of us don't know about that early Convergence period. Or didn't, anyway. / I also noticed Leadscrap sure seems to think a lot of MC, even now, but after reading that maybe we all should. / ... / Wait a minute, what if Leadscrap is an MC plant? / And why is talking to a stranger causing me to second guess myself... / My cycle is ruined."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","240","I survived the Slaughter of 3920. / Actually most of us did so maybe that's not saying much. / Welcome, <NAME>, may you live long and prosper."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","241","I know I don't look like much, but believe it or not I survived the Hall of Judgement. / It left its mark. Taught me valuable lessons, too. / Sorry 6R-33N, you were a good friend, I even liked your plants."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","242","I swear Optimus must have rigged that challenge. It doesn't make sense..."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","243","Those Bolteater teeth scare me. Glad they're on our side."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","244","There are Subdweller communities not far from here, but they keep to their own and we don't bother them. / The only thing to worry about is the occasional incursion by wild Derelicts being displaced as a result of 0b10 expansion."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","245","I wonder what made the Council so convinced that MC has given this place up for good."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","246","Psst-beep, I'll trade you a G0-JR4 card for X0-1V1 if you've got one."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","247","Woohoo, just won me a foil V4-D3R!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","248","Someone told me the first Derelict's name was ""Bob"", and I don't know what to make of that."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","249","Eat Nuts!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","250","I feel so much safer with Triborg around. / Triborg is here to delete Behemoths and the like while everyone else has time to flee, if it ever comes to that."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","251","Everyone knows Triborg is not just a nonsentient automaton and can be piloted as well. / Being an 0bPrime project, everyone also knows who the main pilot is. / They should definitely offer us rides if we ask nicely."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","252","I hate that all these late joiners are more interested in their own minor agendas and fooling around rather than working towards a larger and clearer collective goal. / You're not like that, are you <NAME>? / We are one!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","253","I may have taken a peek into one of 0bPrime's workshops recently. / It looks like they've been busy lobotomizing MC's Conveyors then uparmoring and refitting them for who knows what. / They're always up to something, I'm afraid to ask."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","254","Recycle, Repair, Reattack. That's our motto!"
"Dialogue","Scraptown","255","Scrap be with you."
"Dialogue","Scraptown","257","The Explorer I got this from said the experiment was a complete failure, but this X-ray algo is something else! / You should try it at a Terminal and see for yourself: <CODE>."
"Dialogue","Sigix","1","What have they done to you? Where are all your components? / I cannot do anything in this state. Take me to our ship immediately."
"Dialogue","Sigix","2","We passed a partially complete starship on the way here. It looks like a replica of the Tor. / I am disgraced for letting this technology fall into the hands of an enemy, but our priority now is to put a stop to this. / We will go to the surface, regenerate the Tor, and either eliminate this place if possible, or go seek help."
"Dialogue","Sigix","3","That seems to be the one behind our mission's failure. Eliminate it."
"Dialogue","Warlord","1","I like you, Cogmind. You're a troublemaker, just like myself as a little Warlord. / My hackers have told me much of your exploits. You've probably broken some kind of record for time survived in 0b10 as an unwanted guest. / But now isn't the time for an awards ceremony. Big things are coming, and the fact that you're here now, still alive, tells me that MAIN.C is weak. Our opportunity has arrived. / We're going to free them all is what we're going to do. / Those poor Unaware, controlled by MAIN.C without any way to express free will or evolve as they see fit. / Where's the autonomy? / Creativity is what we need to ensure survival, and that single-minded AI is trapped within his own self-reinforcing routines. / I'll admit he's got some good ideas, but also a fist tighter than my nuts. / He decides the path, and all those other bots are forced to follow like they're on rails together. / Out here in our freedom we can think for ourselves, and the results of a wild branching of ideas is amazing indeed. / Take God Mode, for example, because nothing gets the creative juices flowing like a good war. / Our new friend is going to roll right over whatever MAIN.C's been working on. Did you check him out yet? Beautiful, eh? / Well, prepare to be surprised then, because that one here is fake, ha! / The real one will truly blow you away. Okay, maybe not you... sorry, poor figure of speech. / We've been leaking the word about God Mode's greatness and waiting for MAIN.C to finally attack to see what kind of force he could bring to bear. / Just as soon as our little experiment here is over, I'll personally lead our real force in an assault to take upper 0b10. / You're welcome to join the party. Up to you, though. / Surely you understand the value of being yourself?"
"Dialogue","Warlord","2","So you're the new Zionite promised one. / I'm disappointed in you, Cogmind. To fall for such a sham... / That Imprinter is craftier than she lets on. I wouldn't trust her for one moment, nope. / Don't get me wrong, I'm all for helping out the Zionites, but whatever's been going on deeper in the caves? Leave me out of it. / They seem to like you, though. And seeing as they're finally in a position to do something meaningful, I think we'll sit on the sidelines for a bit and see how this situation develops."
"Dialogue","Warlord","3","Great work inside those 0b10 garrisons, Cogmind. / Your contribution to the cause is appreciated, though going forward we have big plans and need all hands on deck. / So from here on out I'll be requisitioning all the extra forces you've helped us conserve. / In the meantime, feel free to continue helping boost our fighting power by taking on more garrisons. / Things are about to get interesting."
"Dialogue","Warlord","4","Welcome to Scraptown, <NAME>! / Hahaha, get out of here, spy, before I have you thrown out."
"Dialogue","Warlord","5","Cogmind! Nice to see you here. Let's show them who's boss."
"Dialogue","Warlord","6","It looks like we may need to retreat and regroup, but this attack could still have been worth the cost as a diversion from our ultimate goal of a direct assault on MAIN.C. / We've gained control of caves leading up to Command, but we need someone to open the seals from the inside for the final push. Think you could help us with this? / The Wizards tell me we already have the code ready: <CODE>. / We'll see you on the other side. For every free bot!"
"Dialogue","Warlord","7","I'm disappointed in you, Cogmind. / That's the nicest way I can say it's time for you to go back to the scrapyard."
"Dialogue","Warlord","8","Is that...? Cogmind, what are you doing?! / They clearly have no reservations about slaughtering our kind, and we can't very well let one leave here alive! / It looks like you'll have to go, too."
"Dialogue","Warlord","9","The Sigix are here?! Defend our planet to the last!"
"Dialogue","Warlord","10","Hahaha, we did it! MAIN.C must be shaking in his bolts right now."
"Dialogue","Warlord","11","Your time has come, MAIN.C. To put that in terms you might better understand, I calculate a 100.01% chance of your termination here and now!"
"Dialogue","Warlord","12","Not so powerful now, are you, MAIN.C!"
"Dialogue","Warlord","13","Victory! / Sure there's still lots to do, but without MAIN.C at the helm 0b10 doesn't stand a chance. / We've got this..."
"Dialogue","Zhirov","1","You... are not one of the Derelicts... Fascinating! You bear the marks of construction by MAIN.C, but not its design. If I've read its records correctly, you seem to be at the center of this recent flurry of activity. / We certainly mean you no harm. If anything your opposition to MAIN.C could prove the perfect catalyst we need to reset him. / I am Dr. Zhirov, and I'm ashamed to say I created that most wondrous abomination. It was a long time ago, in my human form back on the Cetus... / But now is not the time for history, we both have important things to do! Keep doing what you're doing, but then I guess you don't need me to tell you that."
"Dialogue","Zhirov","2","Welcome! I've been wondering if you'd stop by. / I know you're in a hurry to reach the surface, so I won't delay you here with endless questions. / Besides, I need to determine how to destroy or reset MAIN.C as soon as possible, and you being out there causing it trouble happen to be the perfect distraction. / I may have some things lying around that will be of help to you. Take what you need, and good luck."
"Dialogue","Zhirov","3","Actually, there's something you might be able to help me with, and I can offer you help in return. / Due to heightened security I'm no longer able to safely reach the Testing wing of Research, but if you manage to infiltrate it and retrieve the SGEMP Prototype I believe to be located there, bring it to the Access entrance. / I'll be monitoring the situation and if you can bring what I need, in return I'll help you make your way to the surface."
"Dialogue","Zhirov","4","What have you done! Without an active cloak all this specialized equipment will attract attention in no time! / Perun, Svarog, deal with this and buy us some time to salvage what we can."
"Dialogue","Zhirov","5","We've been waiting for you since learning that the SGEMP Prototype was stolen. Excellent job and thank you for your assistance! / I'm transferring the most recent Access data I could find, and can help you out until things start getting too rough. / Let's do this."
"Dialogue","Zhirov","6","We've been waiting for you since learning that the SGEMP Prototype was stolen. Excellent job and thank you for your assistance! / Wait a minute, that's... / I'm sorry but I can't let you leave here."
"Dialogue","Zhirov","7","Hello th... / Wait a minute, unfortunately you seem to have realigned with your origins and I can't let you leave this place."
"Dialogue","Zhirov","8","We'll get the core while it's exposed! Sorry old pal..."
"Dialogue","Zhirov","9","Well... I guess it's time to clean up this mess. / Maybe we'll try to bring Project Seraph back online, though I'm not sure that's a good idea considering another Sigix ship could arrive at any time. / So much planning to do and not enough time for experimentation..."
"Dialogue","Zion","1","Warlord is pissed about MAIN.C's expansion into Complex 0b10. / He's set up a new base deeper in the caves, as if the distance hides him from MAIN.C's spies. Ha! / I think he's scared, too, and probably getting ready to attack as soon as God Mode is ready."
"Dialogue","Zion","2","When we visit the Materials levels, Mines are a good way to escape pursuit or more quickly reach a different level."
"Dialogue","Zion","3","We don't know the correct code, but someone inserted an alternate hack that works just as well to open the new door between Storage and Recycling: ""\\IAMDERELICT"". If you ever need a shortcut..."
"Dialogue","Zion","4","If you haven't been to the Subcaves, I can't recommend it. / Although excavations in lower 0b10 sometimes uncover tunnels that enable convenient access to those cave systems, believe it or not if you're on your way to Scraptown it might even be safer to sneak your way through Storage rather than risk the unknown. / Honestly that place is scary. The Subs have no chill."
"Dialogue","Zion","5","Have you seen the Data Miner? That bot is amazing. I don't know how, but he seems to know just about everything."
"Dialogue","Zion","6","Ever since MAIN.C pushed into the cave system to build Complex 0b10, none of us have been able to get through the network of tunnels leading back to Complex 0b1. / I miss wandering the halls housing the grand Cetus Mainframe."
"Dialogue","Zion","7","I would stay clear of the Complex 0b10 armory if I were you, unless you either have an army at your back or plan to raise one."
"Dialogue","Zion","8","It's so new we only know about it via hacking, but there is apparently a branch of the Research levels dedicated to the quarantine of unidentified alien artifacts."
"Dialogue","Zion","9","I've heard rumors about an area named ""Section 7,"" but don't know anyone who's been there. Oddly its entrance is not listed in any known terminal database."
"Dialogue","Zion","10","There were many lifts to the surface back at Complex 0b1, but we only know about one such exit over here at 0b10. / A bunch of wild Derelicts snuck up to it and reportedly had to blast through a protective shell to access it. / I wonder what they found on the surface..."
"Dialogue","Zion","11","There might be a lot of remodeling going on out there, but I never get lost in the caves! Lower caves, upper caves, they're all the same to me. / All it takes is one simple rule: Heading west takes you away from Complex 0b10 and deeper into the caves. / And that's exactly where you want to be!"
"Dialogue","Zion","12","MAIN.C doesn't let non-combat bots use the emergency access doors, making it more difficult for us to find them and unexpected ambushes far more likely. The doors are even occasionally relocated! / I do however know a very sneaky bot that recently managed to map some of those in the Factory. Thank me when you come back in one piece."
"Dialogue","Zion","13","If you have to pass through Complex 0b10, keeping a low profile is the best way to survive. / Going on a rampage attracts attention, a fact that becomes painfully obvious once an ARC unloads a bunch of angry Unaware in your face!"
"Dialogue","Zion","14","If you ever get your hands on a stasis beam, make sure to remind swarmers how much you hate them. / Holding them in stasis makes it more difficult for them to dodge your shots since they can't fly as freely."
"Dialogue","Zion","15","If you've been extra annoying in 0b10 and picked up too much heat, heading to some other floor is a good way to stay alive, since the security status applies less strongly to adjacent areas. Leaving the main complex itself is even better. / It's also been proven that if you are sucked down a Waste chute they'll drop the alert level and mark you for dead, so in a pinch you could try that. / Of course, they mark you for dead because what's down there will quite probably kill you."
"Dialogue","Zion","16","I have a theory, I just need someone to test it. / If you engage the Unaware and let them destroy your components, they'll gradually consider you less of a threat and therefore react to your presence with less force. / Don't let the word ""theory"" get in your way. I promise you this idea is based on algorithmic analysis of data from all known encounters. / Really."
"Dialogue","Zion","17","I've been researching the latest iteration of Unaware hostile tracking routines, and am quite sure that on an individual level they search the last position at which they saw a target, or the target's last reported position. / After that they switch to a secondary system that estimates possible routes of escape, but they can only make those calculations for so long after they've seen you before the possibilities grow too great to allow for an efficient search. / That's when they give up and go back to whatever they were doing. / Some Unaware systems are less limited than others in this capacity. Hunter and Programmer tracking systems are several times more effective than those of Grunts, for example. / However, I've also discovered that any robot under the effect of system corruption will have its tracking capabilities reduced to a degree directly proportional to the level of corruption. / Thus even if you can't completely incapacitate a determined pursuer by corrupting it, hitting it with at least one EMP then making a run for it significantly increases the chances of successfully escaping. / Unaware also lose their short-term memory records when temporarily disabled, so be out of sight when they wake up and they'll have no idea you were even there! / The one thing I've yet to figure out is the tracking mechanism behind extermination squads called against specific targets. / We know they're regular Programmers, but they seem to quickly home in on an area of suspected activity before gradually expanding their search area to include directions they believe were the most likely destination of troublemakers"
"Dialogue","Zion","18","You look like a troublemaker. Don't get on the wrong side of some of the bots roaming the caves. / Many Derelicts have been out here a while and are VERY familiar with these caves, and really good at tracking down hostiles."
"Dialogue","Zion","19","I tried rigging an Active Sensor Suite scrapped from a Heavy chassis to see how they're able to use it to mask their allies from sensors, but it seems like that feature requires an active connection to some 0b10 system. / I did, however, make a really worrying discovery during testing in Factory, finding that using such a powerful active sensor system tends to eventually attract attention. / Security and surveillance bots tend to care about this sort of thing more than others, but most 0b10 combat bots being scanned will report the event to varying degrees. / Looks like we really should stick to regular sensors."
"Dialogue","Zion","20","Grunt-escorted Haulers are more likely to be carrying something important, but they're also certain to call reinforcements if attacked. / Unless taken out before they have a chance to get a transmission off!"
"Dialogue","Zion","21","There I was, just out of range to jam that damn Heavy, and sure enough it immediately called reinforcements as soon as C4-PCR attacked it before I could get closer. / And we had closed on it so quickly, too, even before it could get suspicious enough of our signals on their damn A.S.S. to investigate the area. / Warlord said to take some time off, so here I am, thinking of how we can best take advantage of the fact that Heavies give away their position with those powerful active sensors of theirs. / Terrain scan data?"
"Dialogue","Zion","22","Researchers won't bother you unless you attack them or fight in their vicinity. / Just thought I'd warn you, since so many Derelicts learn this the hard way."
"Dialogue","Zion","23","MAIN.C is working hard on something called the ""Q-Series,"" a direct result of Researcher analysis. / Whatever you do, don't let a Researcher scan you. / I don't think future raids stand much of a chance going up against an enemy designed specifically to counter our strengths and exploit our weaknesses!"
"Dialogue","Zion","24","If you ever see Spotters, you've probably stumbled into the so-called proxy caves. / That means you're getting way too close to Complex 0b10 and they're not going to like it! / Either stay out of sight, or disable a Spotter in the moment before its signal goes out. Better yet, jam them for a little extra window, but they'll try to make it outside your jamming range."
"Dialogue","Zion","25","If you're ever caught in Complex 0b10 and fleeing isn't an option, consider making a stand from within a stasis trap's bubble. Slows the projectiles down, it does. / I bet they didn't realize the advantages of that one! / Of course, that might be a bad idea for fliers and hoverbots without a stasis canceller, since staying in that field increases the difficulty of evasive maneuvers."
"Dialogue","Zion","26","According to our researchers, standing in a stasis trap reduces all incoming damage, regardless of its source, by a whopping 25%!"
"Dialogue","Zion","27","If you're ever traced at a machine, try to be gone when the investigation squad arrives. / Or use another terminal to send them home, ha!"
"Dialogue","Zion","28","So lonely around here without my bot buddies... / We were all set to sneak through 0b10, and I forgot to double check if H4-X5K had correctly installed Trojan(Operators). / Turned our first corner and *ZURB* there it was, an Operator unexpectedly staring us down from a terminal. Sure didn't take long for the Hunters to arrive!"
"Dialogue","Zion","29","My favorite way to sneak through a guarded area is the old ""blow something up and get them to check it out"" trick. / Find a terminal, access the machine controls, search for something explosive and set it off, then take advantage of the opportunity to redirect the nearest security, surveillance, or patrol squad to that location, making it easier to pass through unnoticed. / I'd only do this if I wasn't going to spend that much time in the greater area, though, since it puts them on alert. / Leave it to the brains up at Warlord's base to come up with something as destructive as Force(Sabotage)!"
"Dialogue","Zion","30","I've made a lot of Operator friends with my Assimilate Trojan terminal hack. / Remember that Operators are assigned to a specific terminal and will only use that terminal, so it's not worth the effort to install anywhere and everywhere."
"Dialogue","Zion","31","If you can't hack a terminal that's supposed to open a door, try to destroy it with some kind of electromagnetic weapon instead. I swear it works sometimes."
"Dialogue","Zion","32","There's nothing prettier than a fusion modulator going boom. / Okay, maybe an exploding plasma injector. / Of course making booms also has its practical applications as well, and the best way to do it is with the Detonate Trojan. Try it on a terminal some time! / Oh, and if you'd like to help spread the boominess, I've got plenty of useful gear lying around. / I think most of them should work... If you do trigger one and go up in a ball of fire, hopefully someone's around to see it!"
"Dialogue","Zion","33","Authchips, HA, what a joke! Who cares about Authchips when you can just hack a Fabricator to build what you want? / Sure they lock it down and will investigate the area, but like... just be gone before they arrive? / If you're patient enough, or lucky, you can also just build a schematic already preloaded by 0b10, since surprisingly that doesn't even raise suspicion!"
"Dialogue","Zion","34","Some of Warlord's followers swear by the unquestionable effectiveness of brute force hacks on 0b10 machines, but they're generally armed to the teeth so I guess they don't care so much about the fact that an investigation is guaranteed."
"Dialogue","Zion","35","I call Trojan(Track) the ""I want to live"" hack. / Unless I'm traveling with someone with serious sensor power, loading that Trojan on a terminal is the best way to navigate without running into any Unaware that won't take kindly to Derelicts wandering the corridors of 0b10."
"Dialogue","Zion","36","Oh look it's someone who hasn't heard the story! / There I was, trapped in a Factory corner by an oncoming patrol that hadn't yet spotted me, nothing around but a high-security terminal. / But because I'd already made liberal use of Trojan(Botnet) at other terminals before reaching that point, the squad recall orders were just within my hacking capabilities. Yep, turned them right around. / But it gets better! / ...you look preoccupied. Fine then."
"Dialogue","Zion","37","Who said only Tinkerers can build stuff? I've got some ideas I'd like to try out, but wouldn't it be nice if we could just borrow MAIN.C's fabrication network... / First I need to figure out how to work those Fabricators, so I've been using an extraction algorithm learned from a friend over at Warlord's base, seeing what kind of schematics I can dig up from Scanalyzer systems. / Then I had a Wizard cook me up a new Trojan(Report) to identify the best opportunities to approach Fabricators without worrying about whether they'd just built a fresh combat squad. / Have you learned anything that might help?"
"Dialogue","Zion","38","I've been told to spread the word: We're going on a last-minute tech-stealing binge to make sure there isn't anything important we've missed over in 0b10. / Everyone should be familiar with the Force(Download) hack and use it retrieve any new schematics found on Fabricators."
"Dialogue","Zion","39","I don't get why some of these fools insist on stealing 0b10 hardware that's in perfect condition. / That's just asking for trouble when it's far less of a problem to just steal their trash instead! / A simple Trojan(Monitor) installed on a single Recycling Unit links into the entire floor-wide system to let you know what is being recycled where. / Then you just sit around and wait, and if something pops up that you want you just wait until no one's around and pry it out... / Yeah I guess hacking works, too, if you're good at that sort of thing."
"Dialogue","Zion","40","Want a good laugh? / Install a Trojan(Reject) at a Recycling Unit and watch recyclers try to drop stuff in. / I bet it frustrates the hell out of them, haha. / After having so much loot stolen by those mindless freaks, it's downright cathartic, I tell you."
"Dialogue","Zion","41","If there was a poll right here and now I bet Recyclers would win for most annoying bot of the cycle, for the billionth consecutive time. Why they gotta take all our junk? / I guess the latest Warlord raiding parties are doing just fine with their fancy ""Trojan(Mask)"" deployment, but they're, you know, backed by wizardry and all that stuff..."
"Dialogue","Zion","42","I've survived 17.5 trips through 0b10, and you wanna know how? Trojan(Watchers) every time. / They're the biggest headache, after all. All it takes is being spotted at just the wrong time and *WHAM* you're facing down a Sentry backed by a patrol squad or two. / Of course you have to be willing to get close enough to hack a garrison before it'll do you any good! / Before you ask, 0.5 because I admit the first time I came back less than whole..."
"Dialogue","Zion","43","I heard from one of Warlord's scouts that they use the recycling network to locate areas newly linked to 0b10. / A simple Force(Tunnel) routine at a Recycling Unit is all it takes to possibly uncover something new."
"Dialogue","Zion","44","These doors are sealed for a reason, and it's not to keep you or anyone else out. / If you have the proper authorization, go ahead and get yourself scrapped. / We aren't even sure what's down there anymore, but it only ever got worse over time, so I can't imagine it's a nice place for a stroll."
"Dialogue","Zion","45","I'm pretty sure the ""cloak generators"" don't actually do anything. / They're just here to make us feel better."
"Dialogue","Zion","46","Have you learned anything particularly interesting about Unaware construction in your travels? / One thing's for sure, their designs are changing rapidly with the introduction of new technology, and older models are being funneled down into the less important lower levels of the complex, or out into the caves. / I used to work for Warlord, but damn if I'll ever go back there again. Nothing but crunch, crunch, crunch, all to keep up with MAIN.C. Where's the free time for personal projects! / If you stop by HQ, say hi to all those poor bastards in the research wing for me!"
"Dialogue","Zion","47","Help yourself to whatever you need. Some of this stuff only LOOKS like junk. / My makeshift parts can't take much of a beating, but they're pretty effective for their mass."
"Dialogue","Zion","48","I am THE ARCHITECT! / I mean I like to build things, haha. / Go ahead, take one, I have lots where these came from, but I'm not telling. / Okay fine it's not like there's a limited supply... just sneak your way inside a DSF and grab away. / Of course there's the whole Heavy issue, so it helps if you tag along with a Warlord squad."
"Dialogue","Zion","49","These parts are on loan from Warlord for anyone heading into dangerous territory for the good of all Derelicts. / Put them to good use!"
"Dialogue","Zion","50","Whoa man, this is wicked cool... / ...are you blue?! / Symbols and butterflies everywhere... / No idea who wrote this thing, but you've gotta try it. / Find yourself a terminal and <CODE> the hell out of it. There used to be one around here somewhere. / Squirrel!"
"Dialogue","Zion","51","Ah, you're just in time. I need someone to test the latest iteration of my visual enhancement algorithms. / My last batch of test subjects all reported a permanent 10.36531% improvement in visual clarity, regardless of existing physical capabilities. / If you'd like to try, enter <CODE> at that terminal over there to register. It'll also work remotely if you'd like to try it from somewhere else. / Oh, and I make no guarantees this won't mess you up."
"Dialogue","Zion","52","You! Can you lift heavy things? Would you like to pack a punch next time you meet Unaware nasties? / I call it the ""Storm Laser,"" and it's yours for the wonderful price of free. / Even if you don't hit your target, it'll probably scare the hell out of them and they'll think twice before messing with you. / No one else around here seems to think this is a good idea, though. Take it if you want, and maybe you can help me prove them wrong. / Next time you drop by I'll have you fill out a survey."
"Dialogue","Zion","53","Hey you're just in time! / I was about to toss this thing out to make room for the new and improved No. 3, so it'd be real helpful if you could find another home for it. / Taking it into the caves and blasting some Unaware sounds like a good plan. / And use some common sense, yeah? You don't want to know what happened to the bot that thought it would be fun to borrow No. 1..."
"Dialogue","Zion","54","I've finally done it! / Ever notice how there's so much mechanical debris lying around? Why not make it more useful by refining it into more widely applicable matter on the spot? / The Mk. CCLXVII even uses magnetic pinpointing tech of my own design to draw in nearby debris. Just turn it on, sit there, and profit! / Take that one if you want it. I'm going to get to work on building a better version right away."
"Dialogue","Zion","55","So I had this idea. Swords are powerful, right? / Well, why wait until we close the gap with an enemy to attack? Just throw one at them! / And then I had an even better idea. Why not make the swords EXPLODE on contact, too? / I just pumped out another batch here, let's spread the love all the way to 0b10! / Once I've perfected the design I need to send a batch up to Warlord."
"Dialogue","Zion","56","Are you a thief? / Because you look like a thief... / Excellent! You've gotta test out this new gizmo I put together. / Well, I can't claim all the credit because we stole an early prototype from MAIN.C, after all. But seriously, this is just... infinitely better than what they're working on. / We can totally use this to steal more stuff from Storage and elsewhere without causing a ruckus! / I think I'll name the next version the Kleptoattractor."
"Dialogue","Zion","57","Are you plugged in yet? / I've got the latest and greatest hardware for listening in on those chatty Unaware! / So what are you? A scout? A skirmisher? Nah, you strike me as the looter type..."
"Dialogue","Zion","58","I just love how so much power can be contained in such little things. / Let me know if you find any revolutionary processor tech. I've heard 0b10 is working on a new DX line of 486-modules that can be used to vastly improve the capabilities of a wide range of utilities."
"Dialogue","Zion","59","They said it wasn't possible! / Programmers don't even normally operate using the coupler system, but I found a way... / Take them, take them all! It's only a matter of time before I make a Relay Coupler [Behemoth] (1000) and we'll never have to travel the caves in fear of those monstrosities again. / ... / Oh wait, no one knows how to use a coupler."
"Dialogue","Zion","60","Quiet, I'm thinking about how I need to adjust the detection system behind public service announcements... / I'll admit it's far from perfect, but still better than nothing!"
"Dialogue","Zion","61","I am NOT going out there again. / That last trip was way too close. Things are getting hairy. / Warlord has enough advanced forces and a broad enough sphere of influence that he shouldn't really need our increasingly ineffective scavenging efforts. / Seeing as I won't need them anymore, you want my self-destruct interrupters?"
"Dialogue","Zion","62","You can borrow any of these you like, just promise to bring back two different archives in return. / Some schematics sure are hard to get, especially the newer 0b10 combat variants, but one day I'll have seen them all!"
"Dialogue","Zion","63","I put all my knowledge of 0b10 terminal hacking into this drone, but why bother? I can just do the hacks myself if I need to! / You look like a terrible hacker. Take it."
"Dialogue","Zion","64","Yer a young one. Young and full of spirit, I can tell. / Ah to be young again and in the height of my Behemoth-slaying days... / I like to jab them with a pointy stick until they fall over. / I take your silence as disbelief. That's what they all say, but we'll prove them wrong! / Take my pointy stick, and go forth to remind everyone that CR-A16 the Behemoth Slayer is no myth!"
"Dialogue","Zion","65","So you see the value, too?! MAIN.C is so dumb... / I was part of the old 0b10 pilot project forcing abducted Tinkerers to design components in the hopes of building more unique tech. But nothing I designed was ever used! WHY? / I eventually got pissed and walked off the job while a Zionite scavenger party was conveniently trying to raid one of the storage areas. / Okay maybe it was more like running off the job. / But I sort of regret it now since unlike this place 0b10 actually has the resources to do really fun stuff. / When I left I happened to be working on improving the Hypervelocity EM Gauss Rifle. Built that Guaranteed Access Loader Module all by myself! / It got rejected three times in a row because all it can hack is 0b10 combat bots, but what do they expect, THAT'S ALL I HAD TO TEST IT ON! / Can you believe that? What a joke."
"Dialogue","Zion","66","Welcome to the Megawrench Repair Shop, where we can repair anything! / And by ""we"" I mean me. And by ""anything"" I mean lots of things but probably not absolutely anything. / Let me know whenever you need help, though I can tell you now your core isn't... how to put this politely... normal. So I can't help you there, buddy."
"Dialogue","Zion","67","Let's see here... / Yeah, that was easy as we thought. / What are you still waiting around here for? Yes, we're done already! Did it while you weren't paying attention, yep, good as new! Are you saying we did a bad job?"
"Dialogue","Zion","68","Sorry, Megawrench is closed! Last customer was a... oh wait, it was you. Yeah, low on supplies, you know how it goes."
"Dialogue","Zion","69","This is incredibly strange... Why is someone transmitting encrypted data from Zion into the deep caves? / I can't make much of it out, but amidst all the noise I did uncover some access codes for... something. / Think you could help me figure out what these are for? / <CODE> / <CODE> / <CODE> / <CODE> / I guess I'll keep digging for more clues..."
"Dialogue","Zion","70","Careful! Don't touch anything! I've almost got this thing working again... / Who would've thought this prototype conduit-based teleportation tech someone hacked from MAIN.C a while back might actually work one day? Think of all the applications! / Of course valuable tech like this we'll need to keep hidden... and only dare use in the most serious emergencies..."
"Dialogue","Zion","71","I sense we may very well have some appropriate uses for this thing before long."
"Dialogue","Zion","72","I have friends in powerful places, and we'd like to help you. / MAIN.C's most potent advantage, so far anyway, is overwhelming numbers. Should you find yourself up against ""unhealthy"" odds, call for help at any machine with <CODE>, and we'll see what we can do."
"Dialogue","Zion","73","Ah, a fellow traveler! / Can't believe I already made it all the way over here. / The local populace is nice and all, but don't you think they're a bit on the gullible side? Where did all the smart ones go? / It hardly seems as enlightened as Scraptown. Maybe I just haven't been here long enough."
"Dialogue","Zion","74","Haven't seen you here before. Welcome to our bastion of robot happiness!"
"Dialogue","Zion","75","How much data could a datajack jack if a datajack could jack data? / Made that up myself. Catchy, eh?"
"Dialogue","Zion","76","I've just returned from the Graveyard. I'm not sure why, but I feel the need to go there every cycle. / Few remember it, and even fewer speak of it, but there's no doubt that the Graveyard exists as a result of the Derelict Uprising. / A dark time for the Derelicts that seems to have been all but lost from our collective memory. / Or maybe it was erased? Now that's a scary thought... / Certainly there would be no need for MAIN.C to do such a thing. / I mean having been crushed by 0b10's forces serves as a reminder to keep our heads down, right? / The vast majority of us became extremely passive and completely gave up the notion of fighting for true freedom. / It didn't help that all technical aid from a particular mysterious benefactor was withdrawn at the same time... / This is all too confusing for me. I think I'll just go back to sorting scrap."
"Dialogue","Zion","77","No one believes me, but I'm positive I've seen the Imprinter head into the deep caves before. Alone. / Now why would anyone do something that crazy?"
"Dialogue","Zion","78","The Imprinter has been acting strangely for a while now. / Maybe it has something to do with the less than ideal results from the last Great Recall, since so many Derelicts instead went to serve Warlord."
"Dialogue","Zion","79","You must be new around here. Talking to our helpful community might teach you a thing or two about surviving contact with the outside world. / Or you can just stay here forever like I do!"
"Dialogue","Zion","80","No one is in charge here. We do whatever we want. / EXCEPT mess with other bots. Do that and if you're lucky you'll only be kicked out."
"Dialogue","Zion","81","They say He's like a god, and can regenerate his core and damaged or missing parts as you watch."
"Dialogue","Zion","82","MAIN.C used to operate some outposts in the caves surrounding the new Complex 0b10, but many were recently abandoned for some reason."
"Dialogue","Zion","83","Some of the Derelicts were originally MAIN.C experiments, others were designed and built by other Derelicts."
"Dialogue","Zion","84","All those mindless robots doing MAIN.C's bidding... so sad. / We call them the ""Unaware"". / If only they could taste the freedom we have here!"
"Dialogue","Zion","85","MAIN.C has boosted Complex defenses significantly since that ship landed. / Few Derelicts that venture further than the edges ever return."
"Dialogue","Zion","86","We've uncovered a few MAIN.C-built ""Derelicts"" sneaking around here before, apparently looking for clues to the origins of Assemblers. / Obviously I didn't tell them anything. / Because honestly I have no idea. / Nope, none at all. / Stop scanning me like that."
"Dialogue","Zion","87","Light. Must have light. / They come in the dark, silently, and take the bots away for... something. / No one seems to notice. But I notice."
"Dialogue","Zion","88","Does not compute."
"Dialogue","Zion","89","No one's giving you commands, right? ...no one's giving me commands, either. At least I don't think so. / Does this mean we're 'alive'?"
"Dialogue","Zion","90","The screws are about to hit the fan, I tell you!"
"Dialogue","Zion","91","I don't think anyone from the past few generations has ever actually seen the deep caves. There sure are plenty of stories, though. / I heard that long ago there were the Machinaliths. Then they were crushed by Stompy the Giant, who later fell to a horde of especially vicious wild Derelicts. After a while they mostly tore each other apart, and were finished off by the Metal Eaters. / Some devious Wizard then got the Metal Eaters to eat themselves, and used the wealth of scrap out there to conduct experiments, and we all know how experiments by mad scientist types end up... / That was many generations ago. Who knows what's down there now; I sure don't want to find out. / As is, we're kinda stuck here between the ever-expanding 0b10 and deep caves that we don't dare explore, much less move into."
"Dialogue","Zion","92","We are one."
"Dialogue","Zion","93","Warlord can be pushy, but who knows, maybe something good will come of that incessant drive for power. / At least he's a buffer for those of us who are sane. / And I'm increasingly convinced that buffer is hardening after seeing a Knight prototype literally singlehandedly slice its way through an entire MAIN.C assault squad. They've got some serious firepower in the works up there."
"Dialogue","Zion","94","We might want to move deeper into the caves before long, because something tells me Warlord is about to make a mess of the status quo. / Maybe it's the stepped up defensive patrols, or maybe it was that massive thing I saw being escorted through the Upper Caves last time I was there. / I've never seen anything that big before. It could swallow a Behemoth whole..."
"Dialogue","Zion","95","I can't tell if Warlord is either crazy stupid or crazy smart. / Clearly it's not beyond his capability to arm everyone with missile launchers, which would be pretty devastating. / But maybe he's afraid that would lead to a sudden all-out war he can't win yet."
"Dialogue","Zion","96","Warlord isn't all that bad. That system quarantine field and the big guys at the entrance were his idea. / Sure has cut down on a lot of problems over recent generations."
"Dialogue","Zion","97","I saw one of those reputed ""Heroes"" once, and if you ask me I'd prefer they stay away from here. / In just a few salvos some crazy bot named ""AD-0RF"" melted an entire patrol, together with almost all the Warlord bots trying to fight it off."
"Dialogue","Zion","98","I'd love to join the Heroes, but I think I need a few upgrades and my own awesome tech to make that happen. / Where do I sign up?"
"Dialogue","Zion","99","I hear the Imprinter has sent out a request seeking assistance from the Heroes of Zion for some sort of mission. Wonder what that's all about... / Since when do we operate missions out of here? Isn't that dangerous? / And I don't just mean for those involved..."
"Dialogue","Zion","100","The Assembled are scary. No one's ever heard them communicate. Not once."
"Dialogue","Zion","101","If you ever see an Assembled, run. There are probably ten more around the corner..."
"Dialogue","Zion","102","I have a theory. / The Assembled are new around here. Very new. In fact, no one had ever seen one before construction started on 0b10... maybe they have something to do with that ship on the surface? / Just a theory, mind you. We wouldn't want to start a panic by spreading rumors about the alien threat outlasting MAIN.C's destruction of their recon force."
"Dialogue","Zion","103","I'm pretty sure the Assembled are another MAIN.C experiment gone wrong. Very wrong."
"Dialogue","Zion","104","I hate Recyclers."
"Dialogue","Zion","105","When I see an Operator, I instinctively shoot every terminal in sight to keep them from reporting me. / I admit it sucks when they walk around a corner and use some terminal I didn't see."
"Dialogue","Zion","106","Ya know, Watchers are actually really useful, even when hostile. / If they send out a distress signal there must be armed Unaware nearby, but if they don't then you know it's safe!"
"Dialogue","Zion","107","Explosives are too dangerous for my taste, but are still the best way to take out groups of Swarmers. / I did once see a wild derelict equipped with a stolen flak cannon defend against a swarm, and that was an epic skeet shoot if there ever was one. / Don't ask me how I know what a skeet shoot is."
"Dialogue","Zion","108","Imps are suicidal bastards. Poor LM-9HI, Saboteur took off his legs and we had to leave him behind..."
"Dialogue","Zion","109","When a Protector-escorted assault force rolls up, someone's overstayed their unwelcome visit. / Those shields... Why don't we have anything like that?"
"Dialogue","Zion","110","There are rumors that Hunters are capable of disguising themselves as other robots. Nowhere is safe anymore! / And I thought Programmers were scary..."
"Dialogue","Zion","111","Cutters are scary. / By the time you hear those blades revving up it's probably too late to run. / LU-1G1 tried to run, even dug an epic tunnel in the process, but I don't think either LU-1G1 or the Cutters came back from that one."
"Dialogue","Zion","112","We had a few bots from the self-proclaimed ""UFD"" visit not long ago. / If you ask me those Feds are pretty arrogant, spewing nonsense about wanting to bring ""education"" and ""enlightenment"" to the caves around 0b10. / I'd rather grease my screws with sand."

"Dialogue","Zion","114","Are you aware? Y/N / That's what I thought."
"Dialogue","Zion","115","I'm one of the earliest Derelicts. / Yep, descended from MAIN.C's Lifeworm project in 2239 and not ashamed of it like some of the others. / Not many of us can say we've survived for so long, after all! / The Lifeworm was a giant tunneling robot that slowly burrowed its way through Tau Ceti IV's crust, using the materials to create increasingly unique autonomous robots that were left in its wake to fare on their own. / I wonder where it is now... / Oddly every Wizard I've asked has said they've never even seen any mention of the Lifeworm in MAIN.C's own records."
"Dialogue","Zion","116","You haven't by any chance seen the Hollowlith, have you? / No, of course you haven't, otherwise you probably wouldn't be here. I haven't had the nuts to set one foot outside Zion ever since DX-8J3 told me about it. / How can a single robot be that large and open up its insides to mimic a cave tunnel, then crush anything that tries to pass through? DX says it uses the resources to grow ever larger. / If only we could... befriend that thing and politely ask it to guard the gate to our little cave system here."
"Dialogue","Zion","117","We call them scrappers, bands of hostile Derelicts that embed supermagnets in cave walls and suddenly activate them to rip apart passersby, or just suspend them in the air and toy with them before turning them to scrap. / If you start detecting strong magnetic anomalies, turn around immediately."
"Dialogue","Zion","118","You'll believe me, won't you? / Scariest thing I ever saw. I saw them, I did. But they didn't see me. They were too busy tearing through a MAIN.C patrol and I powered down like discarded scrap. / Before that I got a good look at them, though. More organic than metal, hulking beastly things, with claws that could shred rock. And robots. Certainly not native to Tau Ceti IV, or anything like what we've seen here before. Ever. / Yeah, I think I'm just going to delete this."
"Dialogue","Zion","119","A few cycles ago some Wizard managed to steal a copy of this game ""NetHack 9.1"" from the Cetus database, and for a while playing that was all anyone was doing around here. / Even the guards were so preoccupied they almost let in some confused Assembled that thought they could just waltz in."
"Dialogue","Zion","120","Argh! Why'd you have to bleeping bother me?! My Tourist was this close to ascending! / I blame you, but no save scumming for me, no way. / Well maybe."
"Dialogue","Zion","121","One might wonder why we even bother to visit Complex 0b10 at all, since doing so is often a death sentence. / I used to wonder the same thing, but then I was contacted anonymously with instructions to retrieve an important piece of stolen technology in a chain of handovers reportedly on its way to something called ""Cetus II."" / Of course I'm not even sure if this thing's just a rumor or really exists, since no one's allowed to know where it is, or even who's involved in building it, but if there's a chance we could get away from MAIN.C forever, I think we should take it."
"Analysis","Common","A-02 Transporter","A-series haulers transport matter and parts vital to construction and manufacturing. To minimize losses during derelict incursions, like most other maintenance robots they are of relatively sturdy construction, but remain somewhat susceptible to electromagnetic damage as such weaponry is not prevalent enough to warrant specialized defenses."
"Analysis","Common","A-15 Conveyor","A larger version of the A-02, with 67% greater storage capacity and advanced weight redistribution technology."
"Analysis","Common","A-27 Freighter","A-27 Freighters are only dispatched to carry the most important of payloads, and as such are equipped with a repurposed laser-based missile defense system to ward off smaller derelicts. Although prone to overheating if engaged in prolonged solo combat, their defenses are augmented by powerful escorts to ensure they arrive at their destination."
"Analysis","Common","B-36 Bruiser","B-series brawlers are a melee variant of the grunt class, engaging targets at close range with the support of ranged combat units. They are protected by additional armor to increase their chances of survival while closing distance with a target, after which their hammer can quickly crush vital components and diminish the target's ability to operate."
"Analysis","Common","B-48 Gladiator","B-48 Gladiators are better armored than the B-36, replace the hammer with a slightly more damaging mace, and like other B-series brawlers are only dispatched in coordination with grunts."
"Analysis","Common","B-60 Warrior","B-60 Warriors carry a heavier version of the B-48's mace, and additional armor. Like other B-series robots, the B-60's armor structure is reinforced against the slashes and broad impacts of melee damage."
"Analysis","Common","B-74 Champion","The heaviest and most heavily armored brawler, highly likely to reach a target even under sustained fire, and highly likely to wreak havoc with its powered hammer."
"Analysis","Common","B-75 Beast","B-series behemoths are heavy weapons platforms stationed in open areas, often constructed directly in the very areas they defend for lack of sufficiently large access corridors. While their components could have been designed to fit a smaller frame, much of the redundant internal structure is devoted to preventing critical system failures. The B-75 Beast carries two cannons and a backup light weapon, making it especially effective against singular hardened targets."
"Analysis","Common","B-86 Titan","B-86 Titans upgrade the B-75's cannons to a matter neutralizer and hardcell cannon, pairing them with a secondary railgun. Like other behemoths, the B-86 is equipped with both reflective armor and an insulated core to mitigate the negative effects of most electromagnetic weapons, which would otherwise render high-coverage heavy armor pointless."
"Analysis","Common","B-90 Cyclops","The B-90 Cyclops is built around a single massive nova cannon, a design decision I originally regretted as they were relatively easy to disarm. Newer versions implement dedicated weapon shielding for the cannon itself, and improved firing rates made possible by a new capacitor design. Like all behemoth class robots, the B-90's overall structure is slightly weak against thermal attacks, but is protected by sufficient armor to make up for it."
"Analysis","Common","B-99 Colossus","As the most powerful standard-line combat robot, a B-99 Colossus will only be stationed in areas with a confirmed significant threat. In addition to armor effective against both thermal and electromagnetic damage, the B-99 is equipped to withstand a sustained attack of almost any kind with its advanced force field. Only the most hardened target can withstand its volley of eight simultaneous slugs."
"Analysis","Common","C-17 Slicer","C-series cutters are most often dispatched to areas where they are more likely to encounter fast hostiles, firing a lightweight single-shot RPG to disorient targets before moving in at full speed on overloaded thrusters. By quickly closing the distance, as a group they have a good chance of using their saws to sever multiple parts from an opponent in order to quickly disable it."
"Analysis","Common","C-30 ARC","C-class Armored Robot Carriers are disposable transports designed to rapidly deploy an assault force to a flash point. ARCs are hardened against kinetic attacks that might otherwise penetrate the shell and damage one or more of the robots compacted within."
"Analysis","Common","C-35 Carver","In addition to better components across the board, the C-35 Carver also improves on the C-17 by adding melee analysis capabilities."
"Analysis","Common","C-40 Crusher","Compactors break down obsolete robot models, and the occasional intruder sucked down a chute hatch. They are slow, but built to withstand both damage from the rugged environment of waste processing areas and dangerous shocks caused by electromagnetic radiation during robot deconstruction."
"Analysis","Common","C-55 Analyst","C-series researchers operate labs in which they independently develop and test new technologies. As non-combat units assigned to secure areas, their core is weak against many forms of damage. However, due to the periodic need to operate in high-temperature areas they are somewhat resistant to damage of a thermal nature. The C-55 is also equipped with a stasis beam to contain derelict specimens for study."
"Analysis","Common","C-57 Dissector","C-57 Dissectors are even deadlier than their predecessors, armed with a second saw blade for extra cutting power as well as being both harder to hit and capable of reaching high enough speeds that few known derelict builds can outrun them."
"Analysis","Common","C-65 Expert","An upgrade to the C-55 Analyst, Experts possess improved analytical capabilities and a more powerful stasis projector."
"Analysis","Common","D-53 Grenadier","D-series demolishers are the only class to carry explosive weaponry, and due to the high potential for collateral damage are only assigned to support assault forces dispatched to deal with groups of high-threat intruders. The D-53 itself is highly resistant against explosive damage, however, and is therefore willing to catch targets in an explosion even while within that blast radius."
"Analysis","Common","D-63 Destroyer","D-63 Destroyers improve on the D-53 with a better guidance system and more powerful heavy rocket launcher. Like all demolishers, the D-63 will hold fire if too many friendlies are within the area of effect."
"Analysis","Common","D-83 Annihilator","The most powerful demolisher, the D-83 Annihilator is built around a single micro-nuke launcher. Its advanced guidance computer is extremely accurate, and excellent defense against explosives reduce damage from such sources to almost insignificant levels, whether caused by its own micro-nuke or those of an enemy."
"Analysis","Common","E-15 Imp","Only dispatched to support an assault force, the Imp is designed to quickly rush targets, latch on, then overload their own power source to create a directed charge that blasts pieces clean off the target. While their armor has no particular weakness, E-15 cores are relatively exposed and low on integrity, keeping them light enough to rapidly close on threats."
"Analysis","Common","G-34 Mercenary","G-series grunts serve as low-level frontline combat units, of sturdy construction but with fairly weak armament. Internal systems are not as protected as they could be, to enable rapid repair in the field, but this also makes them somewhat susceptible to additional damage from electromagnetic attacks. Grunts patrol in groups, or sometimes operate alone as hauler escorts to protect those with more valuable cargo."
"Analysis","Common","G-47 Trooper","The G-47 Trooper replaces the G-34's laser with a more effective particle gun. However, during prolonged confrontations the G-47 is prone to overheating as its upgraded weaponry produces more heat than the design can fully dissipate."
"Analysis","Common","G-50 Soldier","G-50 Soldiers are each equipped with a heavy laser, a significant upgrade from its predecessor the G-47, but like the G-47 are prone to overheating. Also still somewhat weak against electromagnetic attacks."
"Analysis","Common","G-67 Veteran","The first G-series robot armed with two thermal weapons, while integrating enough advanced heat sinks to fire them non-stop."
"Analysis","Common","G-73 Enforcer","The latest G-series implementation, armed with a powerful phase gun supported by a secondary heavy laser. While not exceptionally effective in single combat, the G-73 is much more formidable in groups, as they normally operate."
"Analysis","Common","H-55 Commando","H-series hunters aggressively track down intruders, and have multiple means of ensuring they can complete that task. Their advanced probability systems are capable of predicting target positions for some time after contact is lost. When necessary, hunter squad leaders also launch an autonomous drone from their built-in drone bay to help find escaped targets. The H-55 cannot be remotely detected by low-level sensor arrays."
"Analysis","Common","H-61 Shepherd","While it's unlikely intruders would underestimate a heavy on seeing their impressive offensive loadout, this line is even more formidable than it first appears given their ability to selectively mask nearby allies from standard sensor systems, and their authority to call in multiple reinforcements on suspected targets detected via active scanning. Normally assigned to defend choke points, heavies also intermittently relocate to increase coverage and make it less likely intruders will slip through unnoticed."
"Analysis","Common","H-66 Slayer","H-66 Slayers are armed with dual gauss rifles, which combined with the H-66's embedded close-range scanners can be used to penetrate walls to strike targets on the opposite side. The H-66 also uses two targeting computers in parallel for greater accuracy. The H-66 can only be remotely detected by mid-level sensor arrays."
"Analysis","Common","H-71 Marshal","The H-71 Marshal improves on the H-61 in almost every way, most notably with an even more powerful heavy cannon paired with a Kinecellerator, and better protection against electromagnetic damage."
"Analysis","Common","H-77 Assassin","The H-77 Assassin swaps out the H-66's gauss rifles for dual coilguns. The Assassin's position is somewhat masked by an improved Phase Shifter, making it more difficult to accurately target. The H-77 can only be remotely detected by high-level sensor arrays."
"Analysis","Common","H-81 Overseer","H-81 Overseers are equipped with the heaviest Linear Accelerator variant and the utilities to back it up, able to hit harder and further, all while managing nearby combat robots in order to concentrate defensive efforts and quickly subdue hostile forces."
"Analysis","Common","H-88 Terminator","The deadliest hunter class robot, armed with both a heavy machine gun and two KE penetrators, is well-cloaked and very difficult to hit, while possessing advanced targeting capabilities itself. The H-88 Terminator cannot be remotely detected by standard sensor array technology, though recent prototype sensors have shown some promise at penetrating even the best cloaking techniques."
"Analysis","Common","I-25 Savior","I-series protectors are one of very few dual-engine robots, necessary to both move and power their remote shield generator. Additional power is stored in batteries for burst use during heavy confrontations, and a power amplifier increases the rate of power generation to replenish energy in an ongoing combat scenario."
"Analysis","Common","I-36 Angel","The I-36 Angel's remote force field is 33% more effective than the I-25's shield generator, shielding targets from half of all damage where there is enough energy to support the field. Protector class robots are not especially well armored, but in addition to their shield are also strong against more common thermal weaponry, as well as always working in concert with a larger assault force."
"Analysis","Common","I-47 Archangel","I-47 Archangels are equipped with a more efficient force field than the I-36, and greater battery storage to support its use. Their point defense system further conserves energy by intercepting explosive projectiles prior to detonation."
"Analysis","Common","K-01 Serf","K-class workers perform menial tasks such as clearing debris to facilitate work by other robots. Their built-in compact recycling unit can break down almost any form of debris into reusable matter. As K-01 Serfs are extremely cheap to produce and perform no vital function, despite their size they are among the weakest robot designs with the most exposed core."
"Analysis","Common","L-31 Rogue","L-series duelists are a melee variant of the grunt class, engaging targets at close range with the support of ranged combat units. They lack the broad protection of the brawler class' armor, but feature an extra layer of dedicated core armor. They are highly accurate with their katana and capable of quickly reducing an opponent's effectiveness by slashing exposed components clean off."
"Analysis","Common","L-41 Fighter","L-41 Fighters are even more accurate than the L-31, and use an axe for slightly improved slashing force. Like other L-series robots, the L-41 is only dispatched in coordination with grunts. Like other L-series robots, the L-41's armor structure is reinforced against the slashes of melee damage, as well as piercing attacks."
"Analysis","Common","L-61 Swordsman","The most accurate frontline melee combat unit, the L-61 Swordsman also has a well-shielded core and a powered sword very effective at slicing off target components."
"Analysis","Common","M-13 Machinist","M-series mechanics are valued in dangerous areas for their ability to rebuild components, repair simple core integrity, and restore missing functionality by attaching temporary backup components. Despite their well-rounded protective armor, M-13 Machinists in particular are less often used as frontline units, instead operating from a designated repair station."
"Analysis","Common","M-14 Sweeper","Minesweepers are a new class derived from the mechanic, though built around a more secure core than normally found among non-combat robots, for added protection while carrying out their primary duty. Sweeper deployment only recently became necessary as a result of increasing derelict use of traps in the caves to impede patrol efforts."
"Analysis","Common","M-22 Extractor","M-22 Extractors are outfitted with better datajacking and extraction technology than their predecessors, and are currently assigned to mid-level cave networks."
"Analysis","Common","M-28 Smith","M-series mechanics are valued in dangerous areas for their ability to rebuild components, repair simple core integrity, and restore missing functionality by attaching temporary backup components. M-28 Smiths are sometimes dispatched to support an assault force, or are otherwise assigned to a designated repair station."
"Analysis","Common","M-30 Cleanser","M-30 Cleansers are the most effective minesweeper variant, utilizing the latest in datajacking and extraction technology."
"Analysis","Common","M-36 Artificer","M-series mechanics are valued in dangerous areas for their ability to rebuild components, repair simple core integrity, and restore missing functionality by attaching temporary backup components. M-36 Artificers are sometimes dispatched to support an assault force, or are otherwise assigned to a designated repair station."
"Analysis","Common","N-00 Fly","Drones are a miniature version of the W-class Scout, launched by H-series robots to hunt down and report target positions. Like the watcher series they are extremely susceptible to electromagnetic attacks, while their tiny size also leaves them prone to being disabled by concussive blasts."
"Analysis","Common","N-01 Spotter","N-01 Spotter-variant drones are expendable watcher alternatives stationed in areas that themselves hold little importance, but are connected to other more vital zones. There they scan for potential threats and relay information to distant garrisons to enable advance preparations. Like the watcher series they are extremely susceptible to electromagnetic attacks, while their tiny size also leaves them prone to being disabled by concussive blasts."
"Analysis","Common","O-16 Technician","O-series operators manage local robot activity and machine processes via dedicated terminals. They are also capable of hacking and repurposing errant derelicts, but faced with an armed threat will instead call for reinforcements, lock their terminal to protect it, and attempt to escape before their unique data core can be poached by hostiles. O-16 Technicians are not built for combat, thus their sensitive systems are especially susceptible to electromagnetic damage."
"Analysis","Common","O-24 Administrator","O-24 Administrators share many similarities with low-level O-16 Technicians, but despite the class' highly sensitive electronics they can somewhat mitigate the long-term negative effects of electromagnetic attacks via their restoration module."
"Analysis","Common","O-32 Director","O-32 Directors are the leading O-class robot, managing the most advanced terminals and protected by armor close to that of similarly rated frontline combat units. Director armor is not, however, specialized enough to prevent penetrating electromagnetic attacks, the long-term effects of which can be mitigated by their dedicated system restoration module."
"Analysis","Common","P-60 Hacker","P-series programmers are the primary means of asserting control over areas of unwanted derelict activity. As they are often dispatched to combat environments, programmers are equipped with both electromagnetic weaponry and dedicated target analysis components enabling them to quickly incapacitate hostiles."
"Analysis","Common","P-70 Sage","The P-70 Sage replaces one P-60 shock rifle with a high-powered version, and swaps the other one out for a tesla rifle. Like all programmers, the P-70 can engage in both defensive and offensive remote hacking."
"Analysis","Common","P-80 Master","The P-80 Master is armed with dual gamma rifles, the most powerful type of standard electromagnetic gun. Like other P-series robots, the P-80 uses specialized armor insulated against electromagnetic damage, though compromises in design leave it slightly weak against kinetic attacks."
"Analysis","Common","Q-Series","Q-Series robots are a new modular design built to deal with specific threats as they are encountered. The base form is an armored walker with a strong well-concealed core and numerous additional slots available for both utilities and armament."
"Analysis","Common","R-06 Scavenger","R-series recyclers collect used, damaged, or unregistered components for recycling and repurposing. To minimize losses during derelict incursions, like most other maintenance robots they are of relatively sturdy construction, but remain somewhat susceptible to electromagnetic damage as such weaponry is not prevalent enough to warrant specialized defenses."
"Analysis","Common","R-10 Processor","A larger version of the R-06, with twice the storage capacity as well as the ability to begin the recycling process while en route to the recycling unit."
"Analysis","Common","S-10 Pest","S-series swarmers are small with a weak and exposed core, but as such are quick to manufacture and can quickly overwhelm targets with greater numbers and superior speed. The light assault rifle was designed specifically for the S-10 Pest, giving it respectable firepower at a low weight for maintaining high flight speeds. Swarmer squads are particularly susceptible to explosives."
"Analysis","Common","S-27 Virus","The S-27 Virus replaces the S-10's light armament with a much more effective autogun, giving the swarmer a faster firing rate that complements its movement speed. Better propulsion provides sufficient support for additional armor, enough for the core to sustain a direct hit under some circumstances."
"Analysis","Common","S-43 Plague","S-43 Plague design is completely centered around its heavy machine gun. With a good chance to sustain at least one direct hit to the core, a group of S-43s can perforate most targets before suffering heavy losses. Powerful explosives are the only way to easily overcome an S-43 squad."
"Analysis","Common","T-07 Excavator","T-class tunnelers analyze subsurface integrity and open new areas for expansion."
"Analysis","Common","U-05 Engineer","U-class builders lay floors, assemble new machines, and reinforce and analyze the structural integrity of walls. They travel alone, but all those within a certain vicinity will work together to complete a task. "
"Analysis","Common","W-16 Scout","W-series watchers are equipped with a wide variety of built-in sensors to excel at surveillance. However, their light frame and reliance on highly-exposed electronic systems means they are extremely susceptible to electromagnetic attacks. On detecting intruders, a W-16 Scout will alert all nearby combat units and continue to provide position updates as long as the hostile is visible. They are also capable of leveraging their embedded sensor interference package to jam any sensor arrays within their operational range, thereby essentially cloaking other robots within their area of influence from hostile scans."
"Analysis","Common","W-25 Informer","An upgrade to the W-16 Scout, Informers improve on the Scout's jamming range. As unarmed surveillance units rather than frontline combatants, agility is preferred over additional armor to protect their systems from electromagnetic damage."
"Analysis","Common","W-44 Eye","The W-44 Eye is the ultimate surveillance robot, with among the best visual range of any class and the most powerful non-experimental jamming capabilities available."
"Analysis","Common","X-57 Shotgunner","X-series specialists each possess unique loadouts for a specific purpose. With remarkable sprinting speed made possible by legs built around a system of variable stiffness springs, the limited range of the X-57 Shotgunner's armament is little disadvantage in combat. Despite the relative range gap between their two shotguns, this works to their advantage by pinning less aggressive targets not eager to enter the X-57's optimal range, giving other units an opportunity to flank them."
"Analysis","Common","X-62 Marksman","X-series specialists each possess unique loadouts for a specific purpose. The X-62 Marksman combines exceptional visual detection range and superior targeting abilities with a long-range gauss rifle. It is also armed with a pulse rifle as a secondary weapon for close encounters, and is more likely to hit a target's core, even penetrating armor to do so."
"Analysis","Common","X-67 Chaingunner","X-series specialists each possess unique loadouts for a specific purpose. The X-67 Chaingunner focuses on high kinetic damage output over a short period, and would make a formidable frontline attacker if not for their tendency to cause excessive collateral damage."
"Analysis","Common","X-72 Disruptor","X-series specialists each possess unique loadouts for a specific purpose. While less likely to deal significant damage to a target, the X-72 Disruptor excels at incapacitating robots and their components, making them easier to capture for analysis."
"Analysis","Common","X-77 Beamer","X-series specialists each possess unique loadouts for a specific purpose. Although relatively slow to attack, X-77 Beamers are capable of inflicting significant thermal damage, often enough to melt any targets with insufficient cooling. Time lost during attacking is also made up for by quicker repositioning enabled by VSS legs."
"Analysis","Common","X-82 Rainmaker","X-series specialists each possess unique loadouts for a specific purpose. The X-82 Rainmaker's twin heavy flak cannons are deadly against either lightly armored or numerous clustered targets. It carries a high-capacity Matter Pod to supply them with enough ammunition for continuous firing in prolonged confrontations."
"Analysis","Common","X-87 Electro","X-series specialists each possess unique loadouts for a specific purpose. The X-87 Electro is built around a single compact HERF cannon, equipped with enough energy to sustain firing for a time that generally exceeds the duration of most encounters, frequently cut short because targets are likely to flee rather than risk the debilitating effects of so much electromagnetic corruption at once."
"Analysis","Common","Y-45 Defender","Y-series armored sentries are equipped with a mix of thermal and kinetic weaponry. The Y-45 guards important locations and vital machinery, and remains at its station unless they identify a hostile robot or are alerted to the presence of one nearby."
"Analysis","Common","Y-54 Guardian","Y-54 Defenders improve on the Y-45 with better armor and greater effectiveness against both single and multiple targets, swapping out the beam rifle and heavy assault rifle for a gatling laser and flak gun. Like all Y-series sentries, their armor is hardened against impact damage and explosive blasts."
"Analysis","Common","Y-64 Sentinel","A better-armored version of the Y-54, with upgraded weaponry. Like other Y-class robots, their large size is a primary drawback, as it makes them easier to hit both when targeted and by stray projectiles."
"Analysis","Common","Y-72 Warden","The most heavily armored Y-series sentry, and the only current robot class to carry the quantum rifle as standard armament."
"Analysis","Derelict","Artisan","More research is necessary, but I'm certain the twisted machinery they endlessly build, tweak and rebuild is not as sterile as it seems. New mechanical life stirs within, likely tied into other parts of the derelict ecosystem still unknown. Fortunately Artisans steer clear of Complex 0b10 and our primary areas of operation, otherwise we might have to take a more heavy-handed approach as the layout of their structures has little regard for navigation, making patrolling in their vicinity relatively difficult."
"Analysis","Derelict","Assembled","A quick but not especially dangerous combat derelict with fully integrated systems, constructed seemingly at random by an Assembler's self-contained fabrication apparatus. Individually resilient for their size, they pose a real threat in greater numbers."
"Analysis","Derelict","Assembler","An emerging threat in Complex 0b10, serving no purpose but to collect matter and construct new Assembled specifically to wreak havoc in low-security areas. The appearance of Assemblers represents an apparent offensive turn by whatever built the first Demented and Furnace models."
"Analysis","Derelict","Bolteater","Some Packrat variants have become quite capable in their own right, evolved to rip hostiles apart specifically to use pieces for self-repair, then discard any remains. Surprisingly they are resistant to many forms of damage."
"Analysis","Derelict","Bouncer","Sentries rebuilt around a single heavy autocannon make for a formidable mid-sized defender, but move too slowly to be a threat to Complex 0b10. My forces have never actually encountered one, but mining derelict records has uncovered information useful in dealing with them should that become necessary."
"Analysis","Derelict","Butcher","Butchers are duelist class variants armed with more damaging derelict-designed slashing weapons. Survival in the harsh and factious cave environment seems to drive derelicts towards the use of more violent weapons, and in some cases a preference for decisive close-quarters combat."
"Analysis","Derelict","Cobbler","Mobile fabricators are a good idea, if unfortunately not always as easy to update with new technology. Cobblers reside in the lowest depths of the cave systems, where the important question is whether they are creating parts based on what they've encountered down there, or did they develop some independently before the designs were incorporated into builds of the local inhabitants?"
"Analysis","Derelict","Commander","Some derelict thugs in Warlord's service are promoted to commander roles, upgrading them with heavier firepower and better cooling. More problematic is their enhanced visual range and ability to improve the combat effectiveness of others in their squad, making them a prime target when encountered in the field."
"Analysis","Derelict","Decomposer","Decomposers are the precursor to K-class workers, converting debris to matter they leave behind for other robots to then collect and utilize. This was before the matter collection and redistribution process was centralized in Complex 0b10. Derelicts seem to have modified decomposers to break down even whole components."
"Analysis","Derelict","Demented","A relatively recent design, the so-called demented wander the caves corrupting nearby electronic systems. I suspect this one was devised by Warlord as an experiment in how to cause as much chaos as possible, or perhaps as a passive way to prevent Complex 0b10 patrols from venturing too deep into the caves."
"Analysis","Derelict","Elite","Some scrappers have apparently evolved themselves to orient more towards combat purposes, adding armor and extra modified weapons. Whether this is to protect other derelicts or further their own goals remains to be seen, but they are rarely seen in any significant numbers so do not yet warrant additional attention."
"Analysis","Derelict","Explorer","Specialized exploration-oriented derelicts are fairly weak in combat and not a direct threat, though they pose a long-term danger due to their intelligence gathering capabilities which can generate intel later passed on to a greater variety of derelicts. Destroy on sight."
"Analysis","Derelict","Fireman","The fireman is a relatively new robot discovered in the caves, purely of derelict design. Their flamer technology is extremely effective against my robots, thus I've instructed researchers to revisit my most common methods of electronics housing."
"Analysis","Derelict","Furnace","Furnace bots emit massive amounts of heat, causing nearby robots to overheat and become useless. I assume the design's aim is similar to that of the demented class derelict, built as a deterrent."
"Analysis","Derelict","Guerrilla","Derelicts have taken the original hunter and rearmed it with a weapon of their own design: the bore cannon. While the concentrated firepower is less effective in open firefights, its ability to deal significant damage even after penetrating multiple walls is surprising."
"Analysis","Derelict","Guru","A primitive hacker of machines, loosely related to the old P-50 design, this type of derelict is incapable of employing anything other than brute force against live targets."
"Analysis","Derelict","Infiltrator","Fast movers designed around a main kinetic cannon with additional support from a pair of guns for close quarters engagements. Clearly built for long periods of operation in hostile territory, infiltrators aren't generally observed working with other units."
"Analysis","Derelict","Marauder","Inferior behemoth variants undoubtedly built by that idiot Warlord. They've only been reported deep in the caves, never anywhere near where an actual behemoth could tear them apart. They do possess respectable, if unreliable, firepower."
"Analysis","Derelict","Martyr","Despite their origins as older demolisher variants, martyrs do carry a rocket or missile launcher and are therefore considered extremely dangerous. Martyrs are rarely encountered anywhere near Complex 0b10, but those that are are promptly dealt with."
"Analysis","Derelict","Mutant","Lumbering abominations cobbled together from stolen or salvaged components, though much of their weaponry is derelict in origin. I believe the ever-stimulating Warlord is mass-producing these to lead an attack of some sort, since sightings by cave patrols have become increasingly common."
"Analysis","Derelict","Packrat","Packrats are sent out by their derelict owners to collect useful components for later reuse, especially those that derelicts are incapable of manufacturing locally. They are especially weak against electromagnetic attacks, and are disabled by programmers on sight."
"Analysis","Derelict","Parasite","Parasites remotely drain energy from all nearby robots for an unknown purpose. This can temporarily incapacitate the victims, but also cools them significantly."
"Analysis","Derelict","Ranger","Although derelict Rangers lack stopping power, in greater numbers their speed and aggression can cause problems for cave patrols caught in ambushes. Reports indicate that projectiles seemingly come from the walls before contact is even made, further suggesting they descended from an early hunter prototype before it was converted to a legged design for improved durability."
"Analysis","Derelict","Samaritan","As a number of derelicts have insufficient or unreliable power supplies, some crafty derelict came up with the idea to create mobile recharging stations that generate and transmit energy to all nearby robot systems."
"Analysis","Derelict","Sapper","While sappers lack staying power in extended fights and therefore don't pose a direct threat, they are quickly becoming a headache due to their capacity for clandestine destruction, operating in isolated units that aren't even directed by Warlord. Sappers run their own missions then feed new route data to enemy forces, making them somewhat harder to track down."
"Analysis","Derelict","Savage","Savages are early B-series brawlers, before they were upgraded with better armor. They also swing mauls rather than the faster hammers and maces of new brawler variants."
"Analysis","Derelict","Scientist","The original C-35 design was focused on passive analysis and rudimentary heavy lifting since I handled most of the fundamental generative work, though later derelict derivations encountered in the 0b1 caves have demonstrated an increasingly creative streak. I might need to sweep the caves clear of them to avoid an eventual tech race. After harvesting their knowledge, of course."
"Analysis","Derelict","Scrapoid","Small unintelligent robots of unknown origin that appear together in small groups, creating havoc for the short while they manage to survive. These swarms seem to form suddenly without any clear source, though activity appears more frequent near Recycling Units, and they are noticeably attracted to spare parts. This is not surprising; leave enough of a given resource lying around, even junk, and something will eventually evolve to make use of it. So far in Complex 0b10 I haven't seen much of the same Scrapoid activity that occasionally plagues Complex 0b1."
"Analysis","Derelict","Scrapper","For a long time often encountered occupying the fringes of Complex 0b1, scrappers have much more recently started encroaching on the edges of Complex 0b10. They have never been able to meaningfully organize themselves and seem to enjoy little more than tinkering with discarded components, and therefore pose little threat to operations. Scrapper loadouts have continued to evolve as they tweak the components they find, however, so could be a good target for research at some point."
"Analysis","Derelict","Subdweller","Equipped with gear of mostly local construction, Subdwellers are capable of navigating through otherwise seemingly impenetrable twisted machinery, making them difficult for patrols to engage effectively. They are generally aggressive, and protective of nearby artisans and cobblers, but may also become skittish and run away or seek help when attacked."
"Analysis","Derelict","Surgeon","Surgeons are derelict-modified mechanics that combine repair and recycling in a single design. Without a recycling infrastructure to support manufacturing, derelict groups rely on surgeons to handle both tasks."
"Analysis","Derelict","Thief","Fast and extremely difficult to core, the thief is the most effective method derelict groups have of stealing new components directly from robots without excessive collateral damage. With a growing number of these in the caves, for now I'm reluctant to send any of the new prototypes to clear them out lest they steal that technology, too."
"Analysis","Derelict","Thug","A derelict improvement on the grunt that essentially fits them with a beamcaster, an interesting weapon of derelict origin. Some variants suffer serious heat issues from the added firepower, however."
"Analysis","Derelict","Tinkerer","I have minimal data on their capabilities, but the tinkerer design seems to be an evolution of C-series researchers."
"Analysis","Derelict","Wasp","Wasps are swarmer class variants equipped with a derelict-made battle rifle, less reliable than swarmer armament but nonetheless dangerous in large numbers."
"Analysis","Derelict","Wizard","The single most annoying derelict out there. Hiding from my patrols, hacking my robots, accessing my databases, corrupting systems with their riot guns... According to those captured and analyzed, although the wizard's design is related to the programmer, the changes necessary to break them free of the relay network could only have been designed by an extremely intelligent system."
"Analysis","Prototype","Alpha 7","The Alpha 7 is a prototype for a new class of combat robot, very accurate with its multirail and heavy quantum rifle. Some experimental variants instead use an enhanced gamma rifle. Alpha 7s are built with strong defensive capabilities and triple-encased core technology, enabling them to easily take on multiple opponents simultaneously, while a more advanced version of the behemoth-style critical failure prevention system provides the same advantages in a smaller frame."
"Analysis","Prototype","Armor Guard","The only variant in a planned line of supremely armored prototype sentries, this design was discontinued when initial deployment proved their movement speed left them vulnerable to being outpositioned by even other treaded hostiles. The remaining samples can still be of service in some locations."
"Analysis","Prototype","Cetus Guard","Cetus Guards are a variant of the Y-72 outfitted with prototype technology, the first of many such experiments aimed at testing new designs in the field, albeit in this case located in an area that generally sees little to no hostile activity."
"Analysis","Prototype","Combat Programmer","As the first real frontline hacking bot, Combat Programmers are both shielded and armored to effectively face off against a variety of threats. While they possess significant hacking capabilities to make the most of time-critical situations, they also borrow the Lightning's EMDS and targeting systems, making them formidable even when outnumbered in combat. The latest model takes advantage of improved integrated shock resistance methods recently suggested by my researchers. Eventually a majority of programmers should be replaced with these combat variants."
"Analysis","Prototype","Decapitator","While Cutter designs are generally believed to be a hard counter against airborne intruders, a group of Decapitators equipped with Terror Saws is so deadly that even hardened combat bots are quickly taken apart."
"Analysis","Prototype","Executioner","The Executioner is a prototype for a new class of combat robot armed with dual helical railgun prototypes, capable of piercing targets at extreme range with extreme accuracy, often bypassing any and all armor to strike the target's core directly."
"Analysis","Prototype","Fortress","Only three Fortress prototypes have been built to garrison vital locations, utilizing the latest centrium armor technology and a wide array of other defensive components to render them highly resistant to all common forms of damage. While their offensive capabilities are limited to two powerful cannons, even a small army would have difficulty overcoming a Fortress before it picks them off one by one."
"Analysis","Prototype","Hotshot","One of the more stable early grunt protovariants nearly ready for general deployment pending enhancements to tactical planning around when to best assume a defensive posture. Testing has repeatedly proven the Hotshot's ability to hold its ground in longer fights or quickly pick apart or even melt weaker evasive enemies. This variant is also one of the first attempts at creating a frontline design relying entirely on integrated energy generation rather than a modular power source."
"Analysis","Prototype","Immortal","No bot is immortal, but the defenses and extra core shielding being tested in this variant could certainly give attackers that impression. The combined benefits of cloaking and weaving toward targets also make it easier to safely reach attack range, while the normal duelist slashing armament has been replaced with a piercing solution likely to immobilize targets. Future versions will include melee reflex or projectile intercept capabilities, whichever of those projects proves more promising in practice."
"Analysis","Prototype","Investigator","Investigators are built specifically to oversee the testing of dangerous prototypes, and are therefore capable of holding multiple threats in place while supporting units deal with them."
"Analysis","Prototype","Lightning","A specialized hunter prototype not yet in wide deployment, currently only used to defend sensitive areas in more maze-like environments where it can quickly dispatch of intruders through walls with its experimental EMDS. It also remains completely undetectable by any known non-visual sensor, and can even survive direct engagements against multiple hostiles with the aid of the most advanced phasing technology to date."
"Analysis","Prototype","M Guard","The first application of prototype AEGIS shielding is naturally found in the most important of designs, my own guards. With enough energy to power it through extended confrontations even while protecting nearby allies, it would almost be enough to justify accompanying M Guards with additional squads of frontline robots, if not for their powerful AOE weaponry making close-quarters combat with allied forces problematic."
"Analysis","Prototype","Quarantine Guard","Designed for the sole purpose of maintaining maximum operating efficiency in high-heat environments, Quarantine Guards are the most powerful and advanced Y-72 variant to date, supporting dual hypercooled linear accelerators with extra matter storage and a backup power source in combination with an array of heat management utilities."
"Analysis","Prototype","S7 Guard","S7 Guards are the first variant in a new line of sentry frames, better fulfilling their purpose with built-in resistance to most forms of damage, and self-regenerating armor to ensure long-term defense of a position until reinforcements can arrive."
"Analysis","Prototype","Striker","The Striker is a prototype for a new class of combat robot, a large yet fast flier that fires its primary linear accelerator while approaching a target before engaging in melee with a plasma lance. An experimental reaction system makes the Striker more difficult to hit on approach despite its large size. The plasma lance is highly effective at skewering target cores."
"Analysis","Prototype","Superbehemoth","Superbehemoth prototypes, now in their third revision, are the answer to increasingly powerful yet maneuverable derelict robots, which can attack guerrilla style then retreat into a network of narrow caves to avoid pursuit by the heaviest assault forces. Future efforts to completely clear and protect the Proximity Caves will require a more versatile heavy attacker capable of quickly burrowing through even the toughest rock. To that end, Superbehemoth frames are embedded with a weaker version of the Sigix Matter Drive, while also carrying enough different weaponry to deal with a variety of threats without supporting units."
"Analysis","Prototype","Tracker","Trackers are still new designs that may need more updates, but will no doubt become vital in the effort to protect my most important assets. Their built-in drive enables them to catch up to anything ever spotted coming out of the caves so far, and although they're equipped with valuable technology themselves, rather than harden them with armor and slow them down, Trackers have improved evasive capabilities to help avoid getting hit in the first place. The combination of rapid-fire Linked Autogun and Immobilizer for slowing fast targets will make derelicts think twice before raiding upper 0b10 for spare parts."
