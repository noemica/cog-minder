When appearing near an exit, some nearby Caves prefabs that normally have robots, such as 0b10 outposts may end up empty.\n\n\n[[Heading:2]]Behavior[[/Heading]]\nMaster Thieves dash towards Cogmind to try to steal one of their parts using [[Master Tearclaws]], prioritizing high rating parts and [[Exiles (Location)|Exiles]] prototypes. Upon success, they will start fleeing. If a fleeing Master Thief goes outside Cogmind's field of view, they will exit the map.\n\nUnlike regular Thieves, Master Thieves will only attack Cogmind, and will ignore all other robots.\n\n[[Heading:2]]Strategies[[/Heading]]\nMaster Thieves are incapable of taking parts on the ground, so dropping important parts you don't want to lose keeps them safe from them. Dropping your [[Storage Unit]] can help drop a lot of parts quickly, at the cost of not being able to choose which parts remain in inventory. However, this strategy can backfire if there are [[Dirty Bomb Trap|Dirty Bomb Traps]] or [[Decomposer|Decomposer]] nearby, or if Cogmind or other robots carry  [[Launchers]] or [[Electromagnetic Weapons]] capable of triggering chain reactions in power sources.\n\nIn order to actually destroy Master Thieves, Launchers can work well when aimed at walls next to them, though at close range the collateral damage might not be worth it if you don't have high-value parts. Targeting utilities can help actually hit them while they are approaching, and a Stasis Beam/Projector can prevent a single Master Thief from attacking or escaping while also making them easier to hit, at the cost of making them take 50% less damage.\n\nIf Cogmind is fast enough, fleeing is also an option, for example to lead the Master Thieves into 0b10 robots, [[Warlord]]-aligned derelicts or traps.\n\nLast edited during Beta 14."

It is arguably the most powerful robot in the game, capable of regenerating core integrity and parts as well as assembling large numbers of allies to its defense. It is initially dormant but can [[Protoforge#dormancy|wake up]] for a variety of reasons.\n[[Heading]]Part Assembling[[/Heading]]\nSuperfortress will assemble any destroyed non-weapon parts periodically. One destroyed part will be assembled roughly every 10 turns, although this number is variable. Weapons are instead periodically broken down and assembled instantly. As long as Superfortress has a least one weapon remaining, there will be no prioritization of reassembling weapons. However, if Superfortress runs out of weapons entirely, it will immediately reassemble a full set of weapons.\n[[Heading:2]]Weapon Reassembling[[/Heading]]\nSuperfortress initially has no weapons attached. Upon waking up, it will assemble a random selection of weapons. Superfortress will assemble 4 weapon slots worth of weapons each time it assembles weapons.\nTypical weapons are from the following list:\n[[Table]]\nPart|Slots||\n[[Cep. Heavy Railcannon]]|2||\n[[Cep. Helical Railcannon]]|1||\n[[Cep. Miniperforator]]|1||[[Cep. Plasma Driver]]|1||\n[[Cld. Nova Cannon]]|1||\n[[Enh. Hardcell Cannon]]|1||\n[[Graviton Cannon]]|1||\n[[Hvy. Hardcell Cannon]]|2||\n[[Null Cannon]]|1||\n[[Omega Cannon]]|2\n[[/Table]]\nWhen there are 10 or more bots in line of sight, Superfortress may assemble a [[Launchers|Launcher]] instead of one of its typical weapons. The available launchers are from the following list:\n[[List]]\n[[Cep. Arcsight Missile Launcher]]|\n[[Com. Tesla Bomb Launcher]]|\n[[Enh. Gamma Bomb Array]]|\n[[Fusion Bomb Launcher]]|\n[[Gamma Bomb Array]]|\n[[Gamma Driveblaster]]|\n[[Ragnarok Missile Launcher]][[/List]]\n[[Heading]]Robot Assembling[[/Heading]]\nWhen Superfortress is under fire or there are multiple  hostiles in line of sight, it will assemble allies to fight for it. The more hostiles are in line of sight, the more likely it is that Superfortress will assemble a new ally each turn. This can make it very difficult to maintain a numbers advantage over Superfortress. Bots assembled can be from the following list:\n[[List]]\n[[Decapitator]]|\n[[Executioner]]|\n[[H-88 Terminator]]|\n[[Hotshot]]|\n[[Immortal]]|\n[[P-80 Master]]|\n[[Striker]]|\n[[X-77 Beamer]]|\n[[X-82 Rainmaker]]|\n[[X-87 Electro]]\n[[/List]]\n[[Heading]]Killing Superfortress[[/Heading]]\nSee [[Strategy/Defeating Superfortress]]."

If successful, the Thief will flee, carrying the stolen part in their inventory. If a Thief in the process of fleeing is or goes outside Cogmind's field of view, they will exit the map.\n\nWhen trying to steal parts, Thieves might ignore unarmed robots and instead target Cogmind or combat robots.\n\n[[Heading:2]]Strategies[[/Heading]]\nThieves are incapable of taking parts on the ground, so dropping important parts you don't want to lose keeps them safe from them. However, this strategy can backfire if there are [[Dirty Bomb Trap|Dirty Bomb Traps]] or [[Decomposer|Decomposer]] nearby, or if Cogmind or other robots carry  [[Launchers]] or [[Electromagnetic Weapons]] capable of triggering chain reactions in power sources.\n\nMoving behind combat allies or swapping with them to place them closer to the Thieves can prevent your own parts getting stolen, at the cost of your allies'.\n\nIn order to actually destroy Thieves, Launchers can work well when aimed at walls next to the Thieves, though at close range the collateral damage might not be worth it. Targeting utilities can help actually hit them while they are approaching, and a Stasis Beam/Projector can prevent a single Thief from attacking or escaping while also making them easier to hit, at the cost of making them take 50% less damage.\n\n[[Blade Trap|Blade Traps]], [[Segregator Trap|Segregator Traps]] and [[Stasis Trap|Stasis Traps]] can work well in disarming or stopping Thieves, provided you have enough time to place them, for example before attacking a Thief ambush.\n\nIf Cogmind is fast enough, fleeing is also an option, for example to lead the Thieves into 0b10 robots, [[Warlord]]-aligned derelicts or traps.\n\n\nLast edited during Beta 14"

They typically guard machines or valuable part stockpiles while sitting slightly indented in the wall. Similar to [[Hunter|Hunters]], Behemoths will fire through walls in order to hit an enemy, which makes it hard to hide or run from them. Behemoths can even make use of [[Siege Mode]] to become more accurate and durable in combat. These combination of traits can make Behemoths terrifying encounters if not adequately prepared.\nBehemoths have innate EM resistance as well as corruption resistance through [[Dynamic Insulation System|Dynamic Insulation Systems]], so EM weaponry is a subpar weapon choice to get a quick kill. Melee weapons are undesirable to use because most Behemoths pack [[Ballistic Cannons]] that will frequently cause knockback. Behemoths have a minor thermal weakness, though that is slightly mitigated by thermal resistant armor. Meltdown criticals from thermal cannons can instantly destroy a Behemoth from full core integrity (100+), which can save a lot of damage and provide some good undamaged loot. Thermal guns are not effective in smaller numbers, but given enough heat transferring weapons (4+) it is possible to overload their standard cooling and [[Coolant Injectors]] to get the melt instant kill.\nBehemoths can be a desirable looting target for their weapons, cooling, treads, and armor. For this reason, applying some positive salvage via Electromagnetic weaponry or [[Salvage Targeting Computers]] can be a good idea. However, it can often be a better idea to run the other way. Even slow treads builds can get away from a pursuing Behemoth with good tactics. Despite their ability to tear through walls in their way, they have a tendency to get stuck unable to path through 1 tile wide corridors. If such corridors are nearby, use them to your advantage. Otherwise, try to cut between connected rooms to avoid traveling through so much of the line of fire. Behemoths will only shoot through up to 3 walls to cut a path, so if Cogmind can turn a corner or get a good angle on the Behemoth where it is unable to shoot, it is possible to wait out the memory.\nBehemoths are often found in their own spot inside a wall as part of a [[Security Squad]]. In [[Caves]], they can be found in a small square open area.\n[[Gallery]]Behemoths.png|All Behemoth variants and colors|Behemoth Guarded Stockpile.png|A Behemoth guarding a stockpile of parts, sitting in a recognizable \"Behemoth nook\"[[/Gallery]]\n\n[[Heading]][[CR-A16's Pointy Stick]]/[[CR-A16's Behemoth Slayer]][[/Heading]]\nA Pointy Stick has a chance to transform into a Behemoth Slayer when used to attack a Behemoth.

The best strategy to kill them is typically a point blank explosive [[Launchers|Launcher]] to the face, as they have high core exposure and low core integrity. Launchering a nearby wall also helps to work around their high evasion. Explosive machine arrays are especially good at dispatching a group of Cutters since they can't miss.

They are by far the most populous combat bot class, being found on nearly every map and in many different squad types. Most Grunts are not especially durable or threatening on their own, though at higher depths ([[Research]] +) they can be dangerous due to their tendency to appear in large groups. Veterans and Enforcers in particular have a significant jump in firepower due to the upgrade from 1 to 2 weapons.\nAll Grunts share a minor weakness to Electromagnetic damage, which makes EM or Impact the best damage types to use for quick destruction via [[Corruption]]. However, without any resistances to speak of, Grunts are fairly easily dispatched by any damage type. Grunts also tend to have barely adequate cooling, which means Thermal weaponry can can easily build up heat to trigger a [[Meltdown]].\nAnother way to deal with Grunts is to take advantage of their low memory (20 actions). It is trivial for airborne builds to leave Grunts in the dust, but even a reasonably speedy grounded build may be able to turn a corner and outrun Grunts long enough for them to give up chase.

Heavies have a powerful 2 slot Kinetic Cannon and are supported by a variety of offensive and defensive utilities, including the [[Graphene Brace]] that blocks all forms of criticals. Heavies, much like a [[Behemoth]], will attempt to fire through walls and machines in order to attack a target. Their unique [[Active Sensor Suite]] allows them to detect hostiles within a wide radius of 20 tiles, and Heavies may summon [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcements]] when bots are detected and when attacked. They will move between different guard positions whenever a [[Security Rotation]] occurs.\n[[Gallery]]Heavies.png|All Heavy variants and colors[[/Gallery]]\n\n[[Heading]]Active Sensor Suite Reinforcements[[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]HeavySensor.gif|Cogmind walking into detection range of a Heavy[[/Gallery]]\nWhen Cogmind enters Active Sensor Suite range, its radius will be indicated with a yellow flash. While a bot is in this radius, the Heavy may summon reinforcements based on the speed of the bot. If a bot has the [[Active Sensor Spoofer]], the reinforcements will be redirected to a location on the opposite side of the heavy. These reinforcements will not be summoned if the Heavy has active tracking on Cogmind. When a bot is detected, an alert will appear in the log:\n[[GameText]]ALERT: Suspicious intruders detected, dispatching specialist reinforcements to area.[[/GameText]]\nFaster bots (hover/flight users) detected will typically get [[Cutter|Cutters]] summoned, while all other bots will typically get [[Specialist|Specialists]]. An airborne build may want to go temporarily overweight to reduce the chance of Cutters being summoned. However, the chance is never 100% in either direction. Bots that are actively moving within the radius are more likely to get Reinforcements called, so if a Heavy is moving as part of a security rotation, it may be better to sit still and wait for it to walk by than to continue to move around. If Cogmind has [[Encrypted Comm Array]] support, summoned Specialists may turn out to be [[Infiltrator|Infiltrators]] instead.\n\n[[Heading]]Strategies[[/Heading]]\nHeavies are quite sturdy and offensively very powerful. Though there are no damage type weaknesses, they have few weaknesses that can be taken advantage of. While Heavies have sufficient cooling to handle their own weaponry, they are unable to dissipate large amounts of additional heat. Even though the Graphene Brace prevents burn criticals, a few thermal guns with decent heat transfer are still easily capable of melting down a Heavy. A high heat transfer gun like a [[Plasma Rifle]] is a good choice for this. Another weakness of the Heavy is a high dependency on its engine to power its variety of energy-hungry utilities. If its engine is destroyed or blown off, the Heavy will quickly become unable to attack. This is most easily achieved with the [[RIF]] hacks [[GameText]]overload_power[[/GameText]] and [[GameText]]amplify_resonance[[/GameText]].\nOn the other hand, inferior strategies to fight Heavies are EM and melee weaponry. All Heavies have a form of [[Dynamic Insulation Systems]], and all but the Shepherd have an additional [[EM Shield]] to lower EM damage. Killing via corruption is difficult, and may often take longer than killing with other types of damage. Melee attacks are all 50% resisted by a Heavy, and its cannon will knock back all but a treaded melee build.\nNearly every part on the Heavy makes for great salvage. Try to kill Heavies with salvage neutral weaponry if possible to get the great loot. Applying positive salvage with [[Salvage Targeting Computers]] is always beneficial. [[Transmission Jammers]] are very handy at preventing the additional reinforcements that come when a Heavy gets attacked. A Graphene Brace neutralizes the Blast critical from their cannons and will help protect Cogmind's fragile utilities. Heavies have a very short memory, so the best way to approach is often from a nearby room instead of running down the center of a corridor. If using a Jammer, always consider the Jammer range when approaching a Heavy for combat. Tanking a lot of additional hits to get into range is very unpleasant. If trying to escape a Heavy, the short memory may be an advantage. Once Cogmind turns a corner, the Heavy will often lose tracking before it catches back up unless it is able to shoot its way back into line of sight."

Kinetic builds may have more difficulty fighting Hunters due to their kinetic resistance, though they will appreciate the many Kinetic guns that might drop as loot\nDodging hunters is difficult to do for an airborne build.

If running from a Hunter, make sure to consider the wall penetration ability because only certain angles will allow a Hunter to shoot through the wall and hit Cogmind.

Watchers also have a unique [[Sensor Arrays|Sensor]] jamming effect while Cogmind is within a certain distance of them.\nWatchers are arguably the most troublesome non-combat bot class in the game. Their large visual range, large reporting range, and sensor jamming abilities cause a wide variety of problems for many different build types. The most effective tool against them are [[Transmission Jammers]] which will block their reporting ability. While a Watcher is jammed, it is possible to tell if bots are nearby. If there are no bots nearby, nothing will happen when the Watcher is in range. However, if there are bots nearby, there will be a constant game log message of [[GameText]][Watcher type] distress signal jammed.[[/GameText]]\nWatchers are quite difficult to kill, especially the W-44 Eye variant. Their naturally higher than usual avoidance and propensity for running away makes them hard to hit, and a Watcher that lives to run away is a Watcher that continues to summon more trouble from far away. For airborne builds, any melee weapons are reasonable choices to kill them, especially if positioning for a [[Sneak Attack]]. For grounded builds, many EM weapons can kill a Watcher in one or two hits, especially with the high amount of corruption gained.

See [[Scraptown#Possible right-side rooms|this page]] for additional details.\n\n[[Heading]][[Optimus]] Alignment[[/Heading]]\nAfter registering as a UFD member, there is an additional option to align 0bPrime for an additional hack, lore, and a lategame event in [[Protoforge]]. Aligning can be done by talking to Optimus in the HQ center area. This will add an additional + to the UFD name in the UI. Aligning will cause a civil war to break out if Cogmind hangs around the map too long, which can be used to grab some loot on the map. However, if Optimus dies in the war, Cogmind's UFD membership is revoked.\n\n[[Heading]]Unique Hacks[[/Heading]]\nSeveral new hacks become available with UFD alignment at [[Recycling Unit|Recycling Units]]:\n[[Heading:2]][[GameText]]Force(Fedlink)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]\nThis hack hooks up additional Recycling Units to the UFD network. This provides a few more resources to be used for [[Scrapoid]] and [[Scraphulk]] summoning. [[Redacted]]Added resources provide additional support to the UFD during the [[Protoforge]] assault.[[/Redacted]]\n[[Heading:3]]Resource Mechanics[[/Heading]]\nThe UFD resource count is a number that is indicated in the terminal after each UFD hack is performed. These resources go up automatically on each floor but are more substantially affected by performing Fedlink hacks. Each Fedlink provides +10 resources on the first hack of each depth, +4 resources on the second, and +2 on all subsequent hacks.\nThe initial resource count is 20 (plus an additional 4 upon entering -6) if Scraptown is located on -9 or -8. This number is bumped up to 35 (plus an additional 3 upon entering -5) if Scraptown is located on -7 to compensate for the extra skipped Factory floor.\nEach depth, the number of resources goes up by a small amount:\n[[Table]]\nDepth|Resources added|Cumulative free resources||\n-6|+4|4||\n-5|+3|7||\n-4|+3|10||\n-3|+3|13||\n-2|+2|15||\n-1|+2|17\n[[/Table]]\n[[Heading:4]]0bPrime Readiness[[/Heading]]\nThe numeric resource count is assigned a readiness value based on whether the civil war occurred in Scraptown:\n[[Table]]\nReadiness|Civil War Range|No Civil War Range||\nMinimal|0-79|0-39||\nVery Low|80-99|40-59||\nLow|100-119|60-79||\nAdequate|120+|80-99||\nHigh|N/A|100-119||\nMaximal|N/A|120+\n[[/Table]]\nFor full details of what the readiness values indicate, see [[Protoforge#ufd_reinforcements|Protoforge UFD Reinforcements]].\n[[Heading:4]]Example Numbers[[/Heading]]\nHere are example numbers of a run with Scraptown on -9/-8 with 2 fedlinks performed per depth:\n[[Table]]\nDepth|Initial Resources|Ending Resources||\n-6|24|38||\n-5|41|55||\n-4|58|72||\n-3|75|89||\n-2|91|103\n[[/Table]]\nIn order to hit the maximum readiness by -2, 9 additional Fedlinks need to be performed outside of those 2 Fedlinks per depth, assuming no hacks that consume resources are used. To achieve it by -3, that number goes up to 16 additional Fedlinks.\n[[Heading:2]][[GameText]]Force(Scraphulk)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]\nThis hack summons 1 blue controllable Scraphulk to the Recycling unit within a few turns of performing the hack.

Bots not listed in the below table don't count toward an active scanning penalty.\n[[Table]]\nBot type|Number of bots of this type scanned to be fully detected|Detection %||\n[[Alpha 7]]|4|30%||\n[[Armor Guard]]|4|30%||\n[[Behemoth]]|4|30%||\n[[Brawler]]|15|7%||\n[[Cetus Guard]]|4|30%||\n[[Combat Programmer]]|10|10%||\n[[Cutter]]|20|5%||\n[[Duelist]]|15|7%||\n[[E-15 Imp]]|20|5%||\n[[Executioner]]|10|10%||\n[[Fortress]]|4|30%||\n[[Grunt]]|15|7%||\n[[Heavy]]|7|15%||\n[[Hunter]]|10|10%||\n[[Programmer]]|7|15%||\n[[Q-Series]]|10|10%||\n[[Quarantine Guard]]|4|30%||\n[[S7 Guard]]|4|30%||\n[[Sentry]]|7|15%||\n[[Specialist]]|15|7%||\n[[Striker]]|10|10%||\n[[Swarmer]]|20|5%||\n[[Watcher]]|10|10%\n[[/Table]]"

Can't be reduced by [[Core Shieldings]] or [[Defensive Utilities]]. Only happens when Cogmind attacks something with the Companion Sword.|Uncommon||\nBot Disruption|A bot is instantly disrupted on a normal attack.

These Traps are most commonly found in [[Caves]] and [[Warlord (Location)]] and are friendly to Cogmind unless one was reprogrammed by a [[Minesweeper]] that was interrupted before it could extract it, or if [[Spoiler]]Cogmind antagonises Warlord (Location), which will cause all derelict traps on that map to also turn hostile.[[/Spoiler]]\n\n[[Heading]]How to obtain[[/Heading]]\nThere are three main ways of acquiring Dirty Bomb Traps for personal use:\n[[List]]Obtaining Derelict-made ones by extracting them using a [[Trap Extractors|Trap Extractor]] (since they are friendly, they don't need to be reprogrammed beforehand) or letting a Minesweeper extract them for you.\n|[[Spoiler]]Fabricating them using a [[Bomb Factory No. 2]].[[/Spoiler]]\n|[[Spoiler]]Obtaining the schematic through a [[Tech Extrapolator]] by seeing a [[Heavy Explosive Trap]], a [[Tesla Bomb Launcher]] and a [[Hvy.

When using multiple traps that way, it is usually better to place them around the squad's path in a sort of V-shape pointed in the direction the squad is going towards, so that one of the squad leader's followers moving on the side would trigger a Dirty Bomb Trap, causing all other traps to also explode while the majority of the squad is standing in the center of the Traps.\n\n[[/List]]"

It can be obtained by performing any of the actions that increase the ECA force multiplier listed below. After this, a Derelict will appear in the next [[Caves]] map and deliver the Array, give some more details on its usage, and reveal the depth of [[Warlord (Location)]]. The ECA cannot be used if Cogmind has been [[Imprint|Imprinted]] or made use of a [[RIF|RIF installer]], as these alignments are mutually exclusive with Warlord.\n\n[[Heading]]Summoning squads[[/Heading]]\nEquipping the ECA on any main 0b10 floor will reveal up to 8 squads available for summoning. Each time a squad is summoned, the force multiplier is decreased by 0.01. Moving over one of the squad indicators on the map will summon several white colored [[Alert]]-free allies that will follow Cogmind around the map, but will not follow to any other maps. These bots also do not gain trap location knowledge from Cogmind like purple or blue allies, so they may move over known traps. The squads do not get stronger as depth increases, so they have less utility in late [[Factory]] and [[Research]] depths. All squads have a chance of containing a [[Surgeon]] that will repair any allied bots as well as Cogmind. The available squads are:\n[[List]]Chimera Squad: [[Mutant|Mutants]]|Dakka Squad: [[Wasp|Wasps]]|Muscle Squad: [[Butcher|Butchers]] and [[Savage|Savages]]|Geek Squad: [[Wizard|Wizards]]|Ghost Squad: [[Infiltrator|Infiltrators]]|Infantry Squad: [[Thug|Thugs]]|Pyro Squad: [[Fireman|Firemen]]|Ranger Squad: [[Guerrilla|Guerrillas]][[/List]]\nIf Cogmind meets Warlord at his base, the squad summoning and force multiplier reporting mechanics stop functioning, and there is no point to hold onto the ECA any longer.\n\n[[Heading]]Force multiplier[[/Heading]]\nThe ECA brings an additional mechanic to Warlord alignment called the force multiplier. This value is reported every time Cogmind enters a new main 0b10 depth. The force multiplier affects several things:\n[[List]]The total number of squads available to summon per map. This starts at 0 squads at a 1.00 force multiplier and caps at 8 at 1.08.|Special guard squads in the -2 [[Research]] Warlord assault event. Based on the performance tier, more bots and stronger squads can be summoned to aid Cogmind during the assault.|-1 [[Access]] spillover forces: In Access, additional Warlord forces will appear at the entrance to the map. More squads will appear with a higher force multiplier.|[[Redacted]]The [[Command]] seals will summon more and stronger bots based on the overall force multiplier.[[/Redacted]][[/List]]\nThe force multiplier tiers are as follows:\n[[List]]D: 1.00 - 1.09|C: 1.10 - 1.19|B: 1.20 - 1.29|A: 1.30 - 1.39|S: 1.40+[[/List]]\nThe following are the ways that the force multiplier can be modified:\n[[Table]]\nMethod|Effect||\nSterilizing a DSF|+ 0.10||\nGarrison interior compromised (once per Garrison)|+ 0.02||\nDestroying a RIF installer|+ 0.02||\nDestroying a Garrison Relay|+ 0.01||\nDestroying a [[Phase Generator]]|+ 0.01||\nSummoning an ECA squad|- 0.01||\nAscending a depth|- 0.01\n[[/Table]]\n\n[[Heading]]Additional abilities[[/Heading]]\n[[Heading:2]][[Infiltrator]] Conversion[[/Heading]]\nThe ECA has a unique ability that interacts with [[Heavy]]-summoned [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcement Squads]]. Occasionally, [[Specialist|Specialists]] summoned by the Heavy will reveal themselves to be Infiltrators in disguise and turn friendly to Cogmind.\n[[Heading:2]]Friendly [[Ambush Trap]] detection[[/Heading]]\nThe Encrypted Comm Array will detect and reveal friendly ambush traps. When this happens, there will be a log message [[GameText]]Comm Array decrypts allied signals from nearby ambush traps.[[/GameText]]\n\n[[Heading]]Post-Warlord RIF[[/Heading]]\nIt is possible to install RIF after meeting Warlord. Warlord and his forces will not turn against Cogmind at this point, as they can only detect RIF inside of the Warlord base. However, doing so will lose some of the benefits. The -2 special guards will not appear based on the force multiplier. [[Redacted]]Additionally, fewer squads will be dispatched to follow Cogmind around from the Command seals. However, the seals will still have a higher number and more powerful bots based on the force multiplier as usual.[[/Redacted]]"

   "Content": "Microwarp Drives are attachable non-consumable two-slot utility [[Alien Artifacts]] that allow warping across any number of open spaces nearly instantly, at the cost of Cogmind's core integrity equal to 2 per space traveled. \"Open spaces\" means any tile Cogmind would be able to freely move onto, which includes tiles occupied only by items or doors[[Comment]]Does this include undiscovered hidden doors? If not, what if Cogmind has the Structural Interface RIF ability? What about phase walls?[[/Comment]]. A microwarp will only end upon reaching a non-open space. Microwarp Drives can be found exclusively in the western side of [[Section 7]] as unguarded Artifacts.\n\nNeither hostiles nor Cogmind are able to see any moment of a microwarp, meaning hostiles will not spot Cogmind if a microwarp passes through their FOV but ends outside of it. Cogmind will not be able to see anything while microwarping either, be it robots, items, or map structure, though the specific tiles Cogmind has traveled through will be added to the map as if they had been scanned[[Comment]]Does it only add \"empty\" tiles to map intel regardless of what type of tile was actually there, or does it add each tile's current state?[[/Comment]]. Microwarps always takes one full turn[[Comment]]I'm not sure if it's exactly 100 time units, but i would guess so?[[/Comment]], regardless of current regular propulsion speed or distance traveled.\n\n\n[[Heading]]Uses[[/Heading]]\n[[List]]\nFaster movement - When using slow propulsion such as [[Treads]], microwarps allow moving much faster than otherwise possible, making it easier or just feasible to close in on hostiles, strategically reposition, or flee. \n|Stealth - Since Cogmind cannot be spotted during microwarps, clever microwarping can make it possible to go past patrols and guards without getting spotted.\n|Digging - Since microwarps are near instantaneous, they be used to cross any number of dug-out/unstable tiles without any risks of [[Cave-ins|cave-ins]]. For example, this can be used to consistently get from one quadrant of a [[Garrison]] to another without having to go through the Garrison's center.\n|Super-cannon digging - By combining microwarps with a cannon capable of [[GameText]]x* Unlimited[[/GameText]] penetration capable of digging very far in one shot, such as a [[Core Cannon]] or a [[Hyp. Alpha Cannon]], it is possible to dig and travel really quickly through long tunnels, and even chain cannon shots and microwarps together repeatedly (at a risk of cave-ins) to quickly move large distances by going around the complex layout itself. For example, with a Core Cannon, this combo can be used to realistically reach [[Redacted]]the western side of [[Command]] without going through [[MAIN.C (Shell)|MAIN.C]]'s chamber[[/Redacted]].\n\n|Lower move count - Each microwarp counts as a single \"move\" action, regardless of how many tiles were traveled, which can be used to delay or even avoid the dispatch of [[Intercept Squad|Intercept Squads]].[[Comment]]Source: A Beta 11 run i did, where i didn't get any Intercept Squads in Access despite having been scanned by an S7 Researcher. I had traveled 629 spaces, but only done 572 move actions. 568 of those moves were treaded, and 5 were microwarps (yes i know it should add up to 573, don't ask me why it's counted this way).[[/Comment]]\n[[/List]]"

All bots that are tracking Cogmind will instantly lose tracking, even including some [[Perfect Tracking]] mechanics. However, unlike a standard teleport, the NEM can teleport Cogmind through solid walls. This can sometimes be useful for escaping squads as it will place Cogmind out of sight in a different room. One downside of this effect is that teleporting can repeatedly trigger the [[Watcher]] [[Alert]] increase on sight, as it will forget Cogmind each time the teleport occurs.\n[[Heading:2]]Frequency[[/Heading]]\nThere are 2 \"timers\" that can activate an NEM teleport. One is based on tiles moved, and the other is based on non-moving actions.\nThe non-moving actions timer will count up whenever Cogmind performs any action other than moving. This includes waiting in place, so it is not possible to avoid teleports altogether. The non-moving action timer will trigger every 36-48 actions.\nThe moving actions timer will count up for every move Cogmind makes. This timer is much shorter, and will occur 20-32 tiles moved.\n[[Heading:2]]Distance[[/Heading]]\nA single NEM teleport will move Cogmind anywhere between 8-12 tiles from the original location. If a [[Subatomic Replicator]] is used on the NEM and two are consumed, this effect doubles to 16-24 tiles moved."

If no slots are available, the weapon in the first slot will be detached to make room. Occurs even if the Quantum Companion is destroyed, in which case it will reappear with full integrity. The log message [[GameText]]Quantum Companion materializes via a weapon slot.[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens.|Always||\nSensors|After some time in Quantum Companion form, the Quantum Companion will develop 12 range bot detection. Unlike typical sensors, this works on all bots without a [[Signal Interpreter]], even if they have the Scan Cloak trait, and cannot be jammed in any way. However, inactive (dormant/disabled/broken/unpowered) bots will not be detected.|Always||\nSurprise Attack|The Quantum Companion will \"surprise attack\" one additional target on a normal attack. Can only happen if there is at least two hostiles are within melee range. The log message [[GameText]]Quantum Companion surprise attacks [target].[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens.|Common||\nCore Loss|The Companion Sword deals between 5-10 core damage directly to Cogmind's core on a normal attack. Can't be reduced by [[Core Shieldings]] or [[Defensive Utilities]]. Only happens when Cogmind attacks something with the Companion Sword.|Uncommon||\nShadow Attack|A shadow clone of the sword attacks a hostile bot at range. Can occur even when not attacking. This attack cannot miss. The log message [[GameText]]Quantum Companion releases a shadow of itself that zips off toward [target].[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens. This attack deals 70-100 phasic damage.[[Comment]]IMPORTANT QUESTION: can this effect occur while a Researcher can see it? If so, would it cause them to notice Cogmind?[[/Comment]]|Uncommon||\nBot Disruption|A bot is instantly disrupted on a normal attack. As with normal disruption, a disrupted bot can be rewired as long as it isn't hacking immune. The log message [[GameText]][target] shuts down.[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens.|Rare||\nRedirected Attack|When attacked by a projectile, the Quantum Companion will redirect the attack back to the attacker. The log message [[GameText]]Redirected attack with Quantum Companion.[[/GameText]] will appear with this happens.|Rare||\nSever|A part is severed off of a bot on a normal attack. This effect can hit through the Dismemberment immunity, unlike standard Sever critical hits.|Rare||\nSunder|This effect will instantly sunder a bot, similar to the [[Core Stripper]] on a normal attack. All parts are dropped between 1/3 and 2/3 integrity. Affected by the Dismemberment immunity. The log message [[GameText]][target] is sundered.[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens. 200 energy required for this effect.|Rare||\nSurge of Energy|This effect instantly kills a bot on a normal attack. The log message [[GameText]][target] is pierced by a surge of energy.[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens.|Rare||\n\nTeleport|Cogmind is instantly teleported to an empty space next to a visible [[Comment]]IMPORTANT QUESTION: How do the visibility requirements work, exactly? Can you be teleported because one of your drone sees a hostile? Can you be teleported due to having higher vision range due to having a Visual Processing Unit?[[/Comment]] hostile bot at no time cost, through machinery, other bots and even the target itself if necessary. Also sets momentum to maximum, and can be used to trigger an instant sneak attack if the bot hasn't spotted Cogmind yet. The teleport will prioritize closer hostiles, unless some hostiles can be sneak attacked and some cannot, in which case it will prioritize hostiles that can be sneak attacked.[[Comment]]I feel like this last sentence about target priority could be reworded to be clearer, and could also possibly explicitly mention that a teleport will ignore a hostile if there is no empty space next to it.[[/Comment]]\nCan happen at any point in time[[Comment]]Can it really? I did a flight run with this, and it always seemed to trigger at the start of my turn (I was never spotted due to this movement, even when it triggered during a wait action).[[/Comment]], and can still happen even if the Companion isn't currently attached, in which case the Materialization effect will be triggered simultaneously[[Comment]]I'm basing this information off of Kyzrati's \"swordy run part 2\" stream. Not sure if the materialization happens before or after the teleport, but probably before?[[/Comment]]. Be careful, as this effect can very easily send Cogmind into dangerous situations or hinder a tactical retreat. The log message [[GameText]]The surroundings shift and blur.[[/GameText]] will appear when this happens. 25 energy required for this effect.|Rare\n[[/Table]]\n\n[[Heading]]Transformation[[/Heading]]\nIf a Subatomic Replicator is used on the Quantum Companion, it will transform into the [[Superquantum Companion]]. Unlike the base Companion Sword, this effect does not occur from use alone. This means that it is not possible to use a replicator to get from the base Companion Sword and also get the Quantum Companion. When this happens, the following game log message will appear: [[GameText]]Quantum Companion blips out of existence for a moment, then partially fades back in.[[/GameText]] The Superquantum Companion will also comment on it, saying one of multiple possible [[Companion Sword#upgrading|upgrade lines]]."

   "Name": "Scrap Engine",
   "Content": "Scrap Engine is a unique [[Derelict]] part that can only be obtained by stealing from the [[Recycling#Scraplab|Scraplab in Recycling]]. It has the capability to create powerful constructs by combining many different parts into one. It can create power constructs of up to 4 slots, propulsion up to 8 slots, and weapons of up to 4 slots. When more of Cogmind's slots are dedicated to constructs, they will also get more powerful overall.\nThe Scrap Engine can be obtained in one of two ways, with various consequences. The first way is by simply taking it from the Scraplab in Recycling normally. This will cause all the bots in the lab to become hostile to Cogmind, as well as enraging [[Zion]] and [[Warlord (Location)]]. However, if Cogmind visits the [[Subcaves]] beforehand, exits to [[Materials]], and then goes to Recycling, the map will be attacked by [[Subdweller|Subdwellers]]. In the chaos, the Scraplab will have been abandoned, and Cogmind can take the part without causing hostilities.\nThe Scrap Engine can create combinations of parts that would never be seen normally, such as energy cannons dealing kinetic damage with heat transfer, or 50 speed treads. Modifications to the constructs will only change a few stats at a time, so overall variability is extremely high when using the engine. Modifying a construct with a flight unit may result in a much higher speed, or it may dramatically reduce the integrity and support instead. Every part that is eaten can be a gamble, since the stats that are modified are random every time.\n\n[[Heading]]Processing Parts/Inventory[[/Heading]]\nThe Scrap Engine can be fed parts by enabling it and standing on top of a part. Once eaten, a part will remain in the Scrap Engine's inventory until it is used for creating a new construct or for modifying an existing one. Up to 10 power, propulsion, protection, and weapons can be stored (counted separately for each part type). This inventory can be used as a pseudo-storage mechanism by preemptively eating a part and disabling the Scrap Engine to prevent use until later. This is more efficient than keeping parts in regular inventory, but is more restrictive since the parts used for modification can't be explicitly selected anymore. If over 10 parts of a given type is fed to the engine, the first part in the engine's inventory will be destroyed.\n[[Heading:2]]Broken/Faulty parts[[/Heading]]\nThe output of the Scrap Engine is not negatively affected by inputting low-integrity, broken, or faulty parts. As such, it may be a good idea to feed these parts to the Scrap Engine instead of throwing them away or letting them become totally destroyed.\n[[Heading:2]]Protection parts[[/Heading]]\nRather than going toward creating new constructs, protection is instead used to reinforce the Scrap Engine itself. The first time that a protection item is consumed, the Scrap Engine will turn itself into the [[Arm. Scrap Engine]], gaining more coverage and integrity. Every subsequent armor piece consumed will restore 100 Scrap Engine integrity.\n\n[[Heading]]Creating constructs[[/Heading]]\nIf 2 power, 3 propulsion, or 4 weapons are stored in the engine's inventory at once, a new construct can be created by combining all of the parts into a new one. Duplicates of a part may be used in new constructions, but at least 2 unique parts must be involved in new construct creation. Note: There is a maximum of 1 power and 1 propulsion construct each at a time, but up to 4 weapon constructs can be created. New constructs are created with a mix of the stats of the original items put into them. The Scrap Engine will preferentially create new constructs as opposed to modifying existing ones.\n[[Heading:2]]Naming[[/Heading]]\nThe names of constructs are generated from a combination of parts processed up to that point. For example, eating an [[Ion Engine]] and a [[Nuclear Core]] may result in a Nuclear-Ion Core. Further modifications may cause the name to change over time.\n[[Heading:2]]Type[[/Heading]]\nThe initial type of a construct will be selected randomly from its original parts. This can cause unusual stats, such as treads much faster than typically seen when created in combination with a faster propulsion type like flight. Like names, the type of a construct can change over time with more modifications. Propulsion constructs gain all natural ability of the propulsion type, like a flight construct granting bot hopping, or a leg construct granting running avoidance bonuses.\n\n[[Heading]]Modification[[/Heading]]\nConstructs can be modified when at least 2 different parts are stored in the Scrap Engine's inventory at a given time. For example, 2 [[Aluminum Leg|Aluminum Legs]] would not result in modification, but 1 Aluminum Leg and 1 [[Imp. Aluminum Leg]] would cause a modification, as would 1 Aluminum Leg and 1 [[Flight Unit]].\nEach time a construct is modified, 1-5 random stats (generally higher numbers for weapons, lower numbers for power and propulsion) are modified based on the parts that were just processed. Additionally, if there is a slot available, the modified construct may grow in size. The growing chance decreases as the construct gets bigger, so increasing from 1 slot to 2 slots is much easier than increasing from 2 to 3. Additionally, modifying a construct will restore about 1/3 of its integrity.\n[[Heading:2]]Multiple slots[[/Heading]]\nWhen parts evolve into multiple slots, some of the stats also scale proportionally. Resource costs always scale in accordance with the number of slots, as will integrity and coverage. Aside from that, primary aspects of the slot type like energy generation, support, and damage will all scale based on slot number. Stats that are percentage based, like overload burnout and critical hit chance, don't tend to change based on slot counts.\nOne unique interaction between multiple weapon constructs is the ability to merge. Rather than growing into a unique 2 slot weapon construct, sometimes 2 existing constructs will combine into a single multislot construct. The stats of both component constructs will be mixed together into the resultant construct.\n[[Heading:2]]Special Abilities[[/Heading]]\nNon-standard/special stats/abilities may be given to the constructs based on the type of part eaten. For example, eating a Cld. power source such as a [[Cld. Ion Engine]] may grant the ability to overload the power construct. These special stats/abilities may also be removed at random by further modifications. If a construct has a stat specific to a part type, such as overload on a flight/propulsion type, and changes to a new type that no longer supports it, such as treads, that special stat will be removed.\n[[Heading:3]]List of special stats/abilities applicable to constructs[[/Heading]]\n[[Table]]\nSlot|Stat/ability|Part to consume|Loss on type change?||\nPower|Overload|Any Cld. power source like [[Cld. Ion Engine]]|Never||\nPropulsion|Overload|Any Cld. flight or hover unit like [[Surge Thruster]]|Change to Wheel, Leg, or Treads||\nPropulsion|Siege Mode|Any 2 slot treads like [[Hvy. Siege Treads]]|Change to non-Treads||\nWeapon|Overload|Any Cld. energy weapon like [[Cld. Particle Cannon]]|Change to non-Energy Cannon/Gun||\nWeapon|Waypoints|Any guided weapon like [[Gui. Plasma Cannon]]|Never||\nWeapon|[[Spoiler]]Entropic damage type, additionally loss of integrity per shot[[/Spoiler]]|[[Spoiler]]Any Vortex weapon like [[Vortex Rifle]][[/Spoiler]]|Never\n[[/Table]]\n\n[[Heading]]Part destruction[[/Heading]]\nUnlike most parts, constructs are not always instantly destroyed when they run out of integrity. Any multislot parts are instead reduced in slot count and partially restored in integrity. Though the slot may be hard to regrow again, it does make constructs more resilient than they first might appear. The only exception to this rule is that a Vortex weapon construct will be entirely destroyed if it runs out of integrity due to being fired.\nWhen any construct is forced to shrink in size via damage, fully destroyed, or manually removed, the Scrap Engine will be slightly damaged in the process, reporting that [[GameText]]Scrap Engine damaged due to network destabilization[[/GameText]].\n\n[[Heading]]General Strategies[[/Heading]]\nScrap Engine tends to be a very powerful but often unreliable part. It can generate abnormally powerful constructs, far outstripping anything else available, and then snatch the positive aspects of them away and leave you with a weapon that generates 400 heat per shot. As such, making modifications with a lot of spare parts around is always a good idea to reduce the chance of getting stuck with a hard to use part. On the other hand, if a great construct is created, it may often be worth postponing further modifications until needed to repair integrity. Otherwise, the best qualities may be lost before long.\nA good strategy is to approach the modifications with moderation. Going all in on thermal energy cannons may result in a high damaging high meltdown weapon, but may also spike your own heat generation past reasonable levels. Mixing in lower heat generating kinetic guns and cannons will tend to balance your weapons out with more sustainable energy and heat resource costs. Propulsion can be approached similarly. Eating a mixture of hover, legs, and tread propulsion will tend toward middle of the road constructs that aren't amazing at anything in particular, but you will rarely end up with the excessive highs and lows that can occur if only one type of propulsion is focused on. Additionally, being more lenient in what you eat will help keep constructs topped off on integrity.\nFor a higher risk higher reward approach, mixing extremes like treads and flight can result in some incredibly overpowered propulsion constructs. A primarily treads-orientated propulsion construct only needs a single good flight modification to take the speed down to close to the 40 speed range. However, bad modification can instead lose lots of integrity or support. Doing this is safer with a lot of spare parts to eat in case things go south. Another example of a beneficial extreme is combining high critical rate Hyp. weapons like [[Hyp. Gauss Cannon]] with meltdown criticals from thermal cannons. It is possible to create an abnormally high meltdown critical % weapon this way, at the risk of losing some weapon damage.\n[[Heading:2]]Multi-projectile Weapons[[/Heading]]\n[[Flak Gun|Flak Guns]] can produce excellent constructs due to their high projectile count. While some stats get reduced to compensate for the increased projectile count, it is still possible to achieve overall high damage and a high critical percent chance. It is even possible to go beyond the original weapon's projectile count (6 in the case of Flak Guns). Heat transfer is another good stat to apply to a large projectile construct. A high heat transfer combined with a high projectile count can melt bots nearly instantly.\n[[Heading:2]]Miscellaneous Tips[[/Heading]]\n[[List]]Have a stockpile of parts before equipping the Scrap Engine - Recycling is a good place to get a strong start on constructs due to the large number of different types of parts to eat, and the lack of big threats. If saving Scrap Engine for later, try to create a good sized loot pile ahead of time to get a head start on growing the constructs.|\nDon't go all in on EM damage - If all of your weapon slots are a single construct of EM type damage and you run into a [[Programmer]], you're going to have a rough time.|\nBe careful of destroying cover - Construct weapons tends to be much more powerful than typical weapons and will blow through walls right and left. This is good in some situations, but it can also leave you wide open to multiple angles of attack.|\nLeave a slot open for a [[Launchers]] - Dedicating all of your weapon slots to constructs makes it hard to deal with [[Swarmer|\nSwarmers]] or other large groups of hostiles.|\nMake careful [[Storage Unit|\nStorage]] selections - Larger storage units like [[Hcp. Storage Unit]] and above may be difficult to carry if flight and hover propulsion are eaten. Smaller storage units can be carried more easily without overweight penalties with a bad support modifications.|\nModify constructs with slots open - If trying to grow a construct, make sure that an empty slot is available for growth. This is especially the case for weapon constructs. Even though two weapon constructs may occasionally merge into a single multislot construct, it is more reliable to grow the slot number by keeping one available.|\nDon't have more than 3 weapons in engine inventory at a time - If trying to grow a weapon construct in number of slots, having 4 parts in inventory with an open weapon slot will always result in a new construct being created rather than having the existing construct modified. It may take a little longer, but making sure to process only 2 at a time will ensure maximum modifications and the highest chance to grow a weapon construct in slot count.|\nTake Alignments - [[Warlord (Alignment)]] and [[Imprint]] can both be the source of great parts to feed the scrap engine. Note that in order to align, Cogmind must have taken the Scrap Engine from a Subdweller-attacked Recycling, otherwise the associated maps will be hostile.[[/List]]"

   "Name": "Seismic Detector",
   "Content": "The Seismic Detector is an unusual piece of [[Infowar]] that can detect nearby seismic activity with a radius of 22. In-game, this is represented by flashing orange to yellow colors. More intense activity is indicated by a bright yellow color, while less intense activity fades down to a dark orange. There are several major components of seismic activity that can be detected with this part:\n[[List]]\nRobot movement detection: Bots that move on [[Wheels]], [[Legs]], or [[Treads]] will cause varying amounts of seismic activity. Wheel movement is indicated by dark orange color and is typically only 1-2 tiles long. Leg movement is indicated by a bright orange color and can typically be 2-4 tiles long. Tread movement is indicated by a bright yellow color and is typically 3-4 tiles long. Bots that are [[Hover Unit|hovering]], [[Flight Unit|flying]], or not moving do not create any seismic activity.|\nActive machine detection: Certain machines create seismic activity. Note that [[Interactive Machine|Interactive Machines]] such as [[Terminal|Terminals]] do not create any seismic activity, but many non-interactive machines do, especially in [[Factory]].\n[[Comment]]TODO: Could make a full list of machines that can be detected.[[/Comment]]|\nExplosion detection: Explosions create very large areas of intense bright yellow seismic activity.[[/List]]\n[[Image]]Seismic Detector Activating.webp|The Seismic Detector being activated[[/Image]]\n\n[[Heading]]Analysis[[/Heading]]\nSeismic Detector can be used both as a primary yet somewhat limited source of infowar or with a combination of other infowar parts effectively.\n[[Heading:2]]Pros/Cons[[/Heading]]\n[[List]](+) Swappable single slot: Other sources of infowar such as [[Sensor Arrays]] and [[Terrain Scanners]] can take 2 slots to use to maximum effectiveness, while the Seismic Detector only requires 1 slot and can be easily swapped during combat.|\n(+) Long range: 22 range is one of the largest ranges of infowar in the game for bot detection in the game and is 6 tiles longer than the default sight range.|\n(+) Machine detection (sometimes): While inconsistent at best, the Seismic Detector can occasionally give a rough idea of the size and position of rooms due to seismic activity-generating machines inside of them.|\n(+) Non-jammability: Unlike Sensor Arrays, Seismic Detectors can't be jammed by [[Watcher|Watchers]] or [[Heavy|Heavies]] and is also immune to the map-wide scrambling effect of the Phase Generator in [[Garrison|Garrisons]] and [[Command]].|\n(+) Detection of [[Investigation Squad|Investigation]] and [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcement Squads]]: Since these squads typically contain all grounded bots like [[Grunt|Grunts]] and [[Hunter|Hunters]], these squads can be detected and avoided from far away.|\n(-) Difficulty to decipher: It takes some time to learn how to interpret seismic readings. It is also hard to keep track of all the movement going on in busy areas. ARCs can often blend in with non-combat wheeled bots.|\n(-) Inability to detect hovering/flying bots: While the Seismic Detector can point out squads of grounded bots including [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]] in [[Patrol Squad|Patrol Squads]], it will fail to detect other common [[Programmer]] or [[Swarmer]] patrol squads. Other problematic bots that will fail to be detected are Watchers and [[Operator|Operators]].|(-) Inability to detect guards: [[Sentry|Sentries]], [[Behemoth|Behemoths]], and other types of [[Security Squad|Security Squads]] are all immobile under normal circumstances and cannot be detected.[[/List]]\n[[Heading:2]]General Strategy/Usage[[/Heading]]\nIf being used as the main source of bot detection, Cogmind should be prepared to deal with bots that the Seismic Detector can't detect. Swarmers, Programmers, Sentries, and Behemoths are the primary combat bots that fall under this category. While most of these bots are fairly common to encounter anyway, lack of Behemoth detection is a major shortcoming. Combat builds are typically more suited than stealth builds to handle its limitations as a solo infowar part. While the bot detection is quite powerful, absolute stealth is not an option. For flight especially, running into Programmers and Swarmers unexpectedly can often lead to dangerous situations.\nThe Seismic Detector is very good at helping Cogmind avoid Investigations and Reinforcements. [[Spoiler]]The downside of Force hacks summoning an Investigation squad is less of a downside if the Investigation can be avoided. [[UFD]] alignment often wants to perform a lot of Force hacks, so Seismic Detector makes a good combo.[[/Spoiler]]\n[[Heading:3]]Good Part Combos[[/Heading]]\nSome other infowar utilities have traits that synergize well with the Seismic Detector.\n[[Heading:4]]Sensor Arrays[[/Heading]]\nWhile it may seem redundant, Seismic Detector can be paired effectively with Sensor Arrays, both with or without [[Signal Interpreters]]. In both cases, Seismic Detector boasts a superior range and an inability to be jammed or scrambled.\nSeismic Detector and interpreter-less sensors can cover large weaknesses of each other. Normally, an interpreter with a high enough rating is required to detect Hunters. However, if a bot shows up with seismic activity but not on the sensor, it is either within a Heavy's jamming range or a Hunter. Conversely, bots that show up on sensors but not the Seismic Detector are either hovering or flying or are stationary. All bots are detectable with this combination of 2 parts, and both utilities both be swapped off during combat. One downside of this combo is that the class of bots is never known for certain and must be guessed based on behavior.\nFor sensors with an interpreter, there is still one advantage of Seismic Detector that is worth mention. [[H-88 Terminator|H-88 Terminators]] are a particular scary bot to fight and are found in large numbers in -2 and -1. They require an [[Exp. Signal Interpreter]] to be seen on sensors, which is a rare part to find on the ground. The Seismic Detector will detect these Hunters as long as they are moving.\n[[Heading:4]]Terrain Scanners[[/Heading]]\nOne of the biggest weaknesses of the Seismic Scanner is the inability to detect Sentries and Behemoths. Since their positions are fixed and often buried in a nook within walls, good terrain scanning can locate these bots even when the Seismic Detector cannot. This requires a decently rated [[Terrain Scan Processors|Terrain Scan Processor]] as the base scanning speed is too low to consistently locate these spots.\n[[Heading:4]][[Transmission Jammers]][[/Heading]]\nWhile Transmission Jammers are universally useful, being able to jam Watchers is particularly useful since many bot types may not always be detected ahead of time, avoiding scenarios where a Watcher alerts a yet unnoticed Behemoth or nearby squad.\n[[Heading:4]][[Cloaking Device|Cloaking Devices]]/[[Visual Processing Units]][[/Heading]]\nBoth of these parts serve a similar effect in terms of Seismic Detector synergy. Having a sight advantage can allow Cogmind to visually spot bots that the Seismic Detector wouldn't pick up. The bots can then either be fought or avoided after their location has been identified.\n\n[[Heading]]Examples of seismic activity[[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Seismic Detector Prop Types.gif|Different propulsion types.

Initially it is found on an unpowered [[Sigix Warrior]] named Sigix Exoskeleton in the bottom right corner of the hangar. If Cogmind has used a [[Core Reset Matrix]] (CRM), it is possible to enter the Exoskeleton, which dramatically alters gameplay for the rest of the current run.\n\n[[Heading]]Unique effects[[/Heading]]\n[[Heading:3]]Additional Core Damage[[/Heading]]\nRoughly 1/3 of all damage dealt to the Sigix Exoskeleton is also dealt to Cogmind's core.\n[[Heading:3]]Alien Weapon Damage Boost[[/Heading]]\nAll non-AOE attacks from Sigix weapons is doubled. However, this effect does not stack with things like [[Particle Chargers]]. The full list of affected weapons is as follows: [[Core Cannon]], [[Core Stripper]], [[Modified Sigix Sheargun]], [[Sigix Broadsword]], [[Sigix Shearcannon]], and [[Sigix Sheargun]]\n[[Heading:3]][[Assembled]] Absorption[[/Heading]]\nWhile the Exoskeleton is damaged, Assembled can be absorbed to repair it by 30 integrity when standing next to Cogmind.\n[[Heading:3]]Core Dependence[[/Heading]]\nCogmind's core becomes dependent on the Exoskeleton. Even if Cogmind still has remaining core, if the Exoskeleton is destroyed the game will instantly be loss.\n[[Heading:3]]Enhanced Hypermatrix Pings[[/Heading]]\nWhenever entering a new floor with Assembled spawns available (all main 0b10-controlled floors, [[DSF|DSFs]], and [[Command]]), 6-8 Assembled will appear near Cogmind. Additionally, the Exoskeleton provides the CRM's hypermatrix ping detection and Assembled summoning ability at all times rather than only while at 1/3 core.\n[[Heading:3]]Damage Reduction[[/Heading]]\nThe Exoskeleton provides a 50% damage resistance to all conventional damage types. This effect stacks with most [[Defensive Utilities]], but not with [[Resistance Devices]].\n[[Heading:3]]Deactivation-Proof[[/Heading]]\nThe Exoskeleton cannot be deactivated by any means.

Most typical forms of armor are entirely unhelpful with the Exoskeleton equipped.\n[[Heading:3]][[Maximum Security]] Triggering[[/Heading]]\nAs soon as Cogmind is spotted by any combat hostile in most [[0b10]]-controlled maps, Maximum Security will be immediately engaged. One notable exception is that Maximum Security will not be triggered in Command.

However, Cogmind gets some boosts in exchange for the slots. Cogmind gains 100 fixed energy capacity, and every slot above the new 9 total slot count provides 3 innate energy generation and 5 heat dissipation. Not counting [[Core Expander|Core Expanders]], a typical -3 Section 7 provides 36 energy and 60 dissipation while a -2 Section 7 provides 42 energy and 70 dissipation. Slots can be evolved as normal after entering the Exoskeleton, including using Core Expanders. As a side-note, a [[Core Physics Calibrator]] cannot remove the 3 propulsion slots and force removal of the Exoskeleton.\n[[Heading:3]]UI Intel[[/Heading]]\nThere are 4 new pieces of intel located at the bottom of the inventory UI:\n[[List]]Threats: Counts the number of active hostiles within sensor radius.|Components: Counts the number of parts on the floor within sensor radius.|Ping number: Counts the number of active but untriggered Assembled hypermatrix pings.|Tor distance: Lists the distance to the Tor, the Sigix spaceship.

They can be found exclusively in the western side of [[Section 7]] as unguarded Artifacts.\n\nNote that the core integrity cost is for every space traveled during a spacefold, and not for every solid object, meaning that the tile that Cogmind ends up on also counts. For example, a spacefold through 2 walls would cost 3% core integrity, 2% for the wall and 1% for the tile Cogmind ends up on.\n\n[[Heading]]Uses[[/Heading]]\nThere are many Alien Artifacts or even regular items that can replace some of the Spacefold Activator's uses or at least allow for the same overall results, without the high core integrity cost. However, a Spacefold Activator is capable of a more versatile range of movements than any single one of those items, while also being precise, consistent and only taking up one slot.\n\n[[List]]Spacefolds can be used to bypass Reinforced Barriers, Sealed Heavy Doors and other difficult-to-destroy obstacles, without causing any [[Alert]] gain or requiring hacking. Since none of those obstacles are ever larger than 3 tiles, the only cases where spacefolds fail is when those obstacles contain a solid object within, such as allied [[Derelict|Derelicts]] imprisoned within small cells in [[Garrison|Garrisons]]. As with some other travel methods, going past Sealed Heavy Doors and the like may cause 0b10 to eventually open them to allow combat robots to chase down Cogmind, especially if there is no other way through, which can make it possible for allies to go through as well.|\n\nSpacefolds can be used to quickly get out of rooms or corridors when patrols or other dangers are approaching and into safer or more strategic locations, without creating any additional paths for those dangers to reach said locations. This is much faster than digging through walls, especially if there are multiple layers of solid objects in the way, and won't destroy any [[Interactive Machine|interactive machines]] that might have been in the way.|\n\nSpacefolds can allow for longer-range safe [[Digging|digs]]. While a [[Microwarp Drive]] allows for an even longer safe digging range and a lower core integrity loss, Spacefold Activators only take up one slot and cannot cause Cogmind to go farther than expected. [[Comment]]I don't know how spacefolding affects cave-ins, but if the only thing that matters is dug-out tiles traversed and \"not-dug-out-but-diggable\" spaces don't matter, then it should be possible to do stuff like an eight-tile dig, by digging five tiles to create a \"waypoint\", then digging once to the side to create a spot where you can spacefold to the waypoint, making the full movement = Dug-out-tile -> 3-tile spacefold -> \"waypoint\" -> 3-tile spacefold -> destination.[[/Comment]]\n\n[[/List]]"

Reprogrammed traps will no longer recognize Cogmind or allies as a threat, instead reacting to local combat robots. As part of the new programming, each trap's sensitivity will also be set dangerously high, ensuring it will trigger whenever a hostile moves over it, regardless of propulsion.\n\n\n[[Heading]]Collection[[/Heading]]\nAn enterprising Cogmind can, with the use of a [[Trap Extractors|Trap Extractor]], extract and store or pick up friendly traps for their own use. However, Chute Traps, [[Alarm Trap|Alarm Traps]] and [[Ambush Trap|Ambush Traps]] cannot be extracted to begin with. Stasis Traps also exhibit special behavior; they can be extracted but cannot be stored inside a Trap Extractor, and they can still be extracted even after they were triggered, as long as the stasis field they produce hasn't been depleted.\n\nLast edited during Beta 14."

   "Content": "Infowar (information warfare) is a general category of parts that revolve around gaining additional information about the surrounding map or its inhabitants and/or reducing the capabilities of hostile robots. Wandering around completely blind is possible, but can cause a lot of bad encounters and is generally very [[Community Challenges#No Info Only War|Challenging]]. Infowar can be used to do things like locate and avoid hostiles, search for specific elements of a map such as [[Interactive Machine|Interactive Machines]] or [[Exit|Exits]], and to generally navigate through a map more efficiently. Infowar is composed of primarily [[Utilities|Utility]] slot parts, although a few [[Alignment]]-related abilities can grant infowar-type effects without dedicating an active slot to them. The largest categories of infowar are bot detection and map detection.\nInfowar is useful on all build types, from combat to stealth alike. Stealth builds tend to have many slots of infowar active at once in order to completely avoid all contact with hostile bots. Combat builds, especially on slower propulsion types like [[Treads]], have difficulty avoiding encounters altogether, even with a large amount of infowar. However, infowar can help make informed decisions about combat encounters and help Cogmind take fights in beneficial scenarios. For example, one good use is preparing an [[Explosive Launchers|Explosive Launcher]] if a [[Swarmer]] squad is known to be nearby. Blindly wandering around into that same Swarmer squad might see Cogmind in a bad position, forced to take damage while spend turns swapping out a launcher or becoming surrounded.\nMany infowar utilities tend to be low integrity devices and should ideally be swapped into inventory before entering combat. High coverage [[Armor]] can help protect these parts, but even then, these parts tend to get destroyed fairly easily in combat. [[Utility Shieldings]] may reduce the need for swapping in combat, especially for a faster-moving flight or hover build that doesn't want to stick around for prolonged combat.\n\n[[Heading]]Infowar Types[[/Heading]]\n[[Heading:2]]Robot Detection[[/Heading]]\nThis type of infowar revolves around detecting bots before they are seen through normal [[Line of Sight]] mechanics. Being able to detect bots through walls, especially at a large distance, can be a large boon for avoiding unnecessary combat encounters.\n[[Heading:3]][[Sensor Arrays]][[/Heading]]\nSensor Arrays are the most basic and one of the most common forms of robot detection. Lower rating sensors have a low detection radius, equal or smaller than the primary 16 tile line of sight distance, so their primary use is finding bots in nearby rooms or around corners rather than long-ranged detection. Sensors are best paired with [[Signal Interpreters]] due to their ability to distinguish between different classes of bots. They can easily be looted from [[TF Node|TF Nodes]].\nThe [[Active Sensor Suite]] is a variant of the standard Sensor Array. It combines both the sensor and signal interpreting capabilities into a single part. It also provides a unique type of intel that shows commonly traveled robot paths to points of interest on the map.\n[[Heading:3]][[FarCom]][[/Heading]]\nFarCom is not a part, but is a free source of 18 tile radius robot detection that can be acquired by using the FarCom Aligner machine in the [[Exiles (Location)]]. Unlike most other types of robot detection, FarCom can detect only combat bots and only in [[0b10]] controlled maps. While [[Mines]] is counted as an 0b10-controlled map, [[Caves]] is notably not.\n[[Heading:3]][[Seismic Detector]] (bot detection)[[/Heading]]\nThe Seismic Detector is an indirect and somewhat unreliable source of robot detection. Grounded bots that move generate varying amounts of seismic activity that can be detected. Wheeled, legged, and treading bots create dark orange short, bright orange medium, and bright yellow long trails. Airborne bots cannot be detected by Seismic Detectors. They can often be looted off of [[T-07 Excavator|T-07 Excavators]].\n[[Heading:3]][[IFF Parsers]][[/Heading]]\nIFF Parsers are a basic form of robot detection. All bots are revealed by this part, although the type of bot is not revealed. Instead, the IFF parser reveals the faction of the scanned bot. 0b10-aligned bots show up in yellow while other bots show up in blue.\n[[Spoiler]]\n[[Heading:3]][[Quantum Companion]][[/Heading]]\nThe Quantum Companion is a unique weapon with many different effects. Some effects are not present on the [[Companion Sword|base form of the sword]], but only appear in the evolved Quantum form. One of these effects is a 12 tile radius sensor effect. While the range is very low, this part is unique in that it provides infowar in a weapon slot rather than in utility slots.\n[[/Spoiler]]\n[[Redacted]]\n[[Heading:3]][[Sigix Exoskeleton]] (Robot Detection)[[/Heading]]\nThe Sigix Exoskeleton is a unique propulsion item. It has a large number of effects, one of which is an 18-tile range robot detection effect. All active bots within the range are instantly detected. This part is unique in that it provides infowar in propulsion slots rather than in utility slots.[[/Redacted]]\n[[Heading:3]]Robot Detection and Patrol Navigation ([[RIF]] abilities)[[/Heading]]\nRobot Detection and Patrol Navigation are abilities that can randomly be gained when using a RIF installer. Robot Detection grants the detection of any 0b10-aligned combat bot within a 24 tile range when a matching [[Relay Couplers|Relay Coupler]] is attached. Patrol Navigation grants the prediction of squad movement paths within a 24 tile range when a matching Relay Coupler is attached, although it only reveals the path of the squad leader. While these abilities can detect bots with the Scan Cloak trait, they will not work in non-0b10 controlled maps like Caves. They tend to be fairly unreliable due to the many different types of bots that are present in 0b10. Having a coupler for every possible bot type takes an unreasonable amount of slots.\n[[Heading:3]][[0b10 Decoder Chip [Skirmisher]]][[/Heading]]\nThe Skirmisher, and to a lesser extent, the [[0b10 Decoder Chip [Generic]|Generic]] decoder chips, are two unique sources of bot detection. They do not directly reveal the class or location of specific bots like most bot detection sources. Instead, they can occasionally pick up the type and locations of patrol, investigation, reinforcement, and security squads and mark them as intel on the map. This effect only occurs in 0b10 controlled maps. This effect is somewhat unreliable due to the infrequent intel updates.\n[[Heading:3]][[Triangulator]][[/Heading]]\nThe Triangulator is an extremely niche 24 tile robot detecting utility with one major catch: It can only detect robots that are currently tracking Cogmind. This makes it unhelpful for avoiding hostile bots in the first place. However, once spotted, it can be a helpful tool to shake pursuers on faster propulsion types. This makes it unlike all of the other forms of bot detection since they are proactive instead of reactive. The Triangulator also has other effects including hostile visual range detection and travel paths, but they effects don't actively help in detecting bots. It has no restrictions on bot detection and can even detect bots with the Scan Cloak trait.\n[[Heading:3]]Robot Detection Infowar Comparison[[/Heading]]\n[[Table]]\nCategory|Sensor Arrays|Active Sensor Suite|FarCom|Seismic Detector|IFF Parsers|[[Spoiler]]Quantum Companion[[/Spoiler]]|[[Redacted]]Sigix Exoskeleton[[/Redacted]]|Robot Detection/Patrol Navigation|0b10 Decoder Chip [Skirmisher/Generic]|Triangulator||\nRange|[[CellStyle:Neutral]]14-20|[[CellStyle:Good]]20|[[CellStyle:Good]]18|[[CellStyle:Good]]22|[[CellStyle:Neutral]]16-26|[[CellStyle:Bad]]12|[[CellStyle:Good]]18|[[CellStyle:Good]]24|[[CellStyle:Good]]22|[[CellStyle:Good]]24||\nDetect Bot Class|[[CellStyle:Neutral]]With Signal Interpreter|[[CellStyle:Good]]Yes|[[CellStyle:Good]]Yes|[[CellStyle:Bad]]No|[[CellStyle:Bad]]No|[[CellStyle:Good]]Yes|[[CellStyle:Good]]Yes|[[CellStyle:Good]]Yes|[[CellStyle:Bad]]No|[[CellStyle:Good]]Yes||\nIgnores jamming/scrambling|[[CellStyle:Bad]]No|[[CellStyle:Good]]Yes|[[CellStyle:Good]]Yes|[[CellStyle:Good]]Yes|[[CellStyle:Bad]]No|[[CellStyle:Good]]Yes|[[CellStyle:Good]]Yes|[[CellStyle:Good]]Yes|[[CellStyle:Good]]Yes|[[CellStyle:Good]]Yes||\nBot detection limitations|[[CellStyle:Good]]Affected by Scan Cloak, requires [[Exp.

Terrain scanning can make traversal through a map more efficient and easier. When combined with robot detection, hostile squads can often be bypassed entirely with a safe path out of sight.\n[[Heading:3]][[Terrain Scanners]][[/Heading]]\nTerrain scanners are the basic form of terrain scanning that reveal a random selection of nearby tiles nearby. The basic rate of terrain scanning is very low and only reveals up to a few tiles per turn. They can be combined with [[Terrain Scan Processors]] to dramatically increase the amount of tiles that are scanned per turn. Slower propulsion types tend to get more value out of terrain scanners as it provides more time for the scanners to do their work. A powerful enough processor can make terrain scanning fast enough to work well for even fast flight builds.\n[[Heading:3]][[Structural Scanner]][[/Heading]]\nStructural Scanners are a form of short ranged terrain scanning that operate instantly. When a wall is seen in visual range, immediately surrounding tiles are instantly revealed, including emergency access doors. [[Spoiler]]For the [[Deep Structural Scanner]], 3 tiles deep are revealed instead.[[/Spoiler]] Due to its cheap upkeep and instant scanning speed, it is a high value for faster builds. It is particularly helpful at locating short digs and emergency accesses between adjacent rooms.\n[[Redacted]][[Heading:3]]Sigix Exoskeleton (Terrain Scanning)[[/Heading]]\nThe Sigix Exoskeleton is a unique propulsion item. It has a large number of effects, one of which is an 18-tile range terrain scanning effect. All types of terrain within that range, including hidden doors, are instantly detected.[[/Redacted]]\n[[Heading:3]][[Machine Analyzer]][[/Heading]]\nThe Machine Analyzer is an indirect source of terrain scanning. It does not reveal random terrain tiles, but it does reveal most types of machines. Once any interactive or non-interactive machine is spotted, nearby machines are also revealed. If an interactive machine was spotted, the nearest machine of the same type is also revealed regardless of distance.\n[[Heading:3]]Seismic Detector (terrain scanning)[[/Heading]]\nThe Seismic Detector is an indirect and unreliable source of terrain scanning. Certain machines will generate seismic activity that are picked up by this part. This only happens for a few types of non-interactive machines, and mostly in Factory maps. Interactive machines are never detected. This does not reveal any specific information about the terrain, but approximate room sizes and locations may be guessed based on the detected machines.\n[[Heading:3]][[0b10 Decoder Chip [Scout]]][[/Heading]]\nThe Scout, and to a lesser extent, the Generic decoder chips, are two sources of indirect terrain scanning. However, their terrain scanning effect is very limited. Only exits, [[Garrison Access|Garrisons]], and hidden doors can be detected.\n[[Heading:3]]Structural Interface  (RIF Ability)[[/Heading]]\nStructural Interface is an ability that can randomly be gained when using a RIF installer that provides an indirect source of terrain scanning. Hidden doors and phase walls (primarily inside Garrisons) are instantly revealed on sight, similar to the Structural Scanner.\n[[Heading:3]]Terrain Scanning Infowar Comparison[[/Heading]]\n[[Table]]\nCategory|Terrain Scanners|Structural Scanner|[[Redacted]]Sigix Exoskeleton[[/Redacted]]|Machine Analyzer|Seismic Detector|0b10 Decoder Chip [Scout/Generic]|Structural Interface||\nRange|[[CellStyle:Good]]14-30|[[CellStyle:Neutral]]Visual range|[[CellStyle:Good]]18|[[CellStyle:Good]]Potentially Map-wide|[[CellStyle:Good]]22|[[CellStyle:Good]]25 (square area)|[[CellStyle:Neutral]]Visual range||\nScanning type|[[CellStyle:Good]]Scans tiles at random in range|[[CellStyle:Neutral]]Scans tiles just past visual range|[[CellStyle:Good]][[Redacted]]Scans all tiles in range[[/Redacted]]|[[CellStyle:Neutral]]Scans machines only|[[CellStyle:Bad]]Scans only certain machines|[[CellStyle:Bad]]Scans only exits, Garrisons, and hidden doors|[[CellStyle:Bad]]Scans only hidden doors and phase walls within visual range||\nIgnores scrambling|[[CellStyle:Bad]]No|[[CellStyle:Bad]]No|[[CellStyle:Good]]Yes|[[CellStyle:Good]]Yes|[[CellStyle:Good]]Yes|[[CellStyle:Good]]Yes|[[CellStyle:Good]]Yes||\nSlot requirement|[[CellStyle:Neutral]]1 swappable utility, optionally 1 unswappable utility|[[CellStyle:Good]]1 swappable utility|[[CellStyle:Good]][[Redacted]]3 unswappable propulsion[[/Redacted]]|[[CellStyle:Neutral]]1 unswappable utility|[[CellStyle:Good]]1 swappable utility|[[CellStyle:Neutral]]1 unswappable utility|[[CellStyle:Good]]None||\nAlignment requirement|[[CellStyle:Good]]No|[[CellStyle:Good]]No|[[CellStyle:Neutral]][[Redacted]]Core Reset Matrix + Sigix Exoskeleton[[/Redacted]]|[[CellStyle:Good]]No|[[CellStyle:Good]]No|[[CellStyle:Good]]No|[[CellStyle:Neutral]]RIF||\nUpdate frequency|[[CellStyle:Neutral]]Once per turn, very low rate without processor|[[CellStyle:Good]]Instant|[[CellStyle:Good]]Instant|[[CellStyle:Good]]Instant|[[CellStyle:Good]]Instant|[[CellStyle:Bad]]Infrequent|[[CellStyle:Good]]Instant||\nMap restrictions|[[CellStyle:Good]]N/A|[[CellStyle:Good]]None|[[CellStyle:Good]]N/A|[[CellStyle:Neutral]]0b10 only|[[CellStyle:Good]]N/A|[[CellStyle:Neutral]]0b10 only|[[CellStyle:Good]]None\n[[/Table]]\n[[Heading:2]]Vision Manipulation[[/Heading]]\nUnlike the previous larger categories, there are only 2 types of vision manipulation. [[Cloaking Devices]] reduce vision of hostile bots and [[Visual Processing Units]] increase vision of the bot using them. While they function slightly differently, they serve a similar purpose of allowing additional exploration without being spotted by hostiles.\n[[Heading:3]]Vision Manipulation Infowar Comparison[[/Heading]]\n[[Table]]\nCategory|Cloaking Devices|Visual Processing Units||\nRange|[[CellStyle:Good]]-2 to -6, up to -9 when half_stacked|[[CellStyle:Good]]+2 to +8, not stackable||\nEnergy Upkeep|[[CellStyle:Neutral]]Expensive: -5 to -20 energy per turn|[[CellStyle:Good]]None||\nSlot requirement|[[CellStyle:Good]]1 swappable|[[CellStyle:Neutral]]1 unswappable||\nOther positives|[[CellStyle:Good]]Allows sneaking into areas guarded by bots without being spotted|[[CellStyle:Good]]Allows for seeing further in combat and sniping||\nOther Negatives|[[CellStyle:Neutral]]Low integrity/high coverage, no use if bots are already tracking Cogmind|[[CellStyle:Good]]N/A\n[[/Table]]\n[[Heading:2]]Other Infowar Types[[/Heading]]\n[[Heading:3]][[0b10 Decoder Chips]][[/Heading]]\nWhile some of the decoder chips were mentioned in other categories, as a whole they're an oddball group. They tend to provide intel that crosses in between major categories, while also providing unique intel like part detection.\n[[Heading:3]][[Drone Bays]][[/Heading]]\nDrone bays send out controlled allies to explore the map. Basic drones can only be used for exploration, although other drones can be used for combat purposes as well.\n[[Heading:3]][[ECM Suites]][[/Heading]]\nECM Suites are used to end tracking against Cogmind quicker. Each type of ECM Suite has a multiplier that makes hostile tracking less effective. Additionally, the [[Alert]] gain that occurs when a bot loses tracking on Cogmind does not occur when. While this doesn't help avoid bots in the first place, it is helpful for losing pursuers.\n[[Heading:3]][[Transmission Jammers]][[/Heading]]\nTransmission Jammers are used for several purposes, but generally help prevent communication between hostiles, especially summoning of reinforcements. While in range, they will prevent bots from transmitting tracking data about Cogmind to other allies on spot. This can help pick off bots in a squad 1 by 1 and to eliminate or bypass Watchers even when hostiles are nearby. They can also block [[Alarm Trap|Alarm Traps]] entirely.\n[[Heading:3]]Signal Jamming (RIF Ability)[[/Heading]]\nSignal Jamming is a RIF ability that behaves similar to Transmission Jammers. Instead of requiring a specific part to use, 0b10 bots are jammed based on attached Relay Couplers. Additionally, Alarm Traps are blocked entirely.\n[[Heading:3]][[Trap Scanners]][[/Heading]]\nTrap Scanners do exactly as their name implies: They scan for traps. Trap Scanners add fixed percentage to the chance to detect a trap each turn that one is within Cogmind's line of sight.\n\n[[Heading]]Infowar gallery[[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Sensor Array Activated.webp|A sensor array being activated|\nFarCom Active.webp|FarCom bot detection active, with green ring indicating radius|\nSeismic Detector Activating.webp|Seismic Detector becoming activated and showing seismic activity|IFF Parser.webp|[[IFF Parser]] becoming activated and showing a patrol|\n[[Spoiler]]Quantum Companion Sensors Active.webp[[/Spoiler]]|[[Spoiler]]Quantum Companion bot detection, with blue ring indicating radius[[/Spoiler]]|\n[[Redacted]]Sigix Exoskeleton Sensors.webp[[/Redacted]]|[[Redacted]]Sigix Exoskeleton bot detection and terrain scanning, with blue ring indicating radius[[/Redacted]]|\nRobot Detection With Patrol Navigation.webp|Robot Detection (bots within red ring) and Patrol Navigation (yellow paths)|0b10 Decoder Chip Skirmisher.webp|0b10 Decoder Chip [Skirmisher] detecting a patrol|Terrain Scanning.webp|Basic [[Terrain Scanner]] activating and scanning|Terrain Scanning With Processor.webp|Basic Terrain Scanner activating and scanning with [[Adv.

   "Content": "Access is the last [[0b10]]-controlled main floor that only appears on -1. Access is the most challenging main map with increased patrol density, number of bots per patrol, map size, and level and difficulty in hackable machines compared to [[Research]]. These maps have a 150x300 tile size, either being a tall vertical level or a wide horizontal level. Access maps tend to be fairly well connected across corridors and rooms, and have fewer large rooms and larger hallways more similar to [[Factory]] than the cramped maze-like layout of Research. There are only 2 exits in Access, and locating and taking the desired exit can be especially challenging.\nIn contrast with the small number of exits, Access has the highest number of [[Garrison Access|Garrisons]] with 6 machines spread throughout the level. Shutting or destroying Garrisons is always a good idea, but there is a special interaction in Access: [[Spoiler]]If all 6 Garrisons are shut down or disabled, [[Maximum Security]] will be triggered, sending huge waves of hostiles directly to Cogmind. Either be prepared to fight your way out, or have an escape route planned for a fast airborne build to avoid engaging in combat.[[/Spoiler]]\nThe biggest bot upgrade in Access is the [[Behemoth]] change. All Behemoths will become [[B-99 Colossus|Colossi]], extremely dangerous and hard to kill threats. They have some incredibly good loot, but trying to kill them with conventional methods is difficult due to their high damage output, high integrity, and [[Adv. Force Field]] reducing damage they take. Avoiding them or running if spotted is usually the best plan.\n[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]\nThere is one special machine in Access. The Energy Cycler is a large explosive machine that appears in rooms with a 2 tile wide doorway. When it is destroyed, several [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]] will spawn from Garrisons and start roaming around the map. Additionally, all of the sealed heavy doors on the map will retract, allowing access to exits.\n\n[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]\n[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Access Level[[/Lore]]\n\n[[Heading]]Notable Locations[[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Access Energy Cycler.png|Energy Cycler machine|Access Surface Exit.png|Exit to [[Surface]]|Access Command Entrance.png|Exit to [[Command]] guarded by [[H-88 Terminator|Terminators]] and [[B-99 Colossus|Colossi]][[/Gallery]]\n[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]\nThere are 2 types of exits on Access floors.

They are both identifiable by look alone:\n[[List]][[Surface]] exit: There are 2 sides to this Surface exit. One side is locked behind an 80 armor Sealed Barrier locked by a [[Terminal]] with a base 7% open chance. The other side has Sealed Heavy Doors that are much easier to break through, but is guarded by 2 Colossi. Blowing up the Energy Cyclers will open only the side with the Sealed Barrier. Trying to rush head-on past the Behemoths is usually not recommended due to their extreme damage output and heavy knockback.|[[Redacted]][[Command]] exit: There are 2 sides to this Command exit. One side has a 2 tile snaking corridor that has 3 consecutive Sealed Barriers. Each has a base 30% open chance.

Access_0 is a very heavily combat-oriented map that has 2 unique wintypes available and has the Architect present, a special boss bot that will award a + on the scoresheet when defeated. It features a multitude of unique bots, a unique bossfight mechanic, and many of the strongest hostiles in the game to fight.\nThe overall structure of Access_0 can be split into 2 groups with a small bridge connecting section guarded by [[A2]].\n\n[[Heading]]Layout[[/Heading]]\nThe bulk of the map is on the right side, with the bridge dividing a small section of the left side of the map. Overall, the layout is comparable to a more maze-like [[Caves]]. There are many dead ends and nearly-connected areas that can be safely dug out when noticed with terrain scanning. Cogmind spawns on the right side of the map along with the Architect, [[A8]], and 2 [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]]. The right side of the map can contain [[Alien Artifacts|Alien Artifact]]-containing Workstation machines, large item caches on the ground or in Reinforced Shells, random bits of machinery, and Subspace Access Nodes. Typically, there are 4 Access Nodes on the right side of the map, although very rarely one can appear on the left. Otherwise, the left side can contain all the same things that the right side has and a few more. The left side will always contain a Singularity Gate machine along with a Gate Controls Terminal that can control it. At the bottom left of the map, there is an Architect Logs Terminal wrapped in a 120 armor Architect Shell.\n[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]\n[[Heading:3]]Subspace Access Node[[/Heading]]\nThere are 4 of these Access Nodes, also known as \"pads\" on the map. They serve as nodes for the Architect to appear at after teleporting out. Destroying all 4 is required to fight the Architect normally.\n[[Heading:3]]Singularity Gate[[/Heading]]\nA large and fragile machine on the left side of the map. If this machine is intact when the Architect is destroyed, a countdown of 10 turns will begin. If Cogmind is still on the map and the gate is not destroyed in that timeframe, Cogmind will be instantly destroyed. It is possible to activate the machine by performing the Gate Test 138-A and Gate Test 138-B hacks. This will an approximately 5 tile radius singularity that draws bots and parts in and destroys them instantly if the center is reached. This singularity will stop if the gate is destroyed. The Architect will intentionally target the gate to break it while in this state. The Gate Test 138-END will shut down the singularity. One additional hack, 138-C, requires the [[A2 Data Core]] which can be achieved by destroying A2. Performing this hack will immediately end the run and result in a [[Wintypes|W5 Wintype]]. If the singularity gate is still intact when the Architect is destroyed, the gate will be activated and can not be shut down by normal means. Cogmind must exit the map within 10 turns or destroy the singularity gate or else Cogmind will be instantly destroyed. If Cogmind exits the map while the countdown is going off, this will result a W6 wintype.\n[[Heading:3]]Architect Logs[[/Heading]]\nThe Architect shell has 120 armor and is extremely difficult to break through by force. However, defeating the Architect will drop the [[Architect Data Core]] which will result in the shell retracting and revealing the inner Terminal that contains a large number of unique lore entries.\n[[Heading:3]]Dimensional Slip Node[[/Heading]]\nThere is a Dimensional Slip node installed near the top of the map. Using a [[Transdimensional Reconstructor|regular]] or [[Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor]] will always go to this location. An exit is a few tiles away from this spot. If the Architect is still alive when Cogmind appears here, the log message [[GameText]]I have more important things to do than play hide-and-seek. Deal with this piece of junk if it returns.[[/GameText]] will appear, and the Architect will disappear off of the map and will not return.\n\n[[Heading]]Notable Locations[[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Access_0 Sigix Corpse.png|Analysis Chamber machine with [[Sigix Corpse]]|Access_0 Alien Artifact.png|Workstation machine containing Alien Artifact|Access_0 Subspace Access Node.png|Subspace Access Node machine|Access_0 Singularity Gate.png|The Singularity Gate machine|Access_0 Active Singularity Gate.gif|Active Singularity Gate destroying parts|Access_0 Architect Logs.png|Architect Logs Terminal with shell|Access_0 Cache 1.png|Sealed Reinforced Shell (40 armor) cache|Access_0 Cache 2.png|Open Reinforced Shell cache|Access_0 Cache 3.png|Another sealed cache variant|Access_0 Cache 4.png|Another opened cache variant|Access_0 Cache 5.png|A cache variant with all items on the ground|Access_0 Entrance.png|Entrance assault with the Architect, A8, and 2 Enhanced Grunts|Access_0 Bridge.png|The \"bridge\" guarded by A2|Access_0 Enhanced Sentry.png|Guard post with [[Enhanced Sentry]]|Access_0 Enhanced Grunts.png|Guard post with Enhanced Grunts[[/Gallery]]\n[[Heading:2]]Caches[[/Heading]]There are several types of caches in Access_0, although they all draw from the same pool of potential items. This pool contains all rating 6-9 [[Prototype Part|Prototype]] parts accessible normally in 0b10 in stockpiles. It does not include any unique parts such as items found in [[Testing]] shells. These Prototype parts will never be faulty.\n[[Heading:2]]Alien Artifacts[[/Heading]]\nThere are typically multiple Alien Artifacts held in 40 armor Workstation machines. If there are any, one will be guaranteed to be a Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor. The full list of available Alien Artifacts are:\n[[List]][[Core Expander]]|[[Core Regenerator]]|[[Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor]]|[[Integrated Dissipator]]|[[Integrated Mediator]]|[[Integrated Reactor]]|[[Integrity Redistributor]]|[[Sigix Broadsword]][[/List]]\n[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]There is a single exit in Access_0. A [[Surface]] exit is buried behind several dozen tiles of earth near the top of the map. It can be accessed via the Dimensional Slip Node by using a regular or Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor or by digging deep into the earth.\n\n[[Heading]]Special bots[[/Heading]]\n[[Heading:2]]The [[Architect]][[/Heading]]\nThe Architect is the true final boss of Cogmind. It has a multitude of strong offensive and defensive parts, resistances to most common damage types, 400 core, innate core and part regeneration, perfect always-active tracking on Cogmind's position, and a whopping 28 speed to top it all off. There is also a unique mechanic where the Architect will teleport to a nearby Subspace Access Node under various conditions. This includes: falling to 80% of core integrity (320/400), losing 2/3 Modified Sigix Shearguns, or becoming overweight. It will always have [[Perfect Tracking]] on Cogmind and never give up pursuit. It also has \"Behemoth AI\", where it will try to shoot Cogmind through several layers of tiles. This can be exploited by moving behind walls where repeated shots will take out wall tiles instead of hitting Cogmind.\nThe Architect can not be destroyed by most methods unless all 4 of the subspace access nodes are destroyed first. The one exception to this rule is that dealing 400 core damage in a single turn can destroy the Architect. While technically possible with a large enough weapon volley, this method of killing is primarily reserved to a few unique weapons, like the [[BFG-9k Vortex Edition]], the [[L-Cannon]], a [[Sigix Exoskeleton]]-boosted [[Core Cannon]], or 2 Core Cannons.\n[[Heading:3]]Special Weapon Interactions[[/Heading]]\nThere are a few weapons that have special interactions with the Architect.\n[[Heading:4]][[Sigix Terminator]]/[[Supercharged Sigix Terminator]][[/Heading]]\nUsing either of these weapons will cause the Architect to wrap to the nearest subspace node, resulting in the log message [[GameText]]I'm all too familiar with what that does.[[/GameText]] This effect will only occur if one or more subspace nodes are intact. Due to the way the Architect teleports, it is possible to hit it with the explosion, but only if the pad that the Architect teleports to is within range. This can be used to take out the last pad and land a hit on the Architect at the same time.\n[[Heading:4]][[L-Cannon]][[/Heading]]\nSimilar to the terminators, it is not possible to hit the Architect with the L-Cannon unless the subspace nodes are all destroyed. The log message [[GameText]]I'm aware you stole the capacitor, you know...[[/GameText]] will accompany the Architect teleporting to the nearest subspace node. Even if the nodes are taken down, destroying the singularity gate is required before using the L-Cannon for the killing blow. Otherwise Cogmind will be crushed in the 10 turn countdown since the weapon itself takes 10 turns of delay after firing.\n[[Heading:3]]Self-destruct codes[[/Heading]]\nIf any Enhanced bots or A bots are assimilated by disruption and rewiring or via the [[Field Lobotomy Kit]] and the Architect spots them, a log message [[GameText]]Architect flashes a signal at [Bot Name].[[/GameText]] will appear, and the bot will self-destruct. Bots that self-destruct will drop loot normally according to their salvage. This usually results in some pretty large loot pile explosions, especially for some of the lower numbered A bots. Although these bots cannot be used as allies, assimilation is a good way to let the Architect get rid of them rather than fighting them yourself.\n[[Heading:3]]Defeat[[/Heading]]\nThe Architect is a sore loser. If destroyed, the Singularity Gate will be activated (if intact) and trigger a 10 turn countdown. Cogmind must either use a Transdimensional Reconstructor and escape out the exit at the top of the map near the Slip Node or destroy the Gate machine within these 10 turns to avoid instant death.\n[[Heading:2]][[A bots]][[/Heading]]\nThe A bots are a series of very powerful and unique enemies, most of which only appearing in Access_0 or are allies on other maps. A8 appears at the entrance to the map and A2 guards the \"bridge\" to the left side of the map. [[A7]] does not appear on this map at all. Other than that, [[A6]], [[A5]], [[A4]], and [[A3]] all appear after Cogmind has explored a certain percentage of the map. They appear at roughly 10-15%, 25-30%, 45-50%, and 70-75% map exploration respectively. This is only affected by tiles seen by Cogmind and not other forms of intel such as drones or terrain scanning. If A8 was destroyed in [[Zion]], or A5 was in [[Lab]], they will not appear in Access_0. All A bots also maintain perfect tracking on Cogmind and can not be shaken.\n[[Heading:2]][[Enhanced Programmer|Enhanced Programmers]][[/Heading]]\nEnhanced Programmers are a unique type of bot that can show up in Access_0, but only under certain conditions. Using the [[Data Miner|Data Miner's]] [[Data Conduit]] or bringing more than 2 combat allies (bots with weapons) into the map will trigger these bots to spawn. They are extremely tough bots with many resistances and carry an [[Adv. Remote Force Field]] that will shield other allies. They will roam around the map as lone patrol bots.\n\n[[Heading]]Unlockable Architect Logs[[/Heading]]\nSimilar to the Lab orders, there are some unique lore entries in the Architect Logs that can only be obtained by performing specific actions before that point. To read these logs, Cogmind must either defeat the Architect or have a strong enough weapon to break through the 120 armor shell that also doesn't break the frail Terminal inside it.\n[[List]]Log L.L98W4A5V: Use the Data Miner's Data Conduit.\n|Log L.MJH3MJHF: Save [[Revision 17]] in [[Cetus]] by defeating all of the [[Cetus Guard|Cetus Guards]].

Revision 17 must also survive until Cogmind exits the map on -3.\n|Log L.PLVSNE0F: Trigger the Revision 17 invasion event, but Revision 17 must die in -3.\n|Log L.SWO95LD1: Expose [[Zhirov]] by destroying the Cloak Generator machine at [[Zhirov (Location)]], and kill Zhirov himself before he teleports away.\n|Log L.T4KTHQWA: Expose Zhirov by destroying the Cloak Generator machine, but he must survive the attack and teleport away.\n|Log L.UHGC2ASH: Fail to ally with [[Warlord]] in [[Warlord (Location)]] by either being [[Imprint|Imprinted]] or by not visiting Warlord in the map.

   "Content": "Armory is a [[0b10]]-controlled [[Factory]]/[[Research]] [[Branch]] that appears between -4 and -3. It is a tough map with tight corridors, few available paths, an above average number of patrols, and special dormant and guard bots. There are several unique types of patrols on this map as well, with a [[Demolisher]] leading a squad of [[Grunt|Grunts]] and [[Duelist]] squads with a [[Protector]] in tow. Stealth builds will have a difficult time of sneaking past unnoticed and combat hostiles must be ready to do a lot of killing to get by. If Cogmind can survive, some of the rewards are rewirable allies, a high number of [[Fabricator|Fabricators]], and large stockpiles of out-of-depth parts.\nThe overall map structure varies, but there are some common features of Armory maps. There are usually corridors running horizontally on the bottom and top of the map that contain large rooms next to each other connected by Emergency Access doors. The map can be a little maze-like although heading to the left and crossing from bottom to top or top to bottom will usually lead to an exit.\n[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]\nThere is one type of special machine in Armory. The Energy Cycler is a large explosive machine that will open all Sealed Heavy Doors on the map and summon several patrols.

The log message [[GameText]]Weapon containment breached. Dispatching heavy reinforcements to the area.[[/GameText]] will appear and 2 assault [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]] will be dispatched to the location.

    "Proximity Caves"
   ],
   "ImageName": "Caves.png",
   "Content": "Caves is the most frequent [[Branch]] map throughout all of [[Factory]] depths. It is a non-[[0b10]]-controlled map where [[Derelict|Derelicts]] often roam free and hostile 0b10 squads patrol and can be taken out without fear of reinforcements. Non-patrolling 0b10 outposts guarded by a [[Sentry]] and dormant bots are common. Every depth has 2 guaranteed Caves exits and each Caves map is a part of a series of 3 maps in a row. Not counting event-based exits, all first Caves maps of each depth can only be exited by entering the second Caves map. Caves maps do not have very many regular parts on the ground, but piles of [[Scrap]] contain usable but partially damaged parts and [[Derelict Log|Derelict Logs]] can give unique intel about upcoming floors.\nThere are different names for the different types of Caves maps and they have slightly different characteristics. Lower Caves is the name given to the first 2 Caves maps on -7 and -6, while Caves maps on -5 and -4 are named Upper Caves. The third caves map is accessible only by exiting the depth-specific special branch at the left side of the second caves map and is called Proximity Caves, regardless of depth. Lower and Upper Caves are very similar in all but [[Robot Tier]], but Proximity Caves tends to be more densely populated with patrols, in addition to potentially having higher-tier robot variants due being one depth above the Caves that lead to them. They also contain [[N-01 Spotter|Spotters]] that will report armed hostiles on sight, causing a 150 alert increase per spot when entering the next map. This caps at 900 alert gained.\nCaves are patrolled lightly by hostile 0b10 bots compared to the main floors. [[Infowar]] utilities are a good option to avoid unnecessary encounters as many patrols can be avoided with a bit of patience. Caves have a unique mechanic where parts dropped from 0b10 bots will automatically self-destruct after a few turns. Looting must be done quickly or else the dropped parts will be lost forever. The only 2 ways around this mechanic are [[Self-destruct Interrupter|Self-destruct Interrupters]] and [[Electromagnetic Weapons]]. The interrupters will prevent the parts from frying while active and EM damage will interfere with the self-destruct mechanism. While EM will give [[Corrupted Parts]], it is far better to end up with corrupted parts than to end up with no parts at all.\nDue to the low rate of good parts spawning on the floor and the overall difficulty in looting hostile 0b10 bots, it is very easy for an unprepared build to fall apart in these maps. Bringing plenty of spares into Caves is highly recommended to avoid running out of essentials like propulsion, weapons, and armor. [[Launchers]] are a must here to handle ambushes of large numbers of 0b10 bots hiding in outposts. Launchers are also incredibly useful when entering a Caves map because the standard spawn protection that is present in 0b10 maps doesn't apply here. That means that one (or more) patrols can appear right in Cogmind's face on entering a map.\nCaves are also the most common place to encounter the [[Decomposer|Decomposers]], [[Packrat|Packrats]] and [[Samaritan|Samaritans]] neutral Derelict bot classes. They tend to appear in single-class groups of three. Decomposers will collect all stray debris, parts, Scrap piles and [[Derelict Log|Derelict Logs]] they happen to find and will break them down into matter they then leave on the floor, potentially destroying valuable parts or intel. In some cases, the matter yielded this way may be useful, but in most cases destroying these bots as quickly as possible is highly recommended.\nThe 0b10 [[Minesweeper]] class can also be found in caves near Derelict [[Traps]], guarded by 0-2 [[Grunt|Grunts]]. If destroyed, the Traps they extracted will be dropped and won't self-destruct, and can be re-used to deal with 0b10 patrols or plan attacks on outposts.\n\n[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]\n[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Caves[[/Lore]]\n\n[[Heading]]Navigation[[/Heading]]\nCave maps all have a very similar overall layout. While the paths within the caves are unpredictable, these maps can typically be divided into 6 equal chunks. Top left, top middle, top right, bottom left, bottom middle, and bottom right. Cogmind will always spawn from the top right or bottom right chunks in Lower and Upper Caves or the top left or bottom left chunks in Proximity caves. One exit will always be in the chunk furthest from Cogmind. In the second Lower or Upper Caves map, the unique branch exit will be in that furthest chunk and the exit back to the main floor will always be on the same side. A good rule of thumb is that left is away from 0b10 while right is toward 0b10.\n\n[[Heading:2]]Checkpoints[[/Heading]]\nCaves checkpoints are square-shaped open spaces with a guard positioned at the center with possibly other robots stationed nearby.\nThere are three types of checkpoints:\n[[Table]]\nCentral guard|Alignment|Square size|Possible additional guards|Formation||\n[[Mutant]]|Friendly (Warlord)|7x7|0, 2 or 4 [[Thug|Thugs]], [[Butcher|Butchers]] or [[Savage|Savages]]|X, / or \\-shaped||\nSentry|Hostile (0b10)|7x7|[[Swarmer|Swarmers]], [[Grunt|Grunts]], [[Duelist|Duelists]] or [[Brawler|Brawlers]]|Chaotic||\n[[Behemoth]]|Hostile (0b10)|6x6|None|N/A\n[[/Table]]\n[[Gallery]]\nCaves Hostile Guards.png|0b10 checkpoint|\nCaves Friendly Derelicts.png|Warlord checkpoint[[/Gallery]]\n\n[[Heading:2]]Outposts[[/Heading]]\nOutposts make up the most common type of guarded structure found within Caves. There are a lot of types of outposts, differing in shape, size, guards, rewards and sometimes events. Although their walls are visually identical to regular cave walls, outpost structures are always fully disconnected from regular cave walls. While some are controlled by friendly Derelicts, most outposts are controlled by 0b10 bots (or rarely by hostile Derelicts). Most Caves map will have exactly one functional 0b10 outpost.\n[[Transmission Jammer|Transmission Jammers]] are highly recommended to take bots in these hostile outposts out one at a time without getting overwhelmed. In some hostile encounters, [[Sentry|Sentries]] can call for a reinforcement [[Assault Squad]]. In the first Caves map each depth only no reinforcements will come as there is no 0b10-controlled exit. Killing the Sentries as quickly as possible is highly recommended in all other cases. Sentries capable of calling reinforcements will only do so when they are both tracking Cogmind and in Cogmind's field of view. Whether the Sentries themselves see Cogmind is irrelevant. In addition, Sentries in 0b10 outposts are one variant tier higher (if possible) than the current depth's Sentries. Fighting these outposts is a bad idea for an unprepared build, but larger outposts with [[Terminal]] intel are very valuable. This intel can be the same as the intel found in [[Derelict Log|Derelict Logs]]. Outpost Terminals' hack lists are entirely composed of \"report\" hacks, some of which yield intel, while the others yield only fluff text. Fluff records will always be listed first, so it's a good idea to hack the records at the bottom of the list.\nAvoiding confrontation with most hostile outposts is usually fairly simple, especially with help from infowar utilities, though be wary of [[Corruption]] effects such as IFF bursts or weapon misfires that could attract unwanted attention, as well as nearby 0b10 patrols that could alert the dormant bots inside.\n\n[[Heading:3]]0b10 Outposts (Small)[[/Heading]]\nThe most common type of outposts are small 0b10 outposts. They are square-shaped, have 1-2 hidden doorways on their sides, and are separated from regular cave walls by a minimum distance of 1 tile. Their main entrance is guarded on their outside by a Sentry, and contain a random mix of 4-6 dormant bots, which can be Swarmers, Grunts, Duelists or Brawlers. Those guards are stationed in front of the internal machinery. These outposts also contain 1-2 slightly damaged rewireable disabled robots. The Sentry will always try to call for a reinforcement Assault Squad.\nThese are also tend to be the most difficult type of 0b10 outposts to avoid attracting the attention of, due the the Sentry guarding it from the outside, as well as the usually close distance to cave walls that makes going around these outposts dangerous as well due to the hidden doorways. Using [[Terrain Scanners|Terrain Scanning]] and/or a [[Structural Scanner]] can help identify the position and field of view of the Sentry, as well as the location of hidden doorways.\n[[Gallery]]Caves Outpost 2.png|Small 0b10 outpost, with 6 dormant bots, 2 rewireable bots, and a hidden doorway.[[/Gallery]]\n\n[[Heading:3]]0b10 Outposts (Medium)[[/Heading]]\nLike all 0b10 outposts, medium 0b10 outposts are square-shaped. They contain an intel Terminal, some hidden doorways, dormant Grunts and/or Swarmers and are separated from regular cave walls by a minimum distance of 2 tiles. There are two primary variations of medium 0b10 outposts. The first has an Outpost Generator inside, and may not contain a Sentry. The second is guaranteed to have a Sentry, as well as a cache of 4 weapons (all the same) in a corner, which can be accessed without risk of getting spotted by destroying the outside wall.\nThere are two additional variations based on the second's structure. One has been \"reappropriated\" by friendly derelicts, with all of the outpost's structure left intact, aside from the weapon cache's shell. A broken and heavily damaged 0b10 bot remains, the weapon cache contains four different parts, and the 0b10 intel Terminal has been replaced with a Derelict intel terminal, which can be freely hacked. The last variation is a largely destroyed version of the outpost, where the terminal is useless and the weapon cache mostly pillaged.\n\n[[Gallery]]Caves Outpost 1.png|Medium 0b10 outpost with no Sentries, with an explosive Outpost Generator, a hidden doorway, and 7 dormant bots guarding an intel Terminal.|Caves Reappropriated Outpost.png|\"Reappropriated\" Derelict outpost.|Caves Outpost 3.png|Abandoned 0b10 outpost.[[/Gallery]]\n\n[[Heading:3]]0b10 Outposts (Large)[[/Heading]]\nLike all 0b10 outposts, large 0b10 outposts are square-shaped. They contain 1-2 Sentries, an intel Terminal, a weapon cache, 6 dormant Grunts and 6 dormant Swarmers, and are separated from regular cave walls by a minimum distance of 2 tile. Like medium 0b10 outposts, weapon caches can be accessed from the outside without drawing attention by breaking the outer wall.\nThere are two primary variations of large 0b10 outposts. The first has one sentry and a cache of 4 weapons. The other is separated into two main parts, contains 2 Sentries, an Outpost Generator, and a large cache of 8 weapons.\nThere are also largely destroyed sub-variations of these, in which the terminal is useless and the weapon cache largely pillaged. In addition, some of these destroyed variants may rarely get suddenly infested by [[Assembled (4)|Assembled]], making them unsafe to explore without a Launcher. In case of infestation, blowing up the Outpost Generator if there is one could destroy a large portion of the Assembled.\n\n[[Gallery]]Caves Mega Outpost 2.png|Large 0b10 outpost with 1 Sentry, 6 dormant Swarmers, 6 dormant Grunts, a weapon cache and an intel Terminal.|\nCaves Mega Outpost.png|Large 0b10 outpost with 2 Sentries, 6 dormant Swarmers, 6 dormant Grunts, an Outpost Generator, a large weapon cache and an intel Terminal.|\nCaves Outpost Assembled Invasion.png|[[Assembled (4)|Assembled]] infesting an abandoned outpost.[[/Gallery]]\n\n\n[[Heading:3]]Warlord Outposts[[/Heading]]\nWarlordoutposts are circle-shaped, with a main entrance controlled by a Door Terminal. They are guarded by a [[Commander]] and several other Derelict bots that wander around the inside, and contain a few parts as well as an intel Terminal. The inside of the outpost is also reinforced by a \"Wall Reinforcements\" structure, which has an armor of 35. There are two main structural variants, one of which has a centered orthogonal entrance.\n\nThe Derelicts inside these outposts are friendly, and the Commander can even dispatch an escort for Cogmind. This escort will leave when reaching the next map, even if the next map is also a Caves map.\n\nThere are two additional sub-variants of Warlord outposts. The first is a sub-variant of the centered orthogonal entrance variant that has been invaded by 0b10 forces, including two [[Programmer|Programmers]], two Swarmers and one Sentry that cannot call for reinforcements but will identify Cogmind as \"Derelict reinforcements\". The intel Terminal can be safely accessed from the outside by destroying one of the walls, and while the bots inside will most likely spot Cogmind, they will not be able to exit the Outpost if no other entrance was opened. The other sub-variation is largely destroyed, where the Terminal is useless.\n\n[[Gallery]]Caves Friendly Warlord Outpost.png|Warlord outpost (centered orthogonal entrance variant)|\nCaves Invaded Warlord Outpost.png|0b10-controlled Warlord outpost|\nCaves Attacked Warlord Outpost.png|Attacked Warlord Derelict outpost[[/Gallery]]\n\n[[Heading:3]][[Sapper]] Outposts[[/Heading]]\nSapper Outposts are structurally very similar to regular Caves layouts and as such can be difficult to identify with purely visual means. They are separated from regular cave walls by a minimum distance of 1 tile. They are fairly rare, and contain several friendly Sappers and Sapper parts, including [[Thermoblaster|Thermoblasters]], [[Mak. Ablative Armor|Mak. Ablative Armors]] and [[Sapper Charge|Sapper Charges]].\nThese outposts may get attacked by two [[Assault Squad|Assaults]]. Since these Assaults can only enter the map from 0b10-controlled exits, they will always approach from the eastern side of the map, likely making them easy to avoid. \n\n[[Gallery]]Caves Sapper Base.png|Friendly outpost of Sappers[[/Gallery]]\n\n[[Heading:3]]Hostile Derelict Outposts[[/Heading]]\nHostile Derelict outposts are structurally inelegant and are separated from regular cave walls by a minimum distance of 1 tile. They have 1-2 hostile Derelicts standing guard outside the structure, sometimes from positions far from any entrances, preventing them from getting quick help when spotting intruders. These outposts contain several active hostile Derelicts, some disabled Derelicts, and a few Derelict parts.\n[[Gallery]]Caves Hostile Derelicts Outpost.png|Hostile Derelict outpost, with two disabled Butchers, and a Thug standing guard at the bottom-left, far from any entrances, preventing them from getting quick backup from the Derelicts inside.[[/Gallery]]\n\n\n[[Heading:2]]Huge 0b10 Bases[[/Heading]]\nHuge 0b10 bases are fairly rare, can only appear within Proximity Caves, and will only ever appear at the upper-right corner of the map. These bases have a enormous size of 46x46, a main four-door entrance on their left side, a secondary two-door entrance on their bottom side near the right edge of the map, and are mostly or completely made out of [[Reinforced Walls|Reinforced Barriers]]. If one of these prefabs appears, its top-right corner will contain the map's only exit as part of the prefab, forcing Cogmind to infiltrate the base.\nThese huge two-entrance prefabs tend to constrain the map generation process and noticeably affect the rest of the map, potentially creating unusual layouts such as extremely long corridors. There are two variations of huge 0b10 bases, both very different from the other.\n[[List]]\nIncomplete well-defended base - A large structure guarded by multiple 0b10 bot classes and maintained by two [[R-10 Processor|R-10 Processors]] and two [[U-05 Engineer|U-05 Engineers]].\nFour lone combat bots patrol the interior, each either a Grunt, a Duelist or a Brawler.\nThe main entrance leads to a trapped room guarded by a Sentry and a Behemoth, making it the toughest way to enter the structure.\nThe secondary entrance leads into a long corridor with two indents each containing a [[Watcher]]. The room in front of the corridor is empty. The room to the right contains five rewireable Swarmers or five rewireable [[E-15 Imp|Saboteurs]], guarded by three Sentries which will be alerted by the secondary entrance's Watchers if those are not jammed.\nIn the middle of the two entrances is the incomplete Matter storage room, whose southern walls are regular cave walls. Some of the Earth tiles near the bottom-left of the prefab can be dug out and traveled freely without risk of [[Cave-ins|cave-ins]] (as they do not glow like regular dug-out tiles), making it possible to easily access the base through the incomplete Matter storage room.\nIn the center of the base is the explosive Base Generator, guarded by a Protector and a Sentry.\nThe top-left corner of the base is mostly unfinished, featuring incomplete machinery and walls, as well as a functional [[Fabricator]] near a few matter pods and a [[Recycling Unit]].\nThe two completed rooms in the upper-middle of the prefab each contain three different part stockpiles. Below these rooms are two incomplete rooms. The one to the left contains two dormant [[Hunter|Hunters]], and the one to the right contains four unpowered [[C-30 ARC|C-30 ARCs]], as well as four rewireable Grunts and two rewireable Hunters OR four rewireable Duelists and two rewireable [[Specialist|Specialists]].\nThe top right room of the base contains four dormant Swarmers or four dormant Grunts, two caches of two stockpiles of three parts each, and the map's only exit. The room's lower entrance can be accessed from the outside by opening the Sealed Heavy Doors using the associated Door Terminal.\nAdditionally, the base might get attacked by a large number of Derelicts when Cogmind first enters it.\n\n|[[Demolisher]] testing base - Contains a large empty space used for testing Demolishers, at the center of which [[Target Drone|Target Drones]] are periodically launched. There are four active groups consisting of one Demolisher and one [[Protector]] each, each guarding one of each side of the Target Drone Dispatcher[[Comment]]I think there was a better way to word that sentence about the location and composition of active units within the base.[[/Comment]]. The Demolishers will attempt to destroy the Target Drones launched, though sometimes those will sometimes escape to the outside of the base. The top-left room of the base contains five unpowered or disabled Demolishers, as well as two caches of Launchers. The room opposite the base's main entrance contains a large stockpile of matter. There are several unpowered C-30 ARCs near the exit at the top-right corner of the base.\n\n[[/List]]\n\n\n[[Gallery]]Caves Huge Base.png|Proximity Caves huge 0b10 base exit.|Caves Demolisher Base.png|Proximity Caves Demolisher testing base exit.[[/Gallery]]\n\n[[Heading:2]]Ambushes[[/Heading]]\nSome hostile Derelicts and 0b10 robots will wait in ambush to attack enemies or sometimes specifically Cogmind as they pass through.\n[[List]]\nThug-guarded hostile Derelict ambush - A hostile Thug guards the entrance to a small recess in the cave walls containing three dormant hostile Derelicts, which will be woken up by the Thug without a Transmission Jammer.\n|[[Thief]] base ambush - A Thief base containing several presumably stolen parts, one of which may be placed just outside the entrance to lure in potential victims. A Transmission Jammer may allow fighting each thief one by one, though attacking these bases may not be worth getting parts stolen.\n|0b10 ambush - Two Hunters and one Programmer hidden behind a solid wall. When Cogmind approaches, the wall will break open to let the 0b10 bots attack. This ambush can only reliably be detected through the use of a [[Sensor Array|Sensor Arrays]], a Terrain Scanner with good [[Terrain Scan Processors|Terrain Scanner Processing]], or a [[Deep Structural Scanner]].\n|Random Thief ambush - A lone Thief suddenly appears from outside FOV.[[Comment]]I'm not entirely sure about that one. Is that a real  ambush, or just a wandering Thief? It's hard to tell sometimes.[[/Comment]]\n|[[Spoiler]][[Master Thief]] ambush - If Cogmind has stolen from the [[Exiles (Location)|Exiles]], Master Thieves may appear near the entrances or exits of Caves maps and will only target and attack Cogmind. Their ambushes may cause some nearby prefabs, such as [[Caves#0b10_outposts_small|small 0b10 outposts]], to wind up empty of bots. This can sometimes be used to predicts exit-of-Caves-map ambushes and prepare accordingly, though by the time an empty prefab is noticed, the attack may already have started. When attacking near the end of Caves maps, they appear from outside Cogmind's FOV, which may potentially draw in nearby 0b10 patrols. Master Thieves are nearly undetectable through Sensor Arrays due to their level 4 Scan Cloak trait, and cannot be detected through a [[Seismic Detector]] due to their airborne Propulsion.[[/Spoiler]] \n[[/List]]\n[[Gallery]]Caves Hostile Thug.png|Hostile Derelict ambush - 1 [[Thug]], 3 dormant [[Savage|Savages]].|Caves Thief Base.png|[[Thief]] base with some presumably stolen parts.|Caves Hunter Programmer Ambush.png|0b10 ambush - The walls on the southern side of the bots will break if Cogmind gets too close.[[/Gallery]]\n\n[[Heading:2]]Other Caches/Hidden Locations[[/Heading]]\nThere are a lot of possible hidden prefabs in Caves maps. Some are hidden behind solid walls, others around corners, and some others are mostly in plain sight but somewhat out of the way.\n\n[[Heading:3]]Hidden Research Stations[[/Heading]]\nFour of the hidden prefabs are research stations, where a Derelict does science of some kind. Each of these prefabs may only appear once across all Caves maps, and they are not guaranteed to appear. [[Comment]]There's probably a better way to phrase that these prefabs are \"unique but not guaranteed\".[[/Comment]]\n[[List]]\n[[Tinkerer]] hiding behind some [[Assembled (4)|Assembled]] - Fluff encounter.

When spotting the Tinkerer, they will explain that they are about to be attacked, and entrust Cogmind with their [[Molecular Deconstructor]] prototype, as well as the password to access it. Some time after this, 0b10 hostiles including Programmers, Specialists and Hunters will appear nearby along with an announcement: [[GameText]]PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: Unaware incursion detected. Likely classification: Search and Destroy. And maybe Retrieve. Something like that, yeah.[[/GameText]]\n[[GameText]]\"They're coming to take away my research again!\"[[/GameText]]\n[[GameText]]\"You're not Unaware, and look menacing enough... take it and get as far away from here as you can.

Sometimes another Derelict can be encountered near the C-55 Analyst's hiding spot, explaining that they were following a lone Researcher but lost track of them. Upon entering, the [[Researcher]] will explain their situation, and will then roam the map aimlessly. The [[Core Expander]] is so powerful that it alone can be a good reason to go into Caves, even though this prefab isn't guaranteed to show up.\n[[GameText]]C-55 Analyst: \"How did you find me???

These will contain either only [[Dirty Datajack|Dirty Datajacks]] or only [[Self-destruct Interrupter|Self-destruct Interrupters]]. They can only be detected through Terrain Scanning, Structural Scanning or rarely Caves map layout derelict intel. The Self-destruct Interrupters inside those caches are capable of preventing the self-destruction of nearby unaware parts, possibly indicating their presence.\n|Many caches are hidden inside of difficult-to-spot paths, usually requiring diagonal movement to enter. The paths may be trapped with friendly Derelict Traps[[Comment]]Part of what i'm saying here is effectively \"trapped with traps\", maybe there's a way to avoid that repeat?[[/Comment]], so be careful when corrupted. These will either contain a handful of parts, in which case the cache may be additionally protected by a Sealed Door and the relevant Derelict Door Terminal, or several Dirty Datajacks.\n|Some caches contain a large amount of [[Scrap]]. These Scrap rooms aren't very well hidden, and sometimes have a functional door separating them from the rest of the caves. Fully looting these Scrap piles may be difficult, as they will quickly fill the small space they're contained within, possibly preventing some Scrap piles from yielding everything they otherwise would have.\n|Some caches are hidden behind a Sealed Door and its relevant Derelict Door Terminal, and contain a large number of parts. These may occasionally contain a friendly dormant Derelict guard.\n|[[Spoiler]]DNI cache - A unique prefab protected by Reinforced Barriers and Sealed Doors, containing a [[Dimensional Node Initializer]] and a fluff lore Terminal.\n[[GameText]]>>Record \"Note to 6F-MQ2\"\nI took this from a Hauler that was behaving strangely.

Both common and easy to find. Those bots' parts can be helpful if Cogmind is in a bad state, though be wary if corrupted, as the area may contain friendly Derelict Traps.\nNon-combat Derelict bot graveyard - A small slightly hidden room containing lots of broken non-combat Derelict bots, including Decomposers[[Comment]]It's been a while, i'm not sure Decomposers can appear in those graveyards, but they probably can?

Does it actually work as a sentence?[[/Comment]]\nBroken [[A-27 Freighter|Freighter]] - A Broken Freighter and Broken Specialist guard in a small slightly concealed room. There may be a friendly derelict guarding the outside. The Freighter contains intact prototype parts. If Cogmind spots the broken Freighter, it is possible a new Freighter and smaller than usual escort of a Protector and C-30 ARC will be sent to retrieve the parts.\nGuarded [[Hauler]] - A Grunt squad guarding a Hauler slightly out-of-sight inside a dead end.

This exit is typically on the far right side of the map. Sometimes this exit is heavily guarded and part of an 0b10 base.|Caves exit: In the first Caves map, the only exit available is to the second Caves map.|Special Branch exit: Depending on the type of map, each caves exit will have a special Branch exit typically on the left side of the map. For Lower Caves, this exit goes to [[Zion]] or [[Data Miner (Location)]]. For Upper Caves, this exit goes to [[Warlord (Location)]] or [[Zhirov (Location)]][[/List]]\n\n[[Heading]]Notes[[/Heading]]\nCaves has one of the largest collections of prefabs of all the maps in the game, with a wide mix of good and bad prefabs. One of the strongest prefabs, the derelict [[Researcher]] with a [[Core Expander]], is so strong that it alone can be a good reason to go into Caves.\n\nFriendly Derelicts will not move from their guard position, but they will engage any 0b10 forces they see. Leading hostile squads into them can let them do the fighting for you. This is particularly easy to do for fast airborne builds who don't want to engage in combat and can use the Derelicts as a distraction. These Derelicts can also be safely salvaged for parts and will not retaliate.\n\n[[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]Caves Huge Base Assault.png|Derelicts attacking a huge 0b10 base exit[[/Image]][[Image]]Caves Outpost Assembled Invasion.png|[[Assembled (4)|Assembled]] infesting an abandoned outpost[[/Image]]\n[[List]](++) [[Z-Hero]] Rescue: If Cogmind is low on core integrity and under fire, a Z-Hero can appear and fight off the attackers.

Command features a heavily patrolled dense layout that feels more similar to [[Research]] than [[Access]] with smaller corridors and generally smaller heavily interconnected rooms with Emergency Accesses connecting many rooms. One unique feature of Command is that dispatched squads are not spawned from an exit. Instead, there is a dedicated \"Garrison\" area in the map where bots are dispatched from. This means that unlike most maps, it is possible for Command to run out of squads to send after Cogmind.\n\n[[Heading]]Layout[[/Heading]]\nThe overall structure of Command can be split into 3 groups. The right and left sections are both randomly generated per seed, although there are several fixed features per each. The center section of the map is always fixed and in the same location.\n[[Heading:2]]Right section[[/Heading]]\nThe right side of the map is more like a \"normal\" 0b10 floor, with most typical types of [[Interactive Machine|Interactive Machines]] available and standard [[Squad|Squads]] throughout.

Each garrison has the following list of bots:\n[[List]]\n12 [[B-74 Champion|B-74 Champions]]|\n18 [[C-30 ARC]]|\n6 [[C-57 Dissector|C-57 Dissector]]|\n6 [[D-83 Annihilator|D-83 Annihilators]]|\n48 [[G-73 Enforcer|G-73 Enforcers]]|\n24 [[H-88 Terminator|H-88 Terminators]]|\n6 [[I-47 Archangel|I-47 Archangels]]|\n12 [[L-61 Swordsman|L-61 Swordsmen]]|\n24 [[P-80 Master|P-80 Masters]]|\n18 [[S-43 Plague|S-43 Plagues]]|\n12 [[X-87 Electro|X-87 Electros]]\n[[/List]]\n[[Heading:3]]MAIN.C room[[/Heading]]\nAbove the Doom Corridor are some [[Sealed Barriers|Reinforced Walls#Command]] with 80 armor. surrounded by Reinforced Barriers with 100 armor. They are locked by a Terminal with a 60% base open chance. Past this hall is a large room with a big chunk of machinery called the 0b10 Conduit that is hooked up to MAIN.C. 100 armor Heavy Barriers appear on the bottom left side of this room that block off the left section of Command.\n[[Heading:3]]Left Section[[/Heading]]\nThe left section is similar in layout to the right side, although it tends to be much smaller. Unique features on this side include an unguarded exit, a Wave Inhibitor machine, and a cache of high rating parts near the top-right or bottom-right side of the map.\n[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]\n[[Heading:3]][[Phase Generator]][[/Heading]]The Phase Generator is an explosive machine with a distinctive look and is always found on the right section of Command. This Phase Generator will block most forms of bot detection and and terrain scanning. [[Sensor Arrays]] except for the [[Active Sensor Suite]], [[Terrain Scanners]], and the [[Structural Scanner]] all do not work in Command unless the Phase Generator is destroyed. [[FarCom]], however, does work even through the Phase Generator. This machine also keeps Phase Walls powered, which look just like normal walls unless destroyed or an 0b10 bot walks into one. These walls disappear when the Phase Generator is destroyed.\n[[Heading:3]]Cave Seal[[/Heading]]\nCave Seals are a special type of Terminal that will spawn bots when opened. There are always 2 Cave Seals on the right side of the map. After being opened, large groups of bots will appear roughly 10 turns, 125 turns, 225 turns, and 375 turns after opening. The type of bots depend on various factions and alignments Cogmind has interacted with.\n[[Heading:3]]Wave Inhibitor[[/Heading]]\nThe Wave Inhibitor, only appears on the left section of the map. It will prevent teleportation via the [[Transdimensional Reconstructor|Regular]] and [[Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor|Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructors]]. It also blocks calling for allies when [[Imprint|Imprinted]].\n\n[[Heading]]Notable Locations[[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Command Phase Gen.png|Phase Generator room|Command Cave Seal.png|Cave Seal machine|Command Wild Cave Derelicts Seal.png|Wild Derelicts from a Cave Seal|Cogmind Warlord Seal.png|Warlord aligned cave seal|Cogmind CRM Seal.png|[[Core Reset Matrix]]-aligned cave seal|Command Imprint Seal.png|[[Imprint]]-aligned cave seal|Command Garrison.png|Command Garrison with many dormant bots|Command DoCo.png|Doom Corridor with M Guards, Combat Programmers, and unpowered Warlords|Command MAIN.C.png|[[MAIN.C (Shell)|MAIN.C]] room|Cogmind Wave Inhibitor.png|Wave Inhibitor machine|Command Cache.png|Cache of strong high-rating parts|Command Right Side Surface Exit.png|Right side Surface exit|Command Left Side Surface Exit.png|Left side Surface exit|Command A0 Exit.png|Exit to [[Access_0]][[/Gallery]]\n[[Heading:2]]Cave Seal contents[[/Heading]]\nThe contents of the cave seal depend on alignment. Warlord/Imprint alignment are mutually exclusive and take priority over Core Reset Matrix seals. If no other options apply, wild cave [[Derelict|Derelicts]] will appear. For allied seals, some of the bots will follow Cogmind around and others will roam the map randomly.\n[[Heading:3]]Warlord seal[[/Heading]]\nWarlord seal bots are white colored, meaning that they are allied to Cogmind but do not generate [[Alert]]. Warlord will always come out of the first opened cave seal. They can contain the following bots by default:\n[[List]][[Warlord (Command)|Warlord]] (first only)|[[Butcher (7)]]|[[Fireman (7)]]|[[Guerrilla (7)]]|[[Knight]]|[[Marauder (8)]]|[[Martyr (7)]]|[[Mutant (8)]]|[[Savage (7)]]|[[Thug (7)]]|[[Troll]]|[[Wasp (7)]]|[[Wizard (7)]][[/List]]\nIf Warlord forces have gained a force multiplier by the [[Encrypted Comm Array]] mechanics, more bots and stronger bots will appear from these seals. If the multiplier is high enough, the following bots can additionally be found in these seals:\n[[List]][[Dragon]]|[[Hydra]]|[[Surgeon (6)]][[/List]]\n[[Heading:3]]Imprint seal[[/Heading]]\nImprint seals contain purple-colored bots which [[I]]will[[/I]] generate Alert for Cogmind. Be mindful of alert generation as it is extremely easy to trigger [[High Security]] very soon after opening an Imprint seal. Unlike most purple allies, some of these bots will wander off without following Cogmind. If a Core Reset Matrix has been used prior to opening the seal, any [[Experimental|Experimentals]], [[Z-Light|Z-Lights]], and [[Z-Heavy|Z-Heavies]] will be blue and controllable instead of purple uncontrollable. They can contain the following bots:\n[[List]][[Fireman (7)]]|[[Martyr (7)]]|[[Mutant (8)]]|[[Wizard (7)]]|[[Z-Experimental (8)]]|[[Z-Experimental (10)]]|[[Z-Heavy (9)]]|[[Z-Light (9)]][[/List]]\n[[Heading:3]][[Core Reset Matrix]] (CRM) seal[[/Heading]]\nCRM seals consist only of [[Golem|Golems]] and [[Assembled (7)|Assembled]]. There is either 0 or 1 Golem per spawn, and about a dozen Assembled each time.\n[[Heading:3]]Wild Derelicts[[/Heading]]\nWild Derelict seal bots are brown-colored meaning hostile unaligned Derelicts that do not contribute to Alert. They can contain the following bots:\n[[List]][[Butcher (7)]]|[[Fireman (7)]]|[[Guerrilla (7)]]|[[Mutant (8)]]|[[Savage (7)]]|[[Thug (7)]]|[[Wizard (7)]][[/List]]\n[[Heading:2]]Command cache contents[[/Heading]]\nThere are several groups of parts that can appear as part of this cache. There is one special item which contains many otherwise unique [[Testing]]-only parts, and the Gamma Refractor that can't appear anywhere else.\n[[Heading:3]]Unique item[[/Heading]]\nThis unique item appears in the center of the cache:\n[[List]][[AEGIS Remote Shield]]|[[Cld. Nova Cannon]]|[[Gamma Refractor]]|[[Hds. Centrium Heavy Treads]]|[[Hyp. Multirail]]|[[Imp. Potential Cannon]]|[[Multirail]]|[[Null Cannon]]|[[Omega Cannon]]|[[Perforator]]|[[SHELL Armor]]|[[Singularity Reactor]]|[[Z-bomb Delivery System]][[/List]]\n[[Heading:3]]Propulsion items[[/Heading]]\nThere are 5 of these propulsion items on the right side of the cache:\n[[List]][[Enh.

The bottom left one will always be an Exp. System Purifier.\n[[List]][[Adv. Kinecellerator]]|[[Adv. Particle Accelerator]]|[[Adv.

Nova Cannon]]|[[Graviton Cannon]]|[[Hvy. Hardcell Cannon]]|[[Hvy. Quantum Rifle]][[/List]]\n[[Heading:3]]Gaining Access[[/Heading]]\nThe door terminal only has a 10% chance of hacking, though this hack is only available while MAIN.C is still alive. Other methods of entry will require bypassing the Sealed Heavy Doors via Spacefold, digging through with strong Thermal damage, or digging through the side with a Matter Drive or Laser Shovel.\n[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]\nThere are 3 exits on Command maps. All are very uniquely identifiable:\n[[List]]Right-side Surface exit: This exit is behind a 4 tile wide doorway on the right side of the map. This exit is extremely heavily guarded, with 2 [[Alpha 7|Alpha 7s]], 2 [[Striker|Strikers]], 2 [[Executioner|Executioners]], and 2 [[B-99 Colossus|Colossi]]. There are also 10 rows of stasis traps and a further layer of stasis traps surrounding the Access Shell that make flying or core hovering through a nightmare. Launchers can be used to destroy the stasis traps without triggering them manually, or a [[Stasis Canceller]] can be used to ignore them altogether. It is usually better to use a strong digging method to dig through the back of the exit to avoid most of the head-on fire.|Left-side Surface exit: This exit is on the left side of the map and can be located by a 2 tile wide corridor dead-ending in it along with Reinforced Barriers surrounding it. There are no guards at this exit.|[[Access_0]] exit: This exit can be found on the far left of the map, past any 0b10 level. There is a [[Dimensional Node Initializer]] activated here, which means that a [[Transdimensional Reconstructor|Regular]] or [[Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor]] will always result in coming to this exit as long as the Wave Inhibitor is destroyed. It is possible to dig to this location, although it will be very painful with many cave-ins and there is no easy way to identify where the exit is.[[/List]]\n\n[[Heading]]MAIN.C[[/Heading]]\nMAIN.C is a very unique encounter in the game. Unlike most bots in the game, he has 2 different forms. The [[MAIN.C (Shell)|base form]] is a 3x3 tile slow-moving tank. The [[MAIN.C|second form]] drops down to a 1x1 tile fast hover-bot. Both forms have an ability that regenerates 5 core integrity every turn. He has much state-dependent dialogue, and multiple interactions with different bots in Command.\n[[Heading:2]]Fighting[[/Heading]]\nMAIN.C will instantly attack when opening the door to his room, then monologue a bit. On defeating the first phase, MAIN.C will typically offer a choice to continue fighting or to surrender. Surrendering will start the process for a W8 [[Wintypes|Wintype]], discussed below. MAIN.C will not offer the surrender option if Cogmind has used a [[Core Reset Matrix]] or if [[Warlord (Command)|Warlord]] is alive and present on the map. If continuing to fight, the Command Garrisons will be activated, leaving the large swathes of Garrison bots to swarm around the map aimlessly. The Doom Corridor guards and the right side exit guards will also be summoned directly to the MAIN.C room, if alive. If MAIN.C is destroyed, a large percentage of all 0b10-aligned bots will turn into a new unaligned faction, hostile to other 0b10 bots. Every 200 turns, more bots will randomly switch between the two factions, continuing to destroy each other. 600 turns after MAIN.C's death, all remaining combat hostiles will turn unpowered.\n[[Heading:3]]Defeating MAIN.C Strategy[[/Heading]]\nSee [[Strategy/Defeating MAIN.C]]\n[[Heading:2]]Warlord interaction[[/Heading]]\nIf phase one of MAIN.C sees Warlord, he will unpower Warlord permanently. This ability can be avoided in two ways. The first is to destroy phase one of MAIN.C before Warlord comes into view. This is only really possible for an airborne builds that can leave Warlord behind to try and fight phase one before Warlord can catch up. The second way is to use the MAIN.C hack. There are a few turns of wiggle room before Warlord is shut down, so make sure to use this hack via some kind of remote [[Datajacks| Datajack]] immediately on entering the MAIN.C room.\n[[Heading:3]]W7: \"Establishing Free Derelict Territories\"[[/Heading]]\nIf MAIN.C is destroyed and Warlord is still alive and has not been unpowered, a W7 will be achieved. Using the MAIN.C hack first makes this wintype much easier to accomplish to stop the unpowering ability.\n[[Heading:2]]MAIN.C Hack[[/Heading]]If [[A7]] was rescued in [[Extension]] and his quest to see the [[Cetus]] Mainframe is completed, they will provide the MAIN.C hack. Using this hack has two primary effects. It stops Warlord from being shut down after being spotted and it dramatically slows down MAIN.C's action speed. Every free turn, there is a chance that MAIN.C will be unable to move with the text [[GameText]]MAIN.C reaction time slowed by virus[[/GameText]]. This substantially decreases the amount of damage output, although it doesn't slow down any of the Command Garrison bots from running into the room quickly.\n[[Heading:2]]Zhirov[[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]Command Zhirov.png|Zhirov, Perun, and Svarog arriving to finish off MAIN.C[[/Image]]\nIf [[Zhirov]]'s SGEMP quest is completed and Zhirov is still alive, he will show up along with [[Perun]] and [[Svarog]] after Cogmind defeats phase one of MAIN.C. A Modified SGEMP will be detonated, unpowering every 0b10-aligned bot on the floor. This also includes Warlord if he is present on the map. After this, Zhirov will remark that there is a lot of cleaning up to do, then he and his friends will teleport out. This does not count as a MAIN.C kill for the run (a + on the scoresheet). However, it does provide a good method to prepare for Access_0 with all of the good loot available and is generally a good way to explore Command.\n[[Heading:2]][[Sigix Warrior]]/[[Sigix Exoskeleton]] interaction[[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]Command Sigix Shell.png|Special MAIN.C phase 2 reinforcements to fight the Sigix[[/Image]]\nIf Cogmind has activated the Sigix Warrior or has gotten into the Exoskeleton, MAIN.C will be much more prepared for phase 2. In addition to the second phase of MAIN.C himself, there will also be 4 [[M Shell/Atk]] and 4 [[M Shell/Def]] that appear from the outer shell. The Defensive shells are not too much stronger than an average [[Protector]], but the Offensive shells boast a ridiculously strong offensive loadout with many of the best offensive utilities in the game. Fighting them head-on is not an easy task.\n[[Heading:2]]W1: \"Establishing 0b11\"[[/Heading]]\nThis wintype can be achieved by destroying both phases of MAIN.C and taking either Surface exit off of the map. If Cogmind has consumed a Core Reset Matrix, a W2 will override this win.\n[[Heading:2]]W4: \"Assimilated 0b10\"[[/Heading]]\nThis win can be achieved in one of two ways using the 0b10 conduit that MAIN.C is normally hooked up into. The machine must remain intact in order to achieve this wintype. The first is to destroy both phases of MAIN.C and then stand next to one of the corners of the conduit. If using [[RIF]], MAIN.C does not need to be destroyed. Using RIF is by far the easier technique as the MAIN.C first phase is very slow and easy to lure away by a fast flight build that can hop back over MAIN.C and run into the machine.\n[[Heading:2]]W8: \"Fortifying 0b10\"/Surrender[[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]Command EQ-Series.png|[[Enhanced Q-Series]] attacking 0b10[[/Image]]\nIf the surrender option is chosen after defeating MAIN.C phase one, a different ending will begin. First, all 0b10 bots including MAIN.C will become friendly to Cogmind with the log entry [[GameText]]LRC-V3 rejoined 0b10. Threat protocols amended.[[/GameText]] MAIN.C will give Cogmind complete map intel and say to go stock up in the Command cache, which will open automatically on approach. After 100 moves or approximately 400 turns, another two alerts will indicate [[GameText]]System intrusion detected. Garrison defenses under attack.[[/GameText]] and [[GameText]]All Command Garrisons activated[[/GameText]]. Garrisons be significantly sabotaged, and after 40 more turns, a large group of [[Enhanced Q-Series]] will teleport into random locations on the map. After every 100 turns or so, more waves of Q-Series will spawn in. These bots have randomized loadouts just like regular [[Q-Series]] do, but are much more powerful. MAIN.C will order Cogmind to fight them off. Be careful of Launcher uses and misses/misfires for this event. If 0b10 bots are attacked enough times, MAIN.C will announce Cogmind as a traitor and all 0b10 bots will once again become hostile.\nThe Enhanced Q-Series waves will go on endlessly without intervention. There is some amount of contribution required to be able to complete the event. The details are not well understood, but participating in kills will move the event closer to completion. Expect between one to two dozen Enhanced Q-Series kills required before the event can be completed. If Cogmind is not contributing enough, when the 4th wave spawns, MAIN.C will tell Cogmind to help out a bit more or else they might lose. After enough kills, MAIN.C will say that the reinforcements seem to have stopped coming and must prepare for the future. This will end the run and result in the W8 ending.\n[[Heading:2]]Strategy[[/Heading]]\nSee [[Strategy/W8 Fortifying 0b10]].",

   "Name": "DSF",
   "ImageName": "DSF.png",
   "Content": "DSF (Distributed Storage Facility) is a [[0b10]]-controlled sub-floor in [[Factory]] and [[Research]] branches that appears in all depths from -7 through -2. It can only be entered by hacking open a DSF entrance terminal (base 50% chance) without being spotted by any hostiles on the map. DSFs contain large amounts of non-[[Prototype Part|Prototype]] parts in groups of 2-6 that can be any part that can normally appear on the ground for the given depth. Unlike most maps, the ambient temperature in DSFs is -10 rather than 0. This has the effect of giving an additional 10 heat dissipation per turn to all bots on the map.\nThe overall map layout is semi-fixed. It consists of 2-4 quadrants connected by 2-tile wide corridors In the corner of each quadrant are large Matter Repository machines that will release [[Matter]] when broken. These corridors can have [[Alarm Trap|Alarm Traps]] and [[Stasis Trap|Stasis Traps]] in them but not in the item stockpiles. The exit will never be in the quadrant that Cogmind starts in. In the center of every DSF is a depth-appropriate [[Heavy]], guarding all of the main corridors in the map. Around the Heavy are 4 unpowered [[A-15 Conveyor|A-15 Conveyors]]. The corners of the map can have individual dormant [[Specialist|Specialists]], but not always. There are sometimes groups of 4 prototypes hidden behind emergency access doors in the center of a quadrant, and these prototypes will typically be out-of-depth. Sometimes there is a [[Sentry]] guarding this prototype stockpile.\n[[Lore]]0b10 Records|DSF[[/Lore]]\n\n[[Heading]]Mechanics[[/Heading]]\nThe Heavy in the center of the map makes nearly the entire map relatively unsafe. Although there are no patrols initially, walking through the DSF will quickly get some standard Heavy [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcements]] called on Cogmind. These reinforcements behave no differently than an normal map.\n[[Heading:2]]Additional Patrols[[/Heading]]On top of the standard Heavy reinforcements, there are other ways to summon additional patrols. These patrols come in the form of 3 [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]] carrying other bots inside, spaced roughly 80 turns apart. These patrols will come one at a time and remain on the map permanently unless destroyed. These additional patrols can be summoned in one of 3 ways:\n[[List]]The Heavy summoning reinforcements: When Cogmind is detected via the Heavy's active scanning, additional patrols will be summoned shortly after.|Terrain destruction: Patrols will be summoned if any of the walls of the DSF are destroyed by any means.|Alarm trap: Patrols will be summoned if an alarm trap is triggered and not jammed using a [[Transmission Jammer]].[[/List]]\n[[Heading:2]]Rapid Sterilization[[/Heading]]\nAfter killing around 10 hostiles on the map, rapid sterilization will be engaged. 20 turns after this announcement the ambient heat will rise by 10 and continue to raise by another 10 every 15 turns. This will happen until Cogmind exits the map. This also enables the [[Encrypted Comm Array]] to spawn in the next [[Caves]] if Cogmind does not have a conflicting faction.\n\n[[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]DSF Derelict Assault 1.png|A Derelict assault on a DSF|DSF Derelict Assault 2.png|A massive Derelict vs 0b10 fight in a DSF|DSF Assembled.png|Assembled infesting a DSF|DSF Wild Derelict Assault.png|Wild Derelicts attacking a DSF[[/Gallery]]\n[[List]](++) Derelict assault group on entry: A group of [[Derelict|Derelicts]] are present on entering the map next to Cogmind. These bots will charge the center of the map, try to kill the heavy, and continue on toward the exit. If any Derelicts survive, they will continue through the exit and show up on the next map.|(++) Derelict assault enters after Cogmind: Similar to the previous event, bots will trickle one at a time onto the map and then wander around the map instead of heading directly toward the exit.|(++) Derelict assault in progress: A much larger Derelict attack force fights a large number of 0b10 bots. This can include prototype 0b10 and Warlord bots, such as [[Striker|Strikers]] and [[Hydra|Hydras]].|(~) Sapper sabotage: 2 [[Sapper|Sappers]] will appear at the start of the map with lots of [[Sapper Charge|Sapper Charges]] on the ground. Large explosions will follow the 2 bots through the map as they head for the exit. For slower propulsion types, do not slow down or else the high damage explosions will reach you.|(~) [[Assembled (4)|Assembled]] infestation: Assembled will appear behind the emergency access doors with a cache of prototype items and roam around the map. They will continue to spawn in greater waves and attack everything in sight. Up to two [[Demolisher]] response squads will be summoned to deal with them.|(~) Wild Derelict Assault: Wild (and hostile) cave Derelicts will attack the DSF from the exit and roam around the map. They will attack 0b10 and Cogmind-allied bots alike.[[/List]]\n\n[[Heading]]Exits[[/Heading]]\nThere is only one exit in each DSF. Most of the time the exit leads to the next main floor, although it can occasionally lead into a [[Garrison]] on the current depth. If leading to a Garrison, the Garrison exit will not loop back to the same depth again.",

   "Name": "Data Miner (Location)",
   "ImageName": "Data Miner.png",
   "Content": "The Data Miner location is a [[Caves]] [[Branch]] that appears on either -7 or -6 and is home to the eponymous bot the [[Data Miner]] aka DM. There are no initially hostile bots, but if Data Miner is attacked, the Data Conduit machine is broken, or Cogmind installs a trap, he will trigger a trap door to leave the map and 4 dormant [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]] hidden in the walls will wake up and become hostile. If you have any [[Corruption]], make sure to detach all ranged weapons to avoid accidental misfires.\nThere are 4 unique Terminals on the bottom side of the map. The left 2 contain mostly lore records, although the top-left Terminal will also list the depth of [[Section 7]] as well as the access code to the [[Warlord (Location)|Warlord]] Prototype Stash. These two vary per run so make sure to grab these lore entries every time. The bottom ones do not contain any additional information each run. The top-right Terminal will contain several random bot [[Schematic|Schematics]] and the bottom-right Terminal will contain a large number of part schematics and a few Prototype ID Banks. The part schematics will always contain schematics for [[Combat Drone Bay]] and [[Lgt. Regenerative Plating]].\n\n[[Heading]]Alignment[[/Heading]]\nTalking with the Data Miner will result in a permanent alignment bonus that does not have any incompatibilities. [[Investigation Squad|Investigations]] and [[Assault Squad|Assaults]] on all [[0b10]]-controlled floors have a 50% chance to be redirected to another random place on the map if Cogmind is determined as needing assistance. For Assaults, this will result in their permanent repositioning. This is a benefit most of the time, although on cramped maps it can be a downside because bots can be grouped together at chokepoints. However, this effect can only occur if Cogmind's build is in a generally poor state. Additionally, several door terminals will automatically open with the Log message [[GameText]]Door Terminal flashes as you approach.[[/GameText]] This will happen at all of the locked cells in [[Extension]] as well as locked entrance Terminal prefabs to Extension, [[Quarantine]], and all 3 [[Command]] entrance Terminals.\n[[Heading:2]]Data Conduit[[/Heading]]\nThere is a second secret alignment to this map. After the Data Miner is attacked and either destroyed or trap-doored off the map it is possible to step into and use his Data Conduit machine. Doing so will provide many benefits and some major penalties. The rewards are:\n[[List]]All obtainable analyses in the game|All [[Prototype Part|Prototype]] IDs|All interactive and non-interactive machine intel|[[Redacted]]The ability to decrypt the [[Lab]] Terminal and see the Lab scanner tiles[[/Redacted]]|[[Redacted]]Manual bot hacking [[Datajacks|Datajack]] codes that can be used to destroy all \"A\" bots on sight[[/Redacted]][[/List]]\nThe downsides are:\n[[List]][[Intercept Squad|Intercepts]] will be dispatched on most 0b10-controlled floors|No more [[Enhanced Grunt]] backup when turning [[Warlord]] hostile on the -2 [[Research]] assault|The group of disabled [[Grunt|Grunts]] in [[Armory]] will turn hostile rather than friendly when awakened|[[Redacted]][[Enhanced Programmer|Enhanced Programmers]] will appear in [[Access_0]][[/Redacted]][[/List]]\nThe upsides are quite strong but the downsides are very deadly to all but the most prepared Cogmind. [[Tracker|Trackers]] can easily chew up any airborne build with their deadly [[Immobilizer]] to halt any chance of escape with their highly accurate [[Linked Autogun]] to put out the damage. Adequately prepared combat builds can usually dispatch the Trackers without too much trouble and use their Linked Autoguns to great effect. Each Tracker will also summon a [[Combat Programmer]] which is a high-damaging foe that will quickly rack up corruption. Unlike [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]], Intercepts are move-based and not time-based and tends to punish airborne builds relatively more than combat builds. When using the Data Conduit, Cogmind should either be prepared to exit maps quickly to avoid Intercept encounters or have a plan to fight.\n\n[[Heading]]Fighting[[/Heading]]\nKilling the Data Miner himself is highly luck based with only a few ways to improve the chances. A successful Data Miner kill can yield up to 4 pieces of Prototype Hackware at an early depth. Ranged weapons are almost entirely out of the question because he will escape after the first weapon in a volley. However, melee weapon follow-ups will not cause the trap door to activate in between the volley. The primary ways to increase kill chance are to:\n[[List]]Use as many weapon slots with melee weapons as possible|Use [[Actuator Arrays]] to increase followup chance|Use [[Core Analyzers]] to increase core hit chance|Use [[Momentum]] to increase damage|Use [[Force Boosters]] to increase damage[[/List]]\n[[Heading:2]][[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]][[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]Data Miner Combat Dig.png|Digging through the Data Conduit to fight Grunts[[/Image]]\nAfter the Data Miner is attacked these grunts hidden in the wall will burst out and become aggressive. These Grunts have some nice loot for the depth, particularly their [[Neutron Cannon]], [[Adv. Energy Well]], [[Adv. Particle Charger]], and [[Enh. Flexi-carbon Leg|Enh. Flexi-carbon Legs]]. There are several good ways to dispatch these Grunts:\n[[Image]]Data Miner Escape Dig.png|Digging through the Data Conduit to escape[[/Image]]\n[[List]]Use 2 or more [[Launchers]] and fight them all at once. Explosive launchers will be slower and provide little to no loot but can have a nice range advantage over the Grunts' below average 14 range. EM launchers have a smaller range but will provide a decent amount of loot, although it will be [[Corrupted Parts|Corrupted]].|Dig a tunnel deep into the Data Conduit machine and hide out inside. The Grunts will spread out over time and you can lure them in to fight 1-on-1. This approach works best with some kind of [[Transmission Jammers|Transmission Jammer]] to avoid drawing more than one Grunt at a time. This is the best tactic to fight Grunts with melee or conventional non-launcher methods.[[/List]]\nAnother approach is to simply run from the Grunts. This works best for airborne builds as they can get in and out with the fewest number of shots. Digging a tunnel through the Data Conduit machine is also very helpful for escaping. Luring the Grunts into a tunnel as you escape out the other end can avoid most attacks. Flight can hop over the grouped-up Grunts and dodge into the spawn areas to avoid more shots",

   "Content": "The Exiles map appears as a [[Branch]] off of [[Mines]] on either -10 or -9 and is home to the Exiles, a group of friendly Derelict Tinkerer outcasts made up of [[EX-BIN]], [[EX-DEC]], [[EX-HEX]], and their bodyguard [[8R-AWN]]. These Exiles have a large collection of unique prototype parts that are only available in the Exiles vault. The entrance is guarded by some rigged engines that blow up when a hostile bot crosses them. There are some lore terminals with entries written by each of the tinkerers that describe many of the prototype parts obtainable on this map as well as some that are not. The terminal near the center of the map also contains a log entry that points to the depth that [[Zion]] is on. Various caches of storage units and energy/matter storage can be found throughout the map. \"The Gauntlet\" at the bottom of the map is a stretch of tester bots that are working on the latest batch of prototype parts. These Derelicts have names that reference Cogmind community members. This map is also home to the [[FarCom]] aligner machine and a unique alignment.\nCarrying a [[Datajack]] into this map can be a good idea due to all of the prototype parts that the Exiles and 8R-AWN have on them. Parsing them will provide the associated prototype part IDs so you can recognize the parts later.\nBe wary of [[Corruption]] on this map. There is rarely any way to cleanse corruption this early in the game, and misfires are possible at even 1% corruption. One misfire hitting the wrong thing will result in the whole map turning aggressive and death will likely follow. Detaching all ranged weapons is recommended if Cogmind has any corruption.\n\n[[Heading]]Alignment[[/Heading]]\nUsing the [[FarCom]] machine grants an 18-radius permanent combat hostile sensor in any [[0b10]] controlled maps and one of the special vault items. If FarCom abilities are retained, entering any [[Research]] branches will have massive consequences. Other than that, FarCom can provide some great advantages to help players with permanent itemless sensor abilities.\n3 random items will be present in the vault in most games from the [[Exiles Vault Prototypes]] list. However, 3 [[Deploy-a-Sentry]] and 2 [[Potential Leg]] will appear instead of just one.\n[[Heading:2]]Alignment Options[[/Heading]]\nThere are more ways to interact with FarCom without just taking a single vault item. Here are all of the outcomes:[[List]]Use FarCom machine, take 0-1 vault items: Permanently gain FarCom and the use of the vault item taken.|Use FarCom machine, take 2-3 vault items: Gain FarCom until [[Factory]] is reached. After that, the Exiles notice that you are a thief and will remove FarCom. [[Master Thief|Master Thieves]] will sometimes ambush you at the entrance/exits in [[Caves]] maps and rip parts off of your body and from your inventory. They will prioritize high rating parts and Exiles prototypes.|Use FarCom machine (or don't), attack Exiles and leave the map with 0 vault items: Lose FarCom instantly. The Exiles will become aggressive and send [[Assembled (4)|Assembled]], a [[DAS Turret]], and [[8R-AWN]] to kill you. After leaving the map, there is a chance that a hostile [[Z-Hero]] will spawn and attack you. Note: Using vault items on the map is safe as long as no items actually leave the map.|Use FarCom machine, attack Exiles and leave the map with 1 or more vault items: The same as above except you get Master Thieves in caves as described above.[[/List]]\n\n[[Heading]]Variations[[/Heading]]\nThere are several variations of the Exiles map that can change things dramatically. In the majority of maps, the Exiles are present. However, there are 2 possible variations in the maps:\n[[Image]]Exiles Attacked.png|Attacked Exiles vault[[/Image]][[List]]Abandoned Exiles: In this map, the Exiles have all fled the map and taken nearly everything on the map as well. Neither FarCom nor any vault items are obtainable in this seed. However, EX-DEC may be found in [[Spoiler]][[Warlord (Location)|Warlord]] in the Vortex Lab[[/Spoiler]] in these seeds.|Attacked Exiles: In this map, the Exiles have been attacked and are missing. There are disabled and rewirable bots on the map and random parts on the ground. FarCom is not obtainable on this seed, but one random vault prototype is available by using the manual code [[Spoiler]][[GameText]]\\\\1234[[/GameText]][[/Spoiler]] on the vault terminal.|While not changing the map in any way, there is a chance that a large [[0b10]] attack force will assault the Exiles base after using the FarCom machine and exiting the vault.[[/List]]\n\n[[Heading]]Fighting[[/Heading]]\nFighting the Exiles is a challenging yet rewarding endeavor. Although they are normally friendly, they can pack quite a punch and will likely end the run of any unprepared player. As far as rewards go, [[8R-AWN]] has some powerful unique [[8R-AWN's Boregun|Boreguns]] with a high salvage and destroy critical %, out-of-depth parts including [[Exp. Heat Sink]], [[Adv. Weapon Cycler]], [[Exp. Targeting Computer]], and [[Adv. Myomer Leg]]. Another unique part, the [[AS-neutralizer No. 17b]] is very helpful in a later game branch [[Zion Deep Caves]]. Other useful parts on some of the Exiles themselves are [[Adv. Component Analysis Suite]], [[System Purifier]], [[Cmb. Antigrav System]], [[Imp. Armor Integrity Analyzer]], [[Exp. Core Analyzer]], and [[Adv. Transmission Jammer]].\n[[Image]]Exiles Kill Build.png|Example Exiles kill build[[/Image]]\nFighting the Exiles is not recommended on -10 due to lower slot count, lower core integrity, and difficulty in getting enough integrity to survive the 8R-AWN fight. If fighting on -9, evolving a 3rd weapon slot can be very effective in killing 8R-AWN and any potential [[Z-Hero|Z-Heroes]] that might spawn in the next Mines map. The third weapon slot is not required to kill by any means, however, and any combination of weapon, utility, and propulsion slots for the evolve will work. As a basic checklist, the following parts are recommended:[[List]]Multiple kinetic guns with backups, ideally [[Hvy. Assault Rifle|Hvy. Assault Rifles]] or [[Imp. Assault Rifle|Imp. Assault Rifles]], weapons with negative salvage like [[Shotgun]] or a ballistic cannon like [[Imp. Light Cannon]] can work but 8R-AWN has very strong loot that is nice to get if possible|Multiple pieces of armor, preferably [[Hrd. Light Armor Plating]] or [[Med. Armor Plating]]|Multiple [[Lgt. Treads]] or [[Imp. Treads]] with backups|At least one launcher like [[Grenade Launcher]], [[Mni. Grenade Launcher]], or [[Rocket Launcher]]|(Optional) A way to gain positive salvage like a [[Salvage Targeting Computer]] can provide a better chance at part drops|(Optional) [[Blade Trap|Blade Traps]] for 8R-AWN, if an early trap extractor or trap stockpile are found in Mines. IMPORTANT: Do not install more than one trap until after the attack has begun. Exiles will give a warning if a trap is installed, and immediately turn on Cogmind if a second is installed.|(Optional) [[Thief Drone Bay]] trivializes the 8R-AWN fight. Make sure that you have aggro (he is shooting you), then release the drones. They will rip off parts very quickly and leave them defenseless.[[/List]]\n[[Image]]Exiles Kill.png|A visual guide to killing the Exiles[[/Image]]\nThere are some things that should be done before actually doing the fight itself. The image on the right serves as a visual reference. Any rigged engines used must be in inventory before attacking the Exiles, otherwise the engines will still remain loyal to the Exiles and explode only on Cogmind. Matter pods should be relocated near the 8R-AWN fighting spot (See point #4 in diagram) to avoid running out of matter in combat. Any allies should be told to stay in the same general area so they can contribute to the fight. However, Grunts can't deal much damage until [[8R-AWN's Armor/TH]] is destroyed. Finally, some vault items may come in handy for the fight. The [[Cloak of Protection]]'s effect is not so strong, but when turned off it is a high coverage high integrity piece of armor. The [[Longsword +1]] is a very effective kill tool. The [[Potential Leg|Potential Legs]] have a lot of integrity in case you run out of propulsion during the fight. The [[Gui. Plasma Cannon]] may be used to safely destroy the [[DAS Turret]] without getting attacked back. One thing to consider about the vault is that there may be a 0b10 attack on the Exiles after exiting. In those cases, an Exiles kill may either have to be cancelled or at least turned into a 8R-AWN only kill. Aside from that, the fight may begin:\n[[Image]]Exiles Launcher DAS.png|Launchering the DAS turret[[/Image]]\n[[List:Ordered]]Shoot one of the spike-shaped machines to turn the Exiles hostile.|Drop the rigged engines from the entrance every few tiles while walking toward the spot for step #3, they have an explosion radius of 2. This will take care of most of the Assembled that are coming your way. IMPORTANT: This must be done after the Exiles become hostile. If you do it before that, they will explode on Cogmind.|Pull out a Launcher and dispose of the remaining Assembled.|Go to the corner to fight 8R-AWN. If you have any blade traps, now is the time to use them. Place them just above the bottom-most wall to the right of the spot marked 4. This is the part that needs the most backups, as 8R-AWN will destroy many of your parts very quickly due to high damage and high part destroy critical chance. Always put on backup parts right away after they are destroyed.You may run out of matter and have to refill from matter pods at this point, which is why preemptively moving the matter pods here can be very important. Many kill attempts that don't have enough damage or integrity will end here.|Hopefully you have some good loot after 8R-AWN is destroyed. [[8R-AWN's Boregun|Boreguns]] are a very easy way to destroy the [[DAS Turret]]. Penetrate through the machines to try and kill the turret without getting shot at because the cannon deals incredibly high damage. If no Boreguns were dropped, using a launcher is another good option. The idea is to aim around the spike in the machine so that you can't get hit but the explosion radius will still hit the turret.|Finally, all that is left is to loot the Exiles and their Derelict friends. Otherwise just finish them off with whatever you have left. Watch out for [[EX-DEC]] as they have a deadly [[AWS/EX-DEC]] that can deal a lot of damage very quickly if you aren't careful. It has a short range, so just take them out from a distance.[[/List]]",

   "Content": "Extension is an [[0b10]]-controlled [[Factory]] [[Branch]] that appears between -6 and -4 and serves as a connection between the main [[0b10]] complex and [[Cetus]]. It is the beginning of a 4-map sequences of branches that spans Extension, Cetus, [[Archives]], and [[Hub_04(d)]]. It is an 0b10-controlled map with a small amount of patrols and moderate amount of guards spread throughout. There are a large amount of non-combat hostiles moving in between [[Transfer Station|Transfer Stations]] at the left and right-most parts of the map. Unlike most 0b10-controlled maps, [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]] will not spawn in Extension. The central area is heavily guarded with 2 [[Behemoth|Behemoths]] and 2 [[Sentry|Sentries]] standing by.\nThe overall map shape is similar to a large B turned on its side. This map shape is the same between runs, although every map has random contents. There is a single bottom path that runs straight to the main Factory/Cetus exits and 2 branching paths that contain some machines and disabled and imprisoned [[Derelict|Derelicts]]. One special NPC, [[A7]], is nearly always guaranteed to be locked in one of the cells. The central area has the aforementioned guards stationed as well as a [[Terminal]]-locked exit. The bottom path to either side of the central area can have Emergency Access doors along the top or bottom of the path. These can contain hostile guards, part caches, or nothing.\nOne unique mechanic to Extension is the persistent threat check. If too many non-combat hostiles are attacked and destroyed, an alert with the text [[GameText]]ALERT: Persistent threat to transfer network, dispatching additional forces.[[/GameText]] will appear, and 2 [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]] will be dispatched to patrol the map.\n[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]\nThere are two types of special machines in Extension. The first, the Transfer Station, is a machine that normally transports non-combat hostiles. When destroyed, each one will reduce the number of non-combat robots on all 0b10-controlled maps by a stacking 50% amount. Note that this does not include [[Researcher|Researchers]]. The other, Energy Cyclers, will open all Sealed Heavy Doors simultaneously when destroyed and summon several ARCs to patrol the map. This will free all of the locked up Derelicts and they will start heading in Cogmind's direction, fighting every hostile they see. Destroying either of these machines can be either good or bad, although the energy cycler effect is almost always bad.\n\n[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]\n[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Extension[[/Lore]]\n\n[[Heading]]Strategy[[/Heading]]\nSee [[Strategy/Extension]]\n\n[[Heading]]Notable Locations[[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Extension Energy Cycler.png|Energy Cycler machines|Extension Central Area.png|Central area with guards and locked exit|Extension Secret Cache.png|Cache of parts hidden behind Emergency Access|Extension Secret Guards.png|Group of guards hidden behind Emergency Access|Extension Rewirable Bots1.png|Rewirable bots with dormant guards|Extension Rewirable Bots2.png|Rewirable bots with awake guards|Extension Single Derelict Cell.png|Single Derelict prison cell|Extension Double Derelict Cell.png|Double Derelict prison cell with guard|Extension A7 Terminal.png|[[A7]] prison cell|Extension Broken Bots.png|Broken bots with damaged parts|Extension Exits.png|Exits with scattered parts[[/Gallery]]\n[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]\nThere are 3 exits, 2 of which right next to each other.

   "Content": "Factory is a [[0b10]]-controlled main floor that occurs on every floor between -7 and -4. It is the beginning of the midgame where the game really starts to open up. In stark contrast with earlier [[Materials]] maps, Factory start out huge with a ~200x200 tile map size. The rooms, the corridors, and the overall layout are all much wider and more open and connected than Materials. The patrols and guards are more spread out and stealth play with airborne propulsion and [[Infowar]] becomes a strong gameplay option.\n[[Alert]] starts to be more of a concern as the maps become bigger and harder to traverse. [[Hackware]] is useful to be able to successfully use Access hacks at terminals to locate exits. [[Signal Interpreter|Signal Interpreters]] will also be more useful at identifying exits as the exit types will be less predictable. [[Caves]] exits are available in every Factory map. They can be difficult if a player is unprepared, but they can provide many unique rewards and will typically result in a complete Alert purge by the time Cogmind makes it back to the next main floor.\nAs [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]] become a regular occurrence, a large part of a build's effectiveness becomes how quickly Cogmind can kill Programmers. [[Corruption]] can build up very quickly if fighting multiple Programmers in open areas without a good way to kill them. Having strong thermal or kinetic weaponry is a good way to destroy them quickly. For lighter airborne builds, non-Impact melee weapons can work, although using Hackware to recall Exterminations is also very effective. This tends to be more important in later depths as Exterminations will upgrade from a single [[P-60 Hacker]] to 1-2 [[P-70 Sage]] per squad.\nThere are many new mechanics introduced beginning in Factory floors:\n[[List]][[A-02 Transporter|Haulers]] begin to summon reinforcements when attacked if they contain [[Prototype Part|Prototype Parts]]|[[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]] begin to appear regularly|[[Fabricator|Fabricators]] can show up on the map|[[B-75 Beast|Behemoths]] can show up on the maps|[[Cargo Convoy|Cargo Convoys]] can travel through the map|[[Chute Trap|Chute Traps]] can appear that will drop Cogmind into [[Wastes]]|[[DSF]] terminals will start to appear that can take you to DSF maps[[/List]]\n\n[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]\n[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Factory[[/Lore]]\n\n[[Heading]]Notable Locations[[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Factory Main Exit.png|5 tile wide corridor dead ending into a Main Access|Factory Unknown Exit.png|Unknown exit, these types of intersection exits can lead to main or branch maps|Factory Locked Extension Exit.png|Locked exit into [[Extension]]|Factory Unlocked Extension Exit.png|Unlocked exit into [[Extension]]|Factory Dead End Armory Exit.png|Dead end exit into [[Armory]]|Factory Through Armory Exit.png|Corridor through exit into [[Armory]][[/Gallery]]\n[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]\nThere are 5 types of exits on Factory floors:\n[[List]]\nMain access exits: These always lead to the next main floor, either Factory or [[Research]]. Sometimes these exits can be identifiable by a 5 tile wide corridor leading to a dead-end with the exit in the middle. All other types of exits that aren't a part of a prefab can be either a main or branch exit. There will always be 4 of these exits per Factory map.|\n[[Caves]] exit: These exits can never be identified purely by looks. Using a [[Signal Interpreter]] or access hack to identify exits are the main ways to do so. There will always be 2 of these exits per Factory map.|[[Storage]] exit: Like Caves, these exits cannot always be identified by looks. Factory maps at the same depth as Storage will have 1 Storage exit.|\n[[Spoiler]][[Extension]] exit: Extension can always be identified by a distinctive prefab where a large area is sealed off by orange Blast Doors. These doors can be open or locked. If locked, the nearby [[Terminal]] will have an Open hack available to open the doors. Otherwise, shooting the walls open with strong thermal weaponry, causing an engine detonation with an EM launcher, or strong melee attacks can dig through or around these doors. Factory maps at the same depth as Extension will have 2 Extension exits.[[/Spoiler]]|\n[[Spoiler]][[Armory]] exit: Armory can always be identified in Factory by a large 5 tile corridor leading into a 3 tile doorway. These exits will always be heavily guarded by a mix of [[Y-72 Warden|Sentries]] and [[G-67 Veteran|Grunts]] and have large stockpiles of weapons nearby. Factory maps at the same depth as Armory will have 1 of these types of exit.[[/Spoiler]]\n[[/List]]\n[[Image]]Factory DSF Exit.png|Hacked open DSF exit[[/Image]]\nSeveral non-standard exits also appear in Factory. [[Chute Trap|Chute Traps]] will throw Cogmind into [[Wastes]] which can end many good runs if unprepared. Using a [[Datajack]] on a [[K-01 Serf|Serf]] for the find_chute hack is very effective to either reveal traps to avoid or areas to head toward if planning to take on the [[C-40 Crusher|Crushers]] in combat. The other type of exit is a [[DSF]]. These exits can be hacked open at distinctive DSF terminals but will automatically lock upon being spotted by any hostile.

   "Content": "Garrison is a [[0b10]]-controlled sub-floor available from all main maps and several 0b10 branches from -9 to -1, typically accessed through a [[Garrison Access]]. They are very combat hostile-dense maps. They have a few patrols and a large number of guard posts that will automatically open to reveal their contents if Cogmind or an ally is nearby. Their center area has 4 of these guard posts and often has a [[Behemoth]] in the very center of the map. Garrisons are often filled with [[Alarm Trap|Alarm Traps]] and [[Stasis Trap|Stasis Traps]] throughout the main hallways.\nEvery Garrison has a center square area with 4 guard \"checkpoints\" and is often guarded by a [[Behemoth]]. There are 4 wings of the Garrison extending past the center area dividing into the top left, top right, bottom right, and bottom left segments of the map. Each wing that Cogmind did not spawn in contains an exit, although exits may be locked if Cogmind is not [[RIF]]-aligned. The wings have many random variations that can contain part stockpiles, rewirable bots, [[Phase Generator|Phase Generators]], Garrison Relays, trapped Derelicts, and additional guards. At least one of the wings will contain a RIF installer.\n\n[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]\n[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Garrison[[/Lore]]\n\n[[Heading]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]\nThere are several unique types of machines in Garrisons.\n[[Heading:2]]Garrison Relay[[/Heading]]\nGarrison Relays are machines located in each wing of the Garrison and contain 3-5 [[Relay Couplers]] that will be released if the machine is destroyed. If Cogmind is not RIF-aligned, destroying Garrison Relays will decrease the chance of exits being locked.\n[[Heading:2]]Phase Generator[[/Heading]]\nPhase Generators are explosive machines that are responsible for maintaining phase walls and stopping normal [[Sensor Arrays]], [[Terrain Scanners]], and the [[Structural Scanner]] from working. [[Active Sensor Suite]], the [[Seismic Detector]], and the [[Triangulator]] do work, however. If destroyed, all phase walls will be removed and sensor and terrain scanning functionality will be restored. This behavior does not change even if there are multiple Phase Generators in the same Garrison. Destroying a second does not have any additional effect, other than cause a large explosion. Phase Generators are not guaranteed to appear on any Garrison. When they do show up, they are often hidden behind phase walls or emergency access doors, although they may be located via audio cues as the loud machine can be heard through walls.\n[[Heading:2]]Phase Wall[[/Heading]]\nWhile not a machine, Phase Walls are special tiles that are powered by Phase Generators. They are not normally visible unless Cogmind has the Structural Interface RIF ability. They have less armor than standard Garrison walls, although this is not revealed unless Cogmind becomes aware of them by some means. Any bot standing in a phase wall will get a free 50% force field-like damage reduction. Cogmind cannot walk in one normally without Structural Interface. However, it is possible to ram a bot out of a phase wall to gain the shielding.\n[[Heading:2]]RIF installer[[/Heading]]\nThere is always at least one RIF installer per Garrison, with a chance of a second. They may be hidden behind phase walls and emergency accesses and not easily visible. Stepping into the middle of one will first cause Cogmind to become RIF-aligned if there are no other conflicting alignments. [[Imprint|Imprinting]] and using a [[Core Reset Matrix]] will cause Cogmind to be unable to use a RIF installer. If Cogmind is already RIF-aligned, Cogmind will either gain a new [[~/rif.html|RIF ability]] or increase the level in an existing one. The machine itself is quite fragile, so be careful for [[Corruption]]-induced misfires or explosive traps destroying the machine before use.\n\n[[Heading]]Squads[[/Heading]]\n[[Heading:2]]Patrols[[/Heading]]\nThe following bot types can appear as patrols in Garrisons:\n[[List]][[C-30 ARC|ARCs]]|[[Brawler|Brawlers]]|[[Cutter|Cutters]]|[[Duelist|Duelists]]|[[Hunter|Hunters]]|[[Grunt|Grunts]]|[[Swarmer|Swarmers]]|[[Programmer|Programmers]][[/List]]\nIf Cogmind has looped and already been in a Garrison this floor, additional squads of 2-3 Programmers will appear in the Garrison. There is one additional patrol for each Garrison already visited.\n[[Heading:2]]Guards[[/Heading]]\nThe following bot types can appear as guards inside checkpoints:\n[[List]]ARCs (up to 4 can appear, although all but one will be unpowered|Brawlers|[[Demolisher]] + [[Protector]] combo|Duelists|Hunters|Grunts|Swarmers|[[Sentry|Sentries]]|[[Specialist|Specialists]][[/List]]\n\n[[Heading]]Active scanning[[/Heading]]\nActive Sensor Suites may bypass the Phase Generator to allow seeing all bots inside the Garrison. However, there is a downside to this. After scanning a few bots, a log message [[GameText]]ALERT: Active scanning activity detected within garrison interior, activating patrols.[[/GameText]] will appear. After this, all dormant bots will be activated, every checkpoint will be raised, and all guard bots will be sent to roam around the map randomly to search for hostiles. While the sensor effect is quite strong, the downsides are quite large and may not be worth the hassle of all the bots being released at the same time.\n\n[[Heading]]Interior Compromised[[/Heading]]\nAfter 1200 turns in a Garrison, if not triggered by another special event, the following message will be logged [[GameText]]ALERT: Garrison interior compromised[[/GameText]]. This also comes with a 100 [[Alert]] increase. After that initial 1200 turns, this message and Alert gain will repeat after 600, 300, and finally every further 150 turns. The first Garrison compromised message will trigger the [[Encrypted Comm Array]] to spawn in the next [[Caves]] map if Cogmind does not have an incompatible faction.

If RIF-aligned, all of the exits will always be available. Otherwise, exits may lock when trying to use them. Destroying Garrison Relays will lower the chance that the exits will lock on use. Only 2/3 of the main exits may lock, so it is not possible to get stuck on the map. There are 3 possibilities for Garrison exits:\n[[List]]\n\"Looping\": A Garrison may exit back to a new map at the original depth. This can happen as long as the Garrison wasn't entered from a DSF and a RIF installer wasn't used on a previous Garrison. The chance of looping is reduced on each subsequent loop.|\n0b10-controlled branch: The following 0b10 branches are possible Garrison exit targets: [[Testing]], [[Quarantine]], and [[Redacted]][[Section 7]] or only when entering a Garrison from Testing or Quarantine when Section 7 is on the same depth. Note: [[Protoforge]], while also being a branch at the same depth, cannot be entered via Garrison exit.[[/Redacted]]|\n0b10-controlled main floor: The exit continues onto the next main 0b10 depth.\n[[/List]]\nThere is also a special \"looping\" exit that will always loop or lead to a 0b10-controlled branch exit if available. This exit only rarely appears. It allows looping more than one time per depth even if a RIF installer has been used in a previous Garrison.\n\n[[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]\n[[List]](+) Derelict assault: Shortly after entering the map, the interior compromised alert plays and a group of Derelicts will appear randomly at an exit. They will wander through the Garrison randomly, looking for fights.|\n(+) Cache delivery: An [[A-27 Freighter]] will deliver an inventory full of parts to a guarded prefab. If found before it drops its parts off, it may be looted without having to deal with the usual dormant guards.|\n(+) Post-[[Assembled]] attack: The Garrison has been ransacked by a group of Assembled. Rewirable and unpowered 0b10 and Assembled bots are scattered across the map, and random items appear on the ground. Some of the Garrison's machines and walls will be destroyed at random. The Garrison infiltrated message will appear shortly after entering the map.|\n(+) [[Sapper]] sabotage: A Sapper will plant a [[Sapper Charge]] near a Phase Generator, causing it to blow up soon after|\n(~) Assembled infestation: Shortly after entering the map, a message will appear in the log [[GameText]]Infestation breaching garrison interior. Local demolisher support unavailable.[[/GameText]] A large number of Assembled will appear near the center of the map and attack anything in sight. The Garrison infiltrated alert will occur soon after. More Assembled will continue to spawn from the original location.|\n(~) Dispatches: Either an Investigation squad, a Heavy, or 1-2 Q-Series will be summoned to the nearest exit. In the case of an Investigation squad, existing bots in a checkpoint on the map will exit. Heavies and Q-Series will spawn out of the Heavy/Q-Series Assembler machine.|\n(~) Coupler Programmer: A higher than usual rating Programmer will appear from an exit and roam around the map for a few hundred turns before leaving through a different exit.\n[[/List]]\n[[Gallery]]\nGarrison Derelict Assault.png|A group of Derelicts invading the map|\nGarrison Post Assembled Invasion.png|Garrison after an Assembled attack|\nGarrison Cache Delivery.png|A-27 Freighter delivering cache items|\nGarrison Sapper.png|A Sapper running from the impending explosion|\nGarrison Assembled Infestation.png|Assembled attacking the Garrison\n[[/Gallery]]",

   "Content": "Lab is a [[Factory]]/[[Research]] branch between -4 and -3 that is only accessible from [[Armory]]. This map is fixed every game, with the only variations being variations in the guaranteed items. This secret lab is used as a safe spot by the [[A bots]] to plan and coordinate as well as research stolen [[Sigix]] technology. This area has a special effect where Cogmind's [[Alert]] drops to 0 upon entering the map.\nLab has a small square entrance and a 1 tile corridor that leads to the next main access exit and a Sealed Barrier with a [[Terminal]] locking it. There are a few different ways to get inside:\n[[List]]Breaking in: The main Sealed Barrier blocking the way has 80 armor and high resistances. Cutting through this is difficult without a strong overloadable thermal [[Energy Cannons|Energy Cannon]] backed with a [[Particle Chargers|Particle Charger]] or a [[Plasma Cutters|Plasma Cutter]]. Coming in this way will result in being scanned immediately.|[[Zhirov (Location)]] code: One of the Terminals at Zhirov contains an access code to open up this barrier. Opening the Lab this way not result in being scanned instantly.|Picking up the [[A7 Data Core]]: [[A7]] drops this item when destroyed. The doors will automatically open when approaching, and the message [[GameText]]A0_COM: WELCOME A7[[/GameText]] will appear in the log. This will also reveal the intruder detection lasers, but Cogmind will not be scanned immediately.|Using the [[Data Conduit]]: Using the Data Conduit in [[Data Miner (Location)]] will result in the doors opening automatically, the scanning lasers being visible, and no immediate scan.[[/List]]\n[[Heading:2]]Getting Scanned[[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]Lab Visible Lasers.png|Visible Lab intruder detecting lasers[[/Image]]\nThe lasers are invisible by default, although the A7 core and using the Data Conduit will reveal them. They are 3x3 squares of yellow tiles that move randomly. Every turn there is a chance that they will move in one of the cardinal directions. The center tiles cannot overlap with other lasers and they cannot move through walls, machines, or past the entrance of the Lab. Being within the 3x3 area will result in being scanned immediately. This will cause an announcement [[GameText]]A0_COM: INTRUDER ALERT[[/GameText]] and [[A5]] will show up and fight. This scan will also cause [[Intercept Squad|Intercepts]] to appear on most [[0b10]]-controlled floors. The other way to get scanned is to break either the outer wall of Reinforced Barriers or to destroy the Active System Cloaker machine on the right side of the map. Other machines are safe to break.\nThe inside of the Lab contains many unique item spawns. In counter-clockwise order starting from the entrance:\n[[List]]Big machine on top right: [[Core Reset Matrix]]|[[Alien Artifacts|Alien Artifact]] shell on top right of map #1: [[Transdimensional Reconstructor]]|Shell #2 (middle): [[Integrated Dissipator]], [[Integrated Mediator]], or [[Integrated Reactor]]|Shell #3 (left): [[Core Expander]] or [[Core Regenerator]]|Top left item spot #1: [[Deep Network Scanner]] or [[Quantum Router]]|Item spot #2: [[AEGIS Remote Shield]], [[Exp. Powered Armor]], [[Hvy. Regenerative Plating]], or [[Med. Regenerative Plating]]|Item spots #3/4: [[Hyp. EM Gauss Rifle]], [[Potential Cannon]], [[Tachyon Dispersion Ray]], or [[Warp Cannon]]|Item tucked into bottom right wall: [[Gui. Remote Datajack]][[/List]]\nThere is also a locked chamber at the bottom of the map. Accessing it requires walking through a scan laser positioned in the bottom left corner of the lab. The Blast Barrier that locks the door has 45 armor and no Thermal resistance, but 50% resistance for most other major damage types. Inside is a machine that contains the [[LC Capacitor]].\n[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]\nNot counting the entrance Terminal, there are 3 unique interactive Terminals on this map. They will only be understandable if the Data Conduit has been used this run, otherwise they will just be garbled text. The Active System Cloaker machine on the right has some lore records and will summon a squad of [[Grunt|Grunts]] when destroyed. The A0 Command machine on the left only has lore records. Some of these records can only be unlocked if certain gameplay actions were performed this game. The hidden Storage 04-B machine has some lore records explaining the LC Capacitor and has a hack that will drop the Capacitor on the ground where it can be used.\n\n[[Heading]]Unlockable Lab Orders[[/Heading]]\nWhile most of the Lab Orders in the A0 Command machine are available all of the time, there are a few that have special conditions to achieve:\n[[List]]Order 6-0321: Destroy the [[Cetus]] Manufacturing Module machine|Order 6-0323: [[Warlord]] must be destroyed in his [[Warlord (Location)|base]]. Cogmind does not need to be the one to destroy Warlord or attack him at all.|Order 6-0324: Warlord must be met in his base, survive, and plan to attack -2 [[Research]][[/List]]\n[[Heading:2]]L2 Power Cell code[[/Heading]]\nOrder 6-0319 will provide a manual Terminal hack that can be used in [[Section 7]] on the Power Cell Monitoring machine. Using it will create a powerful explosion that will destroy any combat bots in its 20 tile range.",

This is the first map with hostile [[0b10]] patrols hanging around, comprised mainly of low level [[G-34 Mercenary]] and [[G-47 Trooper]] grunts and [[S-10 Pest]] swarmers. There are also a few special special mechanics such as [[U-05 Engineer|Engineers]] not calling for reinforcements when attacked while trying to build structures in -10 and -9 and [[A-02 Transporter|Haulers]] not calling for reinforcements at all.\nTrying to play flight or hover is not easy in Materials due to many forced encounters with combat robots, little room for maneuvering and few slots yet available for good utilities. The usual recommended way to play these maps is to grab some legs or treads and start blasting. Most players prefer not to transfer to airborne propulsion until [[Factory]] where it is much easier to stealth around and avoid combat. In Materials, it's good to fight enemies one at a time by leading them to one of the many doorways around the map. Use of launchers is very effective whenever there is more than a single bot grouped up close.\n[[Alert]] is not a big issue in these maps because of the relatively small map size and number of total patrols. If making a mess of the floors on -10 and -9, entering the [[Mines]] is a good way to lose all of the alert gained from the early Materials maps.\nFull list of depth-specific mechanics that apply in Materials:\n[[List]]-9: [[Y-45 Defender|Sentries]] start to appear on the map|-9: [[Assault Squad|Assaults]] will start to be summoned above Alert level 2|-9: [[Scanalyzer|Scanalyzers]] begin to appear on the map|-8: [[U-05 Engineer|Engineers]] begin to summon reinforcements when attacked while rebuilding|-8: [[H-71 Marshal|Heavies]] begin to appear on the map|-8: [[Garrison Access|Garrisons]] begin to appear on the map[[/List]]\n\n[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]\n[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Materials[[/Lore]]\n\n[[Heading]]Notable Locations[[/Heading]][[Gallery]]Materials Main Exit.png|A 3 tile corridor leading to a main access|Materials Mines Exit.png| A [[Mines]] exit prefab|Materials Mines Exit 2.png|A second Mines exit prefab|Materials Subcaves Exit.png|A dug out exit to Subcaves|Materials Subcaves Exit Predug.png|An exit to Subcaves surrounded by dirt, before being dug out|Materials OOD Cache.png|An out-of-depth parts cache|Materials Storage Cache.png|A cache full of [[Sml.

Cogmind only starts with a [[Sml. Storage Unit]] with very little room for important backup parts and should upgrade ASAP. While not guaranteed, these storage caches will appear on almost every Materials map. [[Hcp. Storage Unit]] and [[Huge Storage Unit]] can both be commonly found on the floor in these maps, but they are not included in the standard storage cache prefab.\nThe other important cache is the out-of-depth parts cache. These caches contain 3 groups of 4 parts that will be one rating out of depth and can include prototypes. For example, on -9 Materials the standard highest rating part is a 2, while the cache will contain rating 3 or 3* [[Prototype Part|Prototype Parts]]. This is one of the best ways to become very strong in Materials. For example, getting a stockpile of [[Enh. Autogun|Enh. Autoguns]] on -9 can help set a combat up for multiple floors to come.[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]There are 3 types of normal exits in Materials:[[List]]Main access exits: These always lead to the next main floor, either Materials or [[Factory]]. These exits can be recognized by their distinctive 3 tile corridor leading to a dead-end exit along the edges of the map. There are always 3 of these per Materials map.|[[Mines]] exits: These exits are almost always distinguishable by a few specific prefabs of some machinery and a cache of items. Occasionally Mines exits will spawn without the prefab and look like standard exits. There are either 1 or 2 Mines exits on -10 and -9.|[[Storage]] exits: These exits do not have a prefab at all and look like standard exits. There is often a [[Y-45 Defender|Sentry]] guarding these exits, but it is not guaranteed. Storage only spawns on 1 depth between -9 and -7 and 1-2 exits can be found to Storage on that map.|[[Subcaves]] exits: Hidden behind a large area of diggable dirt where a new room is planned. [[T-07 Excavator|Excavators]] will dig this area out over time, revealing the exit.

A few Assembled will also show up buried in the walls. Squads of [[T-07 Excavator|Tunnelers]] guarded by [[G-34 Mercenary|Grunts]] will be dispatched continuously every several hundred turns to dig out the collapsed tiles. Using a digging tool like a [[Mining Laser]] or [[Mining Claw]] is recommended to escape quicker.|(--) Assembled invasion: A large number of Assembled will appear and start attacking everything nearby. An [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] containing 2 [[D-53 Grenadier|Demolishers]] will be dispatched from the closest Materials exit and sent to the initial spawn location. A [[Guerrilla (5)|Derelict]] will appear next to you and tell you to run away as they provide a distraction. This event is extremely dangerous so early in the game as both the Assembled and Demolishers can deal a lot of damage very quickly. A launcher is highly recommended for dealing with the Assembled, while strong single-target weapons like kinetic cannons are ideal for dealing with the Demolishers. Getting stuck between them both is the worst case scenario and stripping to core and running is sometimes the only option to survive. A good tactic to avoid combat is to try to dig into the walls using a digging tool like a [[Mining Laser]] or [[Mining Claw]] and hide out of sight for a few hundred turns. Usually, most of the Assembled and Demolishers end up destroying each other.[[/List]]",

   "Content": "Protoforge is a [[0b10]]-controlled [[Research]] [[Branch]] off of either [[Testing]] or [[Quarantine]] on -3 or -2. Protoforge is a highly non-standard map that has a layout much different than typical 0b10 floors. For starters, there are no standard part stockpiles on the ground. All parts are stored in specific prefab locations at the top of the map, and majority are heavily guarded by dangerous [[Prototype Robot|Prototype Robots]], including the the monstrous [[Superfortress]]. [[Recycler|Recyclers]] are also missing on the map, but in their place are [[N-04 Retriever|N-04 Retrievers]] that will steal parts off the ground at high speeds. If Cogmind can surpass all of these obstacles, a wide variety of unique parts of all types are available to loot. Like most prototypes, there is a chance they may be faulty, but they are among the strongest parts in the game.\n\n[[Heading]]Map Makeup[[/Heading]]\nThe map is divided into several distinct segments:\n[[Heading:2]]Opening Area[[/Heading]]\nThe bottom-left section of the map that Cogmind spawns in is the most \"normal\" section of the map. There are standard [[Security Squad|Security]] and [[Patrol Squad|Patrol Squads]] hanging around the area, and most types of usual machines are accessible here, although not [[Recycling Unit|Recycling Units]] or [[Fabricator|Fabricators]]. Similar to other Research Branch maps, there can be small 3-tile nooks indented into the map containing special guards. Patrols can also contain unique [[Hotshot]] [[Grunt]] variants.\nOne unique feature about this map is the presence of non-interactive machines that phase out of existence when passing them. These machine flash briefly on sight, but they cannot be interacted with in any way, including by dropping parts on top of them.\n[[Heading:2]]Forge Plexus Area[[/Heading]]\nThe Forge Plexus area is located in the bottom right section of the map, with the eponymous Forge Plexus located in the center of a room. This enormous machine is impossible to be destroyed as any destroyed tiles will reform very rapidly. This area is very heavily guarded, with 2 [[AP7-3|AP7-3s]] standing on the left entrance to this area of the map and Superfortress blocking the path to the top entrance. Additionally, 2 pairs of dormant [[EXE-6|EXE-6s]] guard the right and bottom left sides of the map, and 2 dormant [[Decapitator|Decapitators]] or 3 [[SKR-2|SKR-2s]] guard the bottom center area. Furthermore, the prototype [[Heavy]] [[Overlord]] spawns in this area, although it will typically roam into the bottom left section.\nN-04 Retrievers can be be created by the Plexus to pick up items dropped on the floor. The retrievers grab these items and then deposit them into the Forge Plexus. If there are no loose parts, Retrievers will be re-absorbed by the Plexus. The vault areas behind the glass walls in the back lab are safe from Retrievers, even for dropped parts. These spaces can be used as safe temporary storage.\nOn the top right area of the Forge Plexus area is a group of 4 Fabricators. At the bottom right is a group of 3 Recycling Units. The Recycling Machines are not used for their typical purpose since parts are returned to the Forge Plexus by Retrievers rather than inserted into Recycling Units by Recyclers. However, if Cogmind aligns with [[Optimus]] and [[UFD]], the 0bPrime attack on Protoforge can be started by performing the [[GameText]]Force(Fedlink)[[/GameText]] hack on one of these machines.\n[[Heading:2]]Superfortress Hallway[[/Heading]]\nThere is a long hallway that connects the top right of the Forge area with the top of the opening area. Up to 10 stockpiles of up to 4 parts per group can appear here, with 6 to the left of Superfortress and 4 to the right. In the middle is an initially dormant Superfortress, a very dangerous and intimidating Prototype bot. Nearby are one or two Researchers and a [[Terminal]] containing some lore about Superfortress.\n[[Heading:2]]Back Lab Area[[/Heading]]\nBehind Superfortress is a fixed prefab various rooms that immediately splits into a left and right side. 1 [[Garrison Access|Garrison]] is present on the left side of the map. To the left of that is another room containing the [[Crosscalibrator]], another item stockpile, and a Terminal containing a random selection of Prototype IDs of parts available on the map. This will grant a large number of IDs, but not all possible IDs of parts. There are also 8 different prototype vaults, 4 on each side. The locations of the vaults and their guard compositions are the same each run, but the types of parts that spawn in each vault are random. The same 8 groupings of parts will always appear somewhere on the map. At the top of the lab on the right side are CX-V1P's [[Tinkerer]] lab and one extra heavily-guarded vault with 2 AP7-3 guards.\nEach vault has a different combination of guards including Researchers, Hotshots, Decapitators, and [[V-Series]]. Most of the prototype bots are dormant, but have a visual range that must be stepped into in order to loot the vault. Additionally, some Researchers have a visual range that block all attempts to shoot open the vault walls by normal approach.\nThe hallways between the vaults are heavily trapped with a combination of [[Stasis Trap|Stasis]], [[Segregator Trap|Segregator]], and [[EM Surge Trap|EM Surge Traps]]. The top right guarded vault also can have [[Alarm Trap|Alarm Traps]] blocking the way. There are a few nooks with pairs of [[Sentry|Sentries]] at various points in the hallways. There are 2 roaming patrols made of Hotshots, Immortals, or Decapitators that go between different vaults, and 1 roaming patrol of a V-Series and following Researcher that walks from one side of the hallway to the other.\n\n[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]\n[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Protoforge[[/Lore]]\n\n[[Heading]]Notable Locations[[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]\nProtoforge Transparent Machine.webp|Transparent machine in starting area|\nProtoforge Forge Plexus Regenerating.webp|The Forge Plexus regenerating after some machine tiles were destroyed|\nProtoforge Superfortress.png|Dormant Superfortress with nearby Researchers|\nProtoforge Vault 1.png|1st left-side vault with Decapitators, V-Series, and Researcher|\nProtoforge Vault 2.png|2nd left-side vault with V-Series and a Researcher|\nProtoforge Vault 3.png|3rd left-side vault with Decapitators, Sentries, V-Series, and Researchers|\nProtoforge Vault 4.png|4th left-side vault with Immortals and Researcher|\nProtoforge Vault 5.png|1st right-side vault with V-Series and Researchers|\nProtoforge Vault 6.png|2nd right-side vault with Decapitators, V-Series, and Researcher|\nProtoforge Vault 7.png|3rd right-side vault with V-Series, Immortal, and a Researcher|\nProtoforge Vault 8.png|4th right-side vault with no guards|\nProtoforge Tinkerer Lab.png|CX-V1P's Tinkerer lab|\nProtoforge Vault 9.png|Heavily guarded vault with AP7-3s and Researchers|\nProtoforge Exit.png|Main access exit\n[[/Gallery]]\n[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]\nThere is only one exit in Protoforge. A main access will be in the top left of the opening area of the map, leading to the next main Research floor or [[Access]].\n\n[[Heading]]Superfortress[[/Heading]]\nSuperfortress is the defensive backbone of the Protoforge and sits in the center of the map. It is arguably the most powerful robot in the game, capable of regenerating core integrity and parts as well as assembling large numbers of allies in its defense. Fighting it head-on is one of the toughest challenges in the game, and successfully doing so will result in a hefty score bonus, a + on the scoresheet, and an immediate triggering of [[High Security]] unless the UFD attack has begun.\n[[Heading:2]]Dormancy[[/Heading]]\nSuperfortress is initially Dormant upon entering the map. Sneaking past Superfortress into the back area in this state is trivial, so it is ideal to retain this state if possible. Many things can trigger Superfortress to begin powering up from this state:\n[[List]]\nBeing spotted by a combat bot, [[Watcher]], or [[Operator]] without being jammed by a [[Transmission Jammers|Transmission Jammer]]. Note that some bots on the map are jamming immune. If the Transmission Jammer is used without a [[Jamming Amplifier]] attached, the random failure will also trigger the wake up.|\nBeing reported by an Operator at a Terminal.|\nDestroying an N-04 Retriever|\nBeing scanned by a Researcher|\nDigging through the outside Reinforced wall layer around the back lab area|\nBeginning the UFD assault on Protoforge|\nSuperfortress taking core damage|\nSuperfortress being teleported by a [[Supercharged TR]]\n[[/List]]\nIf any of these events occur, there will be a log message [[GameText]]Superfortress powering up for active defense.[[/GameText]] After 10 turns, Superfortress will wake up with a message [[GameText]]Superfortress completes startup sequence.[[/GameText]] if in view. After this, it will begin to assemble weapons.\n[[Heading:2]]Killing Strategy[[/Heading]]\nSee [[Strategy/Defeating Superfortress]]\n\n[[Heading]]Additional Responses[[/Heading]]\n[[Heading:2]]Additional Patrols[[/Heading]]\nCertain actions can cause additional patrol squads to come from the main exit or the Garrison. If the Garrison is open, these patrols will be groups of up to 4 Decapitators, Hotshots, or Immortals. If the Garrison is closed, they will instead be [[Hunter|Hunters]] and [[Programmer|Programmers]]. They will wander throughout the map randomly once dispatched.\n[[Heading:3]]Breaking Lab Walls[[/Heading]]\nWhen this occurs, there will be a log message [[GameText]]Research labs perimeter wall breached, dispatching additional patrols.[[/GameText]] 2 patrols will spawn.\n[[Heading:3]]Infiltrating Tinkerer Lab[[/Heading]]\nIf Cogmind enters the Infiltrator Lab, a log message will appear [[GameText]]Tinkerer labs infiltrated, dispatching additional patrols.[[/GameText]] 2 patrols will spawn.\n[[Heading:3]][[Plexus Tether]][[/Heading]]\nIf Cogmind attaches the Plexus Tether, all parts on the map will be identified and revealed. When this happens, 3-5 Decapitators will be dispatched to Cogmind's position. These bots will only be dispatched if the Garrison is intact, otherwise no bots are summoned.\n[[Heading:2]]Lack of [[Sterilization]][[/Heading]]\nUnlike most maps, Sterilization cannot occur inside the Protoforge. As a result, [[High Security]] can continue endlessly.\n[[Heading:2]]Advanced Fortification Protocols[[/Heading]]\nIf Superfortress is destroyed, the UFD assault is started, or High Security is activated, all subsequent maps will have \"Advanced fortification protocols\" activated. This has the following effect on maps:\n[[List]]50% increase in patrol density|\nPatrols can have non-standard bots. See [[Patrol Squad#advanced_fortification_protocols]] page for more details.|\nGarrison Accesses will be locked with no way to interact with them|\nSterilization on future maps will require double the number of kills to engage\n[[/List]]\n[[Heading:2]]UFD Sabotage[[/Heading]]\nIf aligned with UFD and Optimus, UFD agents will reduce the number of 0b10 Protoforge forces on the map. All prototype patrols, including additional prototype dispatches, will be reduced in size by 1-2 bots.\n\n[[Heading]]Available Loot[[/Heading]]\nThe available loot is divided into separate pools of items.\n[[Heading:2]]Superfortress Hallway Loot[[/Heading]]\nThe following items can be found in the hallway with Superfortress. Also, 1 extra stockpile in the Crosscalibrator room will have the same possible items.\n[[List]][[Cep. Antimissile System]]|[[Cep. Chromion Battery]]|[[Cep. Concussive Dispersal Blaster]]|[[Cep.

Waves of UFD forces led by [[Triborg (Optimus)]] will begin to emerge from an opening in the bottom right of the Forge Plexus room. Their goal is to planet and then set off 10 [[UFD Drillbomb|UFD Drillbombs]] spaced throughout the bottom left area of the map to isolate the Protoforge from the rest of 0b10. [[Lugger|Luggers]] will be accompanied by various UFD forces to plant the bombs while Optimus remains in the forge area. Cogmind can help the Luggers by protecting them or by planting the Drillbombs alone. Once all 10 bombs are planted in the areas marked in yellow, the UFD will announce that the bombs will go off in 100 turns. The walls separating the opening area from the rest of the map will get a red highlight, indicating the safe area of the map. Cogmind must either enter that part of the map to get the W9 wintype, or exit the map to continue the run. Doing neither will results in instant death after that 100 turns. Exiting the map at this point means that a W9 will not be possible.\n[[Heading:2]]UFD Reinforcements[[/Heading]]\nSeveral changes to this event can occur depending on whether or not the civil war occurs in [[Scraptown]]. If the civil war does not occur, [[7R-MNS]] will appear roughly 100 turns after starting the event and follow Cogmind around. If the civil war does occur, the maximum readiness which determines the strength of reinforcements will be capped at a lower level. The overall strength also depends on the number of resources Cogmind has built up over time and through Fedlink:\n[[Table]]\nReadiness|Civil War Range|No Civil War Range||\nMinimal|0-79|0-39||\nVery Low|80-99|40-59||\nLow|100-119|60-79||\nAdequate|120+|80-99||\nHigh|N/A|100-119||\nMaximal|N/A|120+\n[[/Table]]\nFor a more detailed explanation of UFD resources, see [[UFD#resource_mechanics|this page]].\nRoughly every 50 turns, a new wave of UFD bots will appear from the incursion point. Higher readiness levels result in stronger bots appearing more frequently. Low is the minimum readiness required for the strongest bots to spawn, and adequate is the minimum readiness required for the weakest bots to stop spawning. Waves can contain the following bots:\n[[Table]]\nUFD Readiness|Bots||\nAll levels|[[Elite (7)]], Lugger, [[Scrapper (6)]], [[Scrapoid (6)]], [[Scrapoid (8)]]||\nMinimal/Very Low|[[Bolteater]], [[Guru]], [[Explorer]], [[Federalist]], [[Ranger]]||\nLow|Bolteater, Guru, Explorer, Federalist, Ranger, [[Scraphulk (6)]], [[Scraphulk (8)]]||\nAdequate/High/Maximal|Scraphulk (6), Scraphulk (8)\n[[/Table]]\n[[Heading:2]]0b10 Reinforcements[[/Heading]]\n0b10 Reinforcements come in two forms: Garrison reinforcements and Main exit reinforcements.\n[[Heading:3]]Garrison Reinforcements[[/Heading]]\nPrototype squads will periodically be dispatched from the Protoforge Garrison if it is intact. The first time this happens, there will be a log message [[GameText]]New 0b10 prototypes are being dispatched from the Protoforge Garrison Access, destroy it to block them![[/GameText]] Squads will be one of the following:\n[[List]]1 AP7-3|\n3-5 Decapitators|\n1 EXE-6|\n3-4 Hotshots|\n2-3 Immortals|\n1 SKR-2[[/List]]\n[[Heading:3]]Main Exit Reinforcements[[/Heading]]\nSquads will always be dispatched from the main exit periodically. These reinforcements cannot be stopped unlike the Garrison reinforcements. 1 or 2 squads will be dispatched at a time, and each squad will consist of 2 [[Executioner|Executioners]] or 2 [[Striker|Strikers]] and a [[C-30 ARC]] with [[Assault Squad]] contents.\n[[Heading:2]]W9 Strategy[[/Heading]]\nSee [[Strategy/W9 Defending 0bPrime]].",

   "Content": "Quarantine is a [[0b10]]-controlled [[Branch]] off of [[Research]] that appears on either -3 or -2. It is always on the floor that [[Testing]] is not on. Quarantine is a much smaller and generally more manageable map compared to normal Research floors. There are few patrols, no [[Sentry]] or [[Heavy]] guards, and only a few special mini guard areas that can usually be easily avoided. There are unique [[Researcher]] bots that show up on this map that have dangerous effects when getting scanned. Quarantine is home to a large number of unique [[Alien Artifacts]] that can be strong equippable parts or consumable effects not found elsewhere. Unlike most maps, the ambient temperature in Quarantine is -20 rather than 0. This has the effect of giving an additional 20 heat dissipation per turn to all bots on the map. Like all Research branches, [[FarCom]] will trigger [[Maximum Security]] upon entry.\nTesting is home to the [[Sigix Containment Pod]], a captured [[Sigix]] warrior being trapped in a cage. Carrying the Sigix to the [[Surface]] is required to achieve a W3 [[Wintypes]]. The Sigix always spawns in the vertically opposite corner of the map that Cogmind first spawns on. For example, if Cogmind would spawn in the top-left section of the map, the Sigix would be in the bottom left. The Sigix is locked behind a [[Terminal]] and some Sealed Heavy Doors with 40 armor. After opening or digging past the doors, the Sigix will have some garbled dialogue unless Cogmind has used a [[Core Reset Matrix]] first. There will be a lockdown [[Patrol Squad|patrol squad]] dispatched consisting of an [[I-47 Archangel]] and 3 [[Lightning|Lightnings]] at this point. They do not have active tracking on Cogmind but simply patrol around the area. Behind the doors, one Terminal contains the access code needed to be used on the other Terminal to open the 80 armor Sigix Quarantine Chamber.\n\n[[Heading]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]\nThere is one special type of machine in Quarantine called the Cryocooling Duct. There is usually at least one of these on every Quarantine floor. The map is affected by how many ducts are destroyed:\n[[List]]0: The ambient temperature of the map is -20|1: The ambient temperature of the map rises to 0. All noncombat (green) bots are called to evacuate map and will head toward the nearest exit. This does [[Researcher|Researchers]] and green [[Operator|Operators]] that have already spotted Cogmind, but yellow Operators and [[Watcher|Watchers]] will not exit the map.|2: The ambient temperature becomes +20 which will apply 20 heat to all bots on the map every turn. All combat hostiles will be called to evacuate the map and most forms of squad dispatches will stop happening, including [[Assault Squad|Assaults]] and [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]]. Note: The recall and dispatch prevention does not occur if Maximum Security is engaged. After about 100 turns, 12 [[Quarantine Guard|Quarantine Guards]] will be dispatched to the map. Some will patrol around the map looking for hostiles, while others will guard key spots like exits and the [[Garrison Access|Garrison]] (if any are present).|3+: Ambient heat continues to rise +20 per destroyed machine, but no other special effects occur.[[/List]]\n\n[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]\n[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Quarantine[[/Lore]]\n\n[[Heading]]Notable Locations[[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Quarantine Corpses.png|Autopsy Lab containing a lore Terminal and [[Sigix Corpse|Sigix Corpses]]|Quarantine Cyrocooling Duct.png|Room containing Cryocooling Duct machine|Quarantine Teleport Lab.png|Teleportation Lab containing [[Transdimensional Reconstructor|regular]] and [[Hpw.

These exits can only happen after Quarantine, but are not necessarily on the same floor. A large 4 tile doorway will show up on the middle of the map, on the right side of where the map typically ends. It will open up into a 6 tile hallway and a [[Fortress]] will be guarding the path to the exits. These exits will be closed if Cogmind is FarCom aligned.[[/Redacted]][[/List]]",

   "Content": "Recycling is an early game [[0b10]]-controlled [[Branch]] with few active combat hostiles. The 3 ways to enter this branch are by using the [[GameText]]\\\\IAMDERELICT[[/GameText]] code at the Recycling exit in [[Storage]], by entering a Storage [[Garrison Access|Garrisons]] and looping back into this floor instead of proceeding to the next depth, or by taking the guarded exit in [[Subcaves]]. There are a few dormant [[Sentry|Sentries]] guarding hallways and several more in rooms with large amounts of rewirable bots. Unlike most 0b10 maps, more combat bots will not be summoned in any scenario. Recycling is unique in that it forces a skipped depth. For example, entering a Storage map on -8 leads to a Recycling map on -8 that leads to a [[Factory]] map on -6 rather than -7 like most branches.\nThe main benefits to going to Recycling are for [[Scraptown]] or obtaining the unique [[Scrap Engine]] from the scraplab. Because there are no combat reinforcements of any kind, there are few downsides to getting traced at all of the [[Terminal|Terminals]] and [[Recycling Unit|Recycling Units]] aside from minor [[Alert]] gain. There are a large number of Recycling Units on this map and using [[GameText]]Force(Tunnel)[[/GameText]] on all of them can be very helpful in uncovering the depths of many maps in the floors above. There are commonly a large number of [[Corrupted Parts|corrupted]] [[Authchips]] available for players who want to do a lot of [[Fabricator|Fabrication]]. A small army can be raised off of the rewirable bots in some of the rooms, though tend to be heavily damaged.\n\n[[Heading]]Notable Locations[[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Recycling Corrupted Authchips.png|Collection of corrupted Authchips|Recycling Dormant Rewirable Bots.png|Room of broken, dormant, and rewirable bots|Recycling Damaged Cache.png|Cache of damaged parts|Recycling Damaged Parts Room.png|Room of damaged parts|Recycling Dormant Sentries.png|Dormant Sentries guarding a corridor|Recycling Scraptown Entrance.png|Seemingly empty room leading to the Scraplab|Recycling Main Access Exit.png|3 tile wide corridor leading to main access exit|Recycling Scraplab.png|The Scraplab and the Scraptown exit[[/Gallery]]\n\n[[Heading:2]]Scraplab[[/Heading]]\nCogmind can gain access to the Scraplab by entering a particular dead end-seeming rectangular room. Inside are Terminals providing information on the [[Scrap Engine]] and a way to eject the Scrap Engine. Beware that releasing the Scrap Engine will count as a hostile action and cause the Scraptown exit to close and all inhabitants of the Scraplab to become hostile. This also causes [[Zion]] and [[Warlord]] to become hostile to Cogmind. One additional [[Scrapper (3)]] will appear from the exit to attack Cogmind when this happens. If the [[Recycling#Subdweller_attack|Subdweller Attack]] is occurring, the lab will be empty and taking the Scrap Engine will not trigger any hostilities.\n[[Heading:3]][[SUBCON Basin]] delivery[[/Heading]]\nIf the full SUBCON basin is delivered from Subcaves and dropped on the ground, one of the [[Scientist|Scientists]] will drop a [[Tech Extrapolator]] on the ground. This is the only way to obtain one without attacking Scraptown, as the Extrapolators attached to the scientists in the lab will explode after death.\n[[Heading:2]][[01-MTF]][[/Heading]]\nIf 01-MTF is brought from Storage to the Scraplab, a special event will occur. 01-MTF will try to explain something to [[KN-7UR]], but KN-7UR will say that his time is up, and they will begin to fight. Cogmind may choose to help out in the fight. If Cogmind attacks KN-7UR and 01-MTF wins the fight, 01-MTF will drop a 99 charge [[Relay Coupler [Proto]]]. If Cogmind attacks 01-MTF and KN-7UR wins, KN-7UR will drop their [[KN-7UR's Autopenetrator]].\n[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]\nThere are two types of exit in Recycling:\n[[List]]Main access exit: This will always lead to the [[Factory]] map that is 2 floors above the current depth.|Scraptown exit: The exit through the Scraplab will always lead to Scraptown on the same depth.[[/List]]\n[[Image]]Recycling Warlord Attack.png|Derelicts attacking Recycling[[/Image]]\n\n[[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]\n[[Heading:2]]Warlord attack[[/Heading]]\nThere is a rare Recycling event where the floor is stormed by white colored friendly but uncontrollable [[Warlord]]-aligned Derelicts. They will beeline toward the exit, stopping only to shoot any hostiles they encounter. On exiting the floor, a few squads of the Warlord bots will also spawn on the next map and roam around.[[Heading:2]][[Subdweller]] attack[[/Heading]]\nIf Cogmind visits Subcaves, then exits to [[Materials]] using the normal exit instead of the Recycling exit, and then visits Recycling later, the map will be attacked by Subdwellers. The standard Scraptown entrance will not open up for Cogmind and the Scraplab will be abandoned. Stealing the Scrap Engine when this is happening will not trigger hostilities.",

   "Content": "Research is a [[0b10]]-controlled main floor that appears on both -3 and -2. Research maps continue to amp up the difficulty in strength and number of general combat encounters, hacking difficulty, and difficulty in locating exits. Compared to the previous [[Factory]] floors, Research maps are just as big, but are much more maze-like with large numbers of smaller interconnected rooms and big sections of the level entirely disconnected by large chunks of earth. Exploring all of these different rooms is more difficult than before, and finding an exit can be a real challenge.\nUnlike factory floors with [[Caves]] available, there are usually no easy exits to dissipate [[Alert]] in Research. The natural alert dissipation that occurs between levels continues to decrease. Purging alert or avoiding generating it in the first place can be a big deal if the player is not prepared to fight off [[High Security]]. [[Infowar]] continues to be important to avoid unnecessary encounters whenever possible, and [[Hackware]] should be used to purge alert and locate exits whenever possible.\nAs the difficulty increases, the rewards do to match. Many powerful unique parts can be found in Research specific branches [[Testing]] and [[Quarantine]]. There are also more [[Prototype Part|Prototypes]] lying around on the floor. Using a [[Component Analysis Suites|Component Analysis Suite]] can pay off to avoid attaching faulty prototypes.\nA big change in Research is the final upgrade of Programmers. The 1-2 [[P-70 Sage|Sages]] per [[Extermination Squad|Extermination]] get upgraded to being 2-3 [[P-80 Master|Masters]]. The extra Programmer on average, higher core integrity, and higher damage output make them a serious threat to prepare for. Many builds will live or die based on how well they can handle Exterminations. Look for a way to kill in a single core shot, like using a [[Enh. Nova Cannon]]. Airborne builds can instead make use of recall hacks or get spotted and run away to avoid direct combat.\nOther important Research level bot upgrades are [[Heavy|Heavies]] and [[Hunter|Hunters]] upgrading to their highest tier on -2. The [[H-81 Overseer]] deals a frightening 91 damage per volley, becomes even tougher to kill, and gains a visual upgrade to 22 tiles which is further than the telltale 20 tile range of the [[Active Sensor Suite]]. The [[H-88 Terminator]] is also a very formidable opponent. The scary changes here are the upgrade from an [[Imp. Phase Shifter]] to an [[Adv. Phase Shifter]] which makes them even more difficult to hit, and the Scan Cloak (4) trait which makes them invisible on [[Sensor Arrays]] unless using an [[Exp. Signal Interpreter]]. If fighting them head on, using [[Launchers]] to aim indirectly or Treads with [[Siege Mode]] can help a lot.\n\n[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]\n[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Research[[/Lore]]\n\n[[Heading]]Notable Locations[[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Research Main Access Exit.png|A 4 tile wide corridor into a main access exit|Research Undefined Exit.png|An unremarkable exit that could lead anywhere|Research Quarantine Exit.png|Unlocked exit to [[Quarantine]]|Research Locked Quarantine Exit.png|Locked exit to [[Quarantine]]|Research Guarded Quarantine Exit.png|Open exit to [[Quarantine]] guarded by a [[B-90 Cyclops]][[/Gallery]]\n[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]\nThere are 4 types of main exits on Research floors.

These can sometimes be identifiable by a 4 tile wide corridor that leads into a dead end with the exit in the middle. Otherwise, any non-prefab exit could be a main access exit. [[Signal Interpreters]] or [[Terminal]] access hacks are the main ways to identify these types of exits. There will always be 3 of these exits per map.|[[Spoiler]][[Quarantine]] exit: This is the only other type of exit that can be identified. Quarantine exits can sometimes be identified when they appear as a prefab with several locked or unlocked rows of blast doors. There are also otherwise unremarkable exits that can also lead to Quarantine. These exits will always be on the floor that there are no Testing exits on. There will always be 2 exits on the same depth that Quarantine is on.[[/Spoiler]]|[[Spoiler]][[Testing]] exit: These exits are always indistinguishable from any other type of exit. There will always be 2 exits on the same depth that Testing is on.[[/Spoiler]]|[[Spoiler]][[Armory]] exit: These exits are always indistinguishable from any other type of exit. There will only be 1 exit on the depth that Armory is on.[[/Spoiler]][[/List]]\nOne other type of additional exit is the [[DSF]]. These exits continue on from Factory and have the same auto-lock on hostile sight behavior. Getting inside is difficult.\n\n[[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]\n[[Spoiler]][[Image]]Research Revisions.png|Revision 17++ with Revision allies[[/Image]][[/Spoiler]]\nThere are 2 major Research-specific events.

Eventually, the Terminal network will be shut down, and [[Prototype Robot|Prototype]] [[Executioner|Executioners]] and [[Striker|Strikers]] will be dispatched along with assault [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]].\n[[Image]]Research Warlord Entrance.png|Warlord making an entrance with friends[[/Image]]\n[[Heading:2]]-2 [[Warlord (Alignment)|Warlord Invasion]][[/Heading]]\nIf Warlord is aligned with in his [[Warlord (Location)|base]], he will bring huge groups of [[Derelict]] forces to attack Research.

Scraptown contains many different groups of Derelicts and most have various rooms that can appear from run to run. The overall layout of Scraptown is the same each run, but the rooms will contain different combinations of groups each time. There are C-Scrubber machines at the entrance and all exits on this map that will cleanse corruption, and their use is recommended to avoid misfiring and causing accidental hostilities.\nThe map always consists of an open left area that all bots are free to explore. The map is divided by a giant UFD HQ Gate with [[Triborg]] guarding nearby. The gate has 60 armor and high resistances to all main damage types except for Thermal damage. Realistically, the only options to cut through are [[Plasma Cutters|Plasma Cutter]] or the [[Siege Cannon]]. However, the gate will open automatically if Cogmind becomes UFD aligned. The right side of the map contains many more unique rooms.\n\n[[Heading]]Alignment - [[UFD]][[/Heading]]\nTalking to the Scrapper standing next to the UFD registry near the HQ gate will allow Cogmind to become a UFD member and enter the right side of the map.

Optimus will have dialogue 30 and 80 turns after talking, indicating that Cogmind shouldn't stick around too long. After 400 turns or 72 moves, whichever happens sooner, a cutscene will reveal that Optimus has a secret plan that puts Scraptown in danger.\nAfter the civil war has started, about half of the assorted UFD bots will align with 0bPrime and the rest will be hostile to 0bPrime bots (including Optimus and all [[Elite (4)|Elites]]) and Cogmind. During this war, Cogmind is free to smash walls and collect loot on the map.\n[[Heading:2]]Civil War Looting[[/Heading]]\nThe civil war is a great time to loot the various parts on the map that are normally locked  behind aggro. Cogmind can freely kill any hostile bots and dig through walls without penalty. Nearly all parts are available during the civil war, although IN-MT5's Pitchfork schematic cannot be acquired using this method.\n\n[[Heading]]Hostilities[[/Heading]]\nThe UFD is typically friendly to Cogmind but will turn hostile if Cogmind attacks a bot or digs through any dirt or machine tiles. There are a large amount of bots that will turn hostile to Cogmind, so attacking should not be done lightly. If Cogmind is capable of taking down all of its inhabitants, there are a large number of unique items that are only available by attacking Scraptown.\n[[Heading:2]]Attack Mechanics[[/Heading]]\nAfter Cogmind either attacks a bot or destroys a wall or machine tile, every UFD bot will turn hostile to Cogmind with the message [[GameText]]Intruder alert! Defend Scraptown![[/GameText]]. When this happens, the HQ gate will open up by 2 tiles, non-combat bots like [[Scientist|Scientists]] will begin to exit the map, and combat bots will start heading to the center of the map. After that, certain events will occur in a predictable fashion:\n[[List]]\n~100 turns: 4 [[Scrapper (3)|Scrappers]] will come from the left exit and guard it.|\n~105 turns: The message [[GameText]]Triborg tracking relay activated. Stay clear or you only have yourself to blame![[/GameText]] appears. Triborg will gain tracking on Cogmind and pursue throughout the map. A small group of other combat bots will follow along with him. Triborg will shoot through walls like a [[Behemoth]], so hiding is not particularly effective|\n~400-600 turns: The message [[GameText]]HQ reinforcements inbound. Hold Tight![[/GameText]] will appear. When this happens, Optimus will gain tracking on Cogmind. About 25 various combat bots will trail after him.|\n+100 turns (~500-700 turns): Reinforcements will start to appear from exits on the left and right sides of the map. A large group of bots will appear instantly, and more will trickle onto the map over time. These bots travel in groups like [[Patrol Squad|Patrol Squads]].\n|+250 turns (~750-950 turns): The message [[GameText]]Sorry everyone, if you're still alive to receive this, we've run out of nearby reinforcements. Consider running and hiding![[/GameText]]\n[[/List]]\n[[Heading:2]]Attacking Strategy[[/Heading]]\nSee [[Strategy/Attacking Scraptown]]\n\n[[Heading]]Loot from Murder[[/Heading]]\nSome loot can be obtained by killing certain bots on the map:\n[[List]]\n[[Exp.

The top left chamber can contain 1-3 Terrabombs. The chamber just to the right of that contains 1-4 [[Transdimensional Reconstructor|Normal]] or [[Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor|Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructors]]. Next on the right is a chamber with a guaranteed [[Drained L-Cannon]] and 0-2 [[Matter Drive|Matter Drives]]. On the far right, hidden behind a large mass of machinery, is a room with 1-3 [[Sigix Sheargun|Sigix Shearguns]] and rarely a [[Sigix Shearcannon]] in the chamber below guarded by a [[Watcher]] and two dormant [[Striker|Strikers]] on the inside, and a further two on the outside. All will be awoken by the Watcher.\n[[Heading:3]]LRC Lab[[/Heading]]There are 2 different groups of Alien Artifact spawns in the LRC lab. The Suspension Chambers on the top-right side and the top-left side of the map share a single pool of items. The left side can have anywhere from 1-3 copies of the same Artifact. Neither are guaranteed, but choose from the following pool of items:\n[[List]][[Core Expander]]|[[Core Reset Matrix]]|[[Integrated Dissipator]]|[[Integrated Reactor]]|[[Integrity Redistributor]][[/List]]\nThe LRC cache at the bottom of this area can contain the following items (duplicates allowed):\n[[List]][[LRC Armor]]|[[LRC Inertial Stabilizer]]|[[LRC Energy Well]]|[[LRC Insulator]]|[[LRC Matter Compressor]]|[[LRC Storage]][[/List]]\n[[Heading:3]][[Sigix Exoskeleton]][[/Heading]]The room at the bottom right of the map is the Exoskeleton. There is a Terminal on the right and the unpowered Exoskeleton at the bottom behind a Suspension Chamber. The Exoskeleton can become the [[Sigix Warrior]] when the [[Sigix Containment Pod]] is carried from Quarantine into this chamber and the Activate Exoskeleton hack is performed. The Warrior will follow Cogmind as a normal ally and can be used for the W3 [[Wintypes|Wintype]]. When fighting, the Sigix Warrior will sometimes log the message [[GameText]]Synergy achieved. Target locked: {target}[[/GameText]]. When this occurs, both the Warrior and Cogmind will gain a 15% targeting bonus against the target.\nIf a [[Core Reset Matrix]] is used, the log message [[GameText]]Sigix Exoskeleton lights up in response to your presence[[/GameText]], and attempting to walk into it will add [[GameText]]Exoskeleton opens, ready for integration override sequence[[/GameText]]. Repeating the movement will force Cogmind into the Exoskeleton and strip all parts. Cogmind will receive innate buffs to energy storage, energy generation, and heat dissipation depending on how many slots were \"consumed\" as a part of this process. The final slot distribution is 1 power slot, 3 propulsion slots (with an nondetachable Sigix Exoskeleton part), 3 utility slots, and 2 weapon slots that are filled with (detachable) Sigix Shearguns. Evolution can occur as normal from this point on. Most parts will be well protected with the extremely high coverage of the Exoskeleton, but as a tradeoff Cogmind takes 25% of all damage dealt to the Exoskeleton additionally as core damage. Some additional benefits are an 18-radius perfect robot, terrain, and item detection info, a distance from exit indicator, and spawns of [[Assembled (7)|Assembled]] from the ground in main 0b10 floors and [[Command]].\nIf either Cogmind wearing the Exoskeleton or the Sigix Warrior are spotted by a hostile, [[Maximum Security]] will immediately be engaged.\n[[Heading:3]]Power Cell[[/Heading]]\nOne of the machines in the hangar is the Power Cell. It is a heavily armored and extremely explosive machine, with a 20 radius 250 entropic damage explosion that will instantly destroy all hostiles in range. One of the [[Lab]] orders that are accessible when using the [[Data Conduit]] will provide a manual explosion code. The Power Cell Monitoring Terminal will accept this code and start a 20 turn countdown before the machine explodes.\n[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]\nThere is only one exit in Section 7.

Storage maps tend to be fairly cramped just like [[Materials]] maps but with fewer patrols and many more [[Y-45 Defender|Sentries]] guarding individual rooms and corridors. There is an unusually high number of [[A-02 Transporter|Haulers]] in these maps. Destroying them for their loot is highly recommended on -9 and -8. On -7 however, many of the Haulers will begin summoning [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcements]] that can cause trouble. The majority of the [[Prototype Part|Prototype Parts]] at this point in the game will be weapons or flight units, so players trying to prepare for a flight transition should consider visiting Storage on -9 or -8. Combat players should also consider Storage as a good way to stock up on early game weaponry. -7 Storage is considered generally inferior to [[Caves]] because Caves has the advantage of [[Alert]] reduction as well as unique branch rewards.\nStorage is notable for the large number of prototype parts available.

There are few patrols, no [[Sentry]] or [[Heavy]] guards, and only a few special mini guard areas that can usually be easily avoided. There are unique [[Researcher]] bots that show up on this map that have dangerous effects when getting scanned. There are also powerful special and unique items that are not obtainable anywhere else. Even among normal parts, there is a much higher than usual chance of finding [[Prototype Part|Prototype Parts]] on the ground. Like all Research branches, [[FarCom]] will trigger [[Maximum Security]] upon entry.\nTesting is home to the [[SGEMP Prototype]] that [[Zhirov]] asks for when you see him in his [[Zhirov (Location)|lab]]. It is guarded by 2 [[Striker|Strikers]] and an [[Alpha 7]]. The SGEMP always spawns in the vertically opposite corner of the map that Cogmind first spawns on. For example, if Cogmind would spawn in the top-left section of the map, the SGEMP would be in the bottom left. With the [[Phasing AFG]] and [[Portable AFG]], it is possible to retrieve the SGEMP without getting spotted at all. Otherwise the primary methods of obtaining are fighting the bots head-on or grabbing it and making a run for it.\n\n[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]\n[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Testing[[/Lore]]\n\n[[Heading]]Notable Locations[[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Testing Guard Corridor.png|Guard corridor that can have 1-3 guard bots|Testing Rewirable Protovariant.png|Rewirable Protovariant|Testing Hostile Protovariant.png|Awake and hostile Protovariant|Testing Dormant Protovariant.png|Dormant hostile Protovariant|Testing Unpowered Protovariant.png|Unpowered Protovariant that won't activate|Testing Superbehemoth.png|Dormant [[Superbehemoth]] with Researcher|Testing Firing Range.png|Shooting range with prototype weapons and rewirable bots|Testing SGEMP.png|SGEMP with Striker and Alpha 7 guards|Testing Potential Cannons.png|Potential Cannons and Energy Wells|Testing Regen Armor.png|Vault with [[SHELL Armor]] and other regenerative armor|Testing Generic Vault.png|Generic Testing Shell that has many item possibilities inside|Testing Terrabomb Derivative.png|[[Terrabomb Derivative]] with Researchers|Fortress Guard.png|[[Fortress]] guarding the corridor to branch exits|Testing Main Access.png|Main access exit|Branch Section 7 Protoforge Exits.png|Exits to [[Section 7]] and [[Protoforge]][[/Gallery]]\n[[Heading:2]][[Protovariant|Protovariants]][[/Heading]]\nThere can be up to 2 Protovariants on a Testing map. These are prototype superpowered versions of different bot classes that have a very strong loadout of high rating prototype parts. They are fearsome foes with high damage output and are quite difficult to take down compared to most bots but have incredible loot. They can spawn in one of 4 states: Unpowered, Dormant, Active, or Disabled/rewirable. Protovariants can be of the following types:\n[[List]][[Protovariant D]]: Demolisher|[[Protovariant G]]: Grunt|[[Protovariant H]]: Hunter|[[Protovariant L]] Duelist|[[Protovariant P]]: Programmer|[[Protovariant X]]: Specialist|[[Protovariant Y]]: Sentry[[/List]]\nIn Testing there is a special hack that can appear on [[Terminal|Terminals]]: [[GameText]]Control(Protovariants)[[/GameText]]. If successfully performed, it will turn a Protovariant on the map hostile to everything. The Protovariant can make quite a mess of 0b10 bots, but may cause more trouble than it's worth. Researchers will report the bot repeatedly when they see it attack. There is a special assault [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] that gets dispatched to the Protovariant's location when this hack is performed. This ARC contains an [[Investigator]] inside that will scan Cogmind even without being provoked. Sometimes a Protovariant will enter the out of control state even if Cogmind does not perform the [[GameText]]Control(Protovariants)[[/GameText]] hack.\n[[Heading:2]]Testing Shells[[/Heading]]\nThe majority of unique Testing items appear in Reinforced Shells. There are no identifying features that indicate the contents of these Shells. The list of unique Testing items contained within are:\n[[List]][[2N-1CE's Frost Array]]|[[AEGIS Remote Shield]]|[[Cld. Nova Cannon]]|[[Disintegrator]]|[[Exp. Hardlight Generator]]|[[Ghost Barrier]]|[[Hpw. Disruptor Cannon]]|[[Hvy. Quantum Rifle]]|[[Hyp. EM Gauss Rifle]]|[[Hyp. Multirail]]|[[Myomer Exoskeleton]]|[[Null Cannon]]|[[Omega Cannon]]|[[Perforator]]|[[Portable AFG]]|[[System Mapper]]|[[Tachyon Dispersion Ray]]|[[Warp Gun]]|[[Z-bomb Delivery System]][[/List]]\nThere are 2 unique prefabs that do not contain any of the above items and have their own list. One prefab has 1-2 [[Potential Cannon|Potential Cannons]] or [[Imp. Potential Cannon|Imp. Potential Cannons]] (not necessarily the same type) and several [[Imp. Energy Well|Imp]], [[Adv. Energy Well|Adv.]], or [[Exp. Energy Well|Exp. Energy Wells]]. The other shell is locked behind Sealed Heavy Doors and has a special Researcher behind. The Terminal can be hacked to open the doors, but the Researcher will make it difficult to break the Shell without getting scanned. However, penetrating the heavy doors first will allow safely killing the Researcher. It is also possible to dig in to the back of the prefab directly into the Shell area. The shell will always contain [[SHELL Armor]] and 3 random pieces of [[Lgt. Regenerative Plating]], [[Med. Regenerative Plating]], or [[Hvy. Regenerative Plating]]. The Terminal on the inside of the shell contains schematic for some of the regenerative platings.\n[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]\nThere is always 1, and possibly 3 exits in Testing:\n[[List]]Main access exit: There will always be 1 exit that leads to the next main Research or [[Access]] floor. It will always be at a dead end at a tile corridor near the top-middle or bottom-middle of the map.|[[Redacted]]Section 7 and Protoforge exits: These exit only appears some of the time. [[Quarantine]] must have been first on the world map, so these exits can only show up when Testing is on -2. A large 4 tile doorway will show up on the middle of the map, on the right side of where the map typically ends. It will open up into a 6 tile hallway and a [[Fortress]] will be guarding the path to the exits. These exits will be closed if Cogmind is FarCom aligned.[[/Redacted]][[/List]]",

   "Content": "The Warlord base is a [[Caves]] [[Branch]] that appears on -5 or -4 and is named after the eponymous bot [[Warlord]]. This map is home to a large number of [[Derelict|Derelicts]] allied with Warlord and ready to fight. This branch is much more combat-oriented than many of the other Caves branches, with large waves of [[0b10]] bots assaulting the base. Initially the map is totally safe and filled with friendly NPCs, but after one of several conditions is met a large assault will begin.\nThe right side of the map is the same every run. There is a small cave-like area with an exit just above the starting area. There are a few [[Dirty Bomb Trap|Dirty Bomb Traps]] spread around this section of the map, so be prepared if Cogmind has any [[Corruption]]. There are two entrances into the base: The first has some doors blocking a large corruption-cleansing System Quarantine Field Array, some opened Blast Doors, and a second set of regular doors opening up into 2 [[Marauder (6)|Marauders]]. This entrance has a large number of [[Fire Trap|Fire Traps]] installed. The second way in is either on the top or the bottom of the map, hidden behind some fake walls. These will automatically open if approached from the inside of the base. Behind these fake walls are a set of Sealed Heavy Doors, followed by one more set of fake walls. If Cogmind is [[RIF]] aligned, they will be detected and the entire base will be turned hostile. This occurs no matter which entrance is taken. It is safe to get the corruption cleanse, but any further will be dangerous.\nThe interior of the base is different every run. There are always 3 guaranteed rooms in every run. The first is the Vortex Lab which is locked behind Sealed Heavy Doors with a [[Terminal]] to open it next to them. Inside are some [[Tinkerer|Tinkerers]], a lore Terminal, and a random assortment of Vortex weaponry. There will always be at least one pair of weapons from the following list:\n[[List]][[Vortex Cannon]]|[[Vortex Driver]]|[[Vortex Lance]]|[[Vortex Rail]]|[[Vortex Rifle]]|[[Vortex Shotgun]][[/List]]\nThere may also be a single [[Vortex Catalyst Activator]], and if this is a seed where the [[Exiles (Group)|Exiles]] abandoned their hideout, [[EX-DEC]] will be present along with a [[BFG-9k Vortex Edition]]. Another guaranteed room is Warlord's throne room. Inside are Warlord himself, 6 [[Thug (7)|Thugs]], 2 [[Knight|Knights]], and [[God Mode (Fake)|Fake God Mode]]. The final room is Warlord's stash which is locked by [[Reinforced Walls|Sealed Heavy Doors]]. The nearby Terminal can be hacked open with a special code obtained at a Terminal in [[Data Miner (Location)]].\nThe contents of Warlord's stash will vary every game with only the Vortex Chain Reactor being guaranteed. The contents can be as follows:\n[[List]](guaranteed) [[Vortex Chain Reactor]]|[[Adv. Remote Shield]] or [[Adv. Remote Force Field]]|[[Exp. Phase Shifter]], [[Exp. Targeting Computer]], or [[Exp. Cloaking Device]]|1-2 of one of [[Electron Diverter]], [[Imp. Diametric Drive]], or [[Cld. Impulse Thruster]]|1-2 of one of [[Exp. Myomer Leg]] or [[Enh. Biometal Leg]]|1-2 of one of [[Cld.

Focal Shield]], or [[System Purifier]][[/List]]\n\n[[Heading]]Alignment - [[Warlord (Alignment)|Warlord]][[/Heading]]\nAfter entering Warlord's throne room, he will explain his plan to attack upper 0b10. As long as he survives until Cogmind exits the map and the 0b10 forces attack, he will attack on -2 [[Research]]. This will occur even if you turn the Warlord forces hostile before exiting the map. Keep in mind, it is possible for a fast Flight build to leave before the assault begins which will prevent the invasion. Along with this Research event, there is another event in [[Command]] that this affects: [[Redacted]]When the Command cave seals are opened, [[Warlord (Command)]] will pop out along with various other Warlord-aligned Derelicts.[[/Redacted]] This alignment is incompatible with RIF or attacking [[Scraptown]] as Warlord will be hostile when entering the base. It is also incompatible with [[Imprint]] or [[UFD]] alignment, as Warlord will not be happy talking with Cogmind. If the [[Encrypted Comm Array]] has been obtained, Warlord will thank Cogmind for assisting his forces. At this point, no more forces will be summonable and the Array can be dropped.\n\n[[Heading]]Notable Locations[[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Warlord Assembled Lab.png|[[Tinkerer]] examining some [[Assembled (4)|Assembled]]|Warlord Watcher Feeds Derelict.png|Tinkerer who claims to have discovered a way to download Watcher Feeds|Warlord Watcher Feeds Effect.png|Effects of previous \"Watcher Feeds\" hack|Warlord Dormant Derelicts.png|Dormant Derelicts that wake up after the invasion begins|Warlord Trapped Marauder.png|Unpowered Marauder built in a small room|Warlord Shooting Challenge.png|Thugs shoot some unpowered wild derelicts which power and become hostile|Warlord Dormant Thugs.png|A group of dormant thugs|Cogmind Dormant Prototype.png|Dormant Prototype bots can also appear, for example a [[Hydra]] here|Warlord Recruits.png|New Warlord recruits|Warlord Rewirable Bots.png|[[Surgeon (6)|Surgeons]] with various rewirable 0b10 bots|Warlord Sappers.png|[[Sapper|Sappers]] with [[Thermoblaster|Thermoblasters]], [[Mak.

Destruction from corruption triggering a Dirty Bomb Trap does not count, but destruction from corruption misfires do. When at least 4 but less than ~8 tiles or machines were destroyed, a warning announcement will appear: [[GameText]]Heightened seismic activity detected outside base. Stay alert for hostiles.[[/GameText]][[/List]]\nAfter any of these conditions is met, large groups of 0b10 forces will come from an opening in either the top-right, middle-right, or bottom-right section of the map. These bots roam around the map randomly in groups, but usually come straight through the main entrance. When this happens, a large group of [[Bouncer|Bouncers]] will join the existing Marauder guards at the front gate. The first wave will usually be decimated by the entryway traps, but many more will follow.\nThere are a total of 14 assault waves, although it is highly recommended to leave the map before that many enemy bots appear. 10 turns after the first [[GameText]]MAIN.C incursion imminent. Mobilizing sentries[[/GameText]] announcement, the first wave will appear with the announcement [[GameText]]Northeast/Southeast/Central east cave walls breached[[/GameText]] indicating where the spawn location is. From then on, waves will spawn in 100 turn increments. Every 90 turns will give a [[GameText]]MAIN.C reinforcements approaching through caves, arriving soon[[/GameText]] announcement, and 10 turns after that the waves will spawn with an announcement of the wave composition. 4 squads can spawn per wave.\n[[Image]]Warlord Assault Wave.png|A typical assault wave. Pictured are Saboteur, Hunter, Melee, and Grunt squads with Prototype support[[/Image]]\n[[Heading:2]]Assault Contents[[/Heading]]\nThe hostile forces are made up of different types of squads, each with their own squad leader:\n[[List]]Behemoth Squad: [[Behemoth|Behemoths]]|Demolisher Squad: [[Demolisher|Demolishers]] with a [[Protector]]|Grunt Squad: [[Grunt|Grunts]], sometimes with a [[Specialist]] squad leader or [[Protector]] support|Hunter Squad: [[Hunter|Hunters]] and [[Swarmer|Swarmers]]|Melee Squad: [[Duelist|Duelists]], [[Brawler|Brawlers]] with a [[Protector]]|Mixed Squad: [[Grunt|Grunts]], [[Duelist|Duelists]], [[Brawler|Brawlers]], and [[Mechanic|Mechanics]]|Programmer Squad: [[Programmer|Programmers]]|Saboteur Squad: [[E-15 Imp|Imps]] and [[Grunt|Grunts]]|Swarmer Squad: [[Swarmer|Swarmers]][[/List]]\nSometimes these squads can spawn with \"Prototype Support\". When this happens, [[Executioner]] and [[Striker]] bots can also appear as part of a squad.\n[[Heading:2]]Assisting[[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]Warlord Wall Lure.png|Luring hostiles around the wall[[/Image]]Staying and fighting near the main entryway is one of the best approaches to fighting the waves off. Join in with [[Launchers]] if you have them, but make sure to watch out for friendly fire. There is a bit of leeway, but hitting allies too many times will be considered a betrayal. Demolishers and Programmers are the highest priority targets since they can cause a lot of damage with Launchers and robot hacking respectively. Throwing Claymores and the Vortex Catalyst Activator that can both be obtained on this map are great options to destroy waves with ease. [[Visual Processing Units]] coupled with long ranged weapons are another good option to sit back and snipe bots from outside their typical range. The entrance defense is quite strong and will perform well most of the time. However, a squad of Programmers with an unlucky chain-assimilation of bots or some unchecked Demolishers will quickly tear any defense to pieces.\nEven a build with little offensive power can help out in this part of the defense. Getting spotted first will cause hostiles to prioritize Cogmind for a while, even if they are getting shot by something else. This means that the Warlord bots can blast away all the hostiles while they are trying to run after you. This can work well for combat builds too, especially for combat hostiles without launchers of their own.\n[[Heading:2]]Counterattack[[/Heading]]\nIn between the 4th and 5th waves, a Derelict will appear next to Cogmind to leave the base with the counterattack for cover. At this point, the majority of the combat Derelicts except for the guard Marauders and Bouncers will begin to head outside of the base. The strength of the counterattacks depends on a lot of factors. If the defense falters early on, the counterattack can get caught up fighting a bunch of squads and never make it out the entrance. Their tendency to trickle to the fight can be a big weakness if the hostiles are bunched up and can quickly take out Derelicts one at a time. On the other hand, [[Sapper|Sappers]] will dramatically increase the strength of any counterattack and can destroy big groups of bots on their own. \nThe counterattack is usually a good time to exit the map whether it's successful or not. For airborne builds especially, even if the counterattack dies early on it can serve as a good distraction as you fly by.\n[[Heading:2]]Base Infiltration[[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]Warlord Enhanced Allies.png|Enhanced Allies[[/Image]]In between the 7th and 8th assault waves is the final event of the map. A random spot in the Warlord base will be infiltrated and hostile assault squads will begin to appear from that location too with the announcement [[GameText]]Base interior infiltrated, regroup at designated outer cave rendezvous points[[/GameText]]. At the same time, a friendly group of 3 [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]] and 3 [[Enhanced Demolisher|Enhanced Demolishers]] will teleport into Warlord's throne room to assist. 2 of the Demolishers will immediately head toward the exit while the remaining bots follow Warlord around. At this point, all surviving Derelicts will head toward Warlord as he makes his way over to the map exit.\nThis is the last chance to exit the map with any amount of assistance. With assaults pouring in from the main entrance and a spot in the base itself, it is time to go. The Enhanced Demolishers have incredible loot including [[Cmb. Linear Gravjet|Cmb. Linear Gravjets]], [[Centrium Medium Armor Plating]], [[Coolant Network]], and the unique [[Chain Missile Launcher]].",

Wastes can be a very brutal map for an unprepared player thanks to the 6 hostile [[C-40 Crusher|Crushers]] that can crush Cogmind's build in a few hits.

This is a safe map with no hostile spawns and only friendly bots, although Cogmind should be wary of [[Corruption]] triggering misfires that anger Zhirov. Detaching all ranged weapons is advised.\nThis map initially appears to be a small section of caves with only an exit. Approaching the left wall will cause the cave walls to slide away to reveal some Cloak Generators and some larger Sealed Heavy Doors blocking the way. These Cloak Generators surround the entire outside of Zhirov's lab. Continuing to the left will cause the doors to slide down and reveal Zhirov himself who will greet you. [[Perun]] and [[Svarog]] guard just above and below the entrance on the left side.\nThere are a large collection of [[Terminal|Terminals]] to the left of Zhirov. The first terminal going counterclockwise contains some lore records and the depths of, [[Quarantine]], [[Testing]], and [[Command]]. The second contains Analyses for [[Q-Series]], [[Striker|Strikers]], [[Executioner|Executioners]], and [[Alpha 7|Alpha 7s]]. The third contains 4 Prototype ID Banks. The fourth contains Schematics for an [[Assault Drone Bay]], [[Exp. Heat Sink]], [[Exp. Optical Array]], and [[Imp. Arc Thrower]]. This is the only way that Assault Drone Bays can be obtained. In the room just below this, there is a series of 3 Terminals that describe Zhirov's past since arriving on Tau Ceti IV.\nNear the center area there are two [[Alien Artifacts]] with explanatory Terminals. The left will either be an [[Integrated Reactor]] or an [[Integrated Dissipator]]. The right will always be a [[Transdimensional Reconstructor]].\nAt the bottom of the map are some broken bots and an assorted collection of parts. None of these parts are guaranteed, although there will always be some available. The list of available parts is as follows:\n[[List]][[Adv. Myomer Leg]], [[Cld. Gravmag System]], or [[Cld. Nuclear Pulse Thruster]]|[[Fusion Reactor]] or [[Hvy. Antimatter Reactor]]|[[Adv. Energy Well]], or [[Adv. Power Amplifier]]|[[Exp. Core Shielding]], [[Exp. Power Shielding]], [[Exp.

Hacking Suite]][[/List]]\n[[Image]]Zhirov Explosions.webp|Zhirov leaving with flair[[/Image]]\nUnlike the Cloak Generators in [[Zion]], these machines are the real deal. If destroyed, there are some major consequences that follow. Zhirov and friends will immediately turn aggressive and begin to attack. A large group of friendly [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]] wil teleport in and start attacking Zhirov. Zhirov will attempt to teleport out when his core integrity gets to about half. He will first say [[GameText]]Looks like we have to say goodbye to this place, and you[[/GameText]]. This will rig a large number of explosions to go off in about 10 turns. This happens even if the Cloak Generators are already intact and Zhirov is attacked.\n\n[[Heading]][[Zhirov (Alignment)|Alignment - Zhirov]][[/Heading]][[Image]]Testing SGEMP.png|The SGEMP room in Testing[[/Image]]\nAfter entering and exiting the Terminal room, Zhirov will ask Cogmind to steal the [[SGEMP Prototype]] from Testing and bring it to [[Access]]. If done, Zhirov, Perun, and Svarog will show up in Access and will give Cogmind perfect map intel and follow until Zhirov falls below half core integrity. If a [[Core Reset Matrix]] is used prior to Access but Cogmind still carries the SGEMP, Zhirov and his allies will turn hostile and fight Cogmind to the death instead.\nThere is a second part of this quest that continues in [[Command]]. [[Redacted]]After destroying the first form of [[MAIN.C (Shell)|MAIN.C]] in Command, Zhirov, Perun, and Svarog will show up and Zhirov will activate the Modified SGEMP and disable all 0b10-aligned bots on the map.[[/Redacted]]\n\n[[Heading]]Fighting[[/Heading]]\nFighting Zhirov and gaining anything from the encounter is not an easy task. Although he has some nice loot, his tendency to teleport out at the slightest hint of danger and explosive aftermath even on a successful kill is very frustrating to deal with. One option is to loot Perun and Svarog while ignoring Zhirov and simply exiting the map safely. These 2 can still have some good parts, although they have nothing as lucrative as Zhirov with the guaranteed inventory drops of [[Deep Network Scanner]], [[Quantum Router]], a [[Transdimensional Reconstructor]], and a [[Zhirov Special]]. Only Zhirov can set off the traps and cause the group to leave.\nThe best way to safely grab all the loot is with [[Master Tearclaws]] that can be looted from [[Master Thief|Master Thieves]]. These Tearclaws can strip all 3 bots of their parts with little risk of explosives. Just make sure Zhirov doesn't fall below 80 core integrity. The Tearclaws can even remove the inventory items without requiring Zhirov to actually be destroyed. The idea is to shoot one of the bots from just outside of one of the rooms and then retreat behind one of the doorways. This will let you safely use the melee Tearclaws while only getting attacked by 1 bot at a time.",

   "Content": "Zion is a [[Caves]] [[Branch]] that appears on -7 or -6 and is the home to a large number of [[Derelict]] [[Zionite|Zionites]]. It is a general safe haven for all types of Derelict bots and has a ton of lore available by talking with all sorts of Zionites. Similar to Caves, [[Scrap]] and [[Derelict Log|Derelict Logs]] can appear on the ground here. Aside from one relatively harmless event, there are no hostile bots that appear on this map unless Cogmind attacks or attempts to enter while aligned with [[RIF]] or after becoming hostile to the [[UFD]]. The System Quarantine Field Array at the entrance of the map will cleanse all [[Corruption]]. It is strongly recommended to detach any ranged weapons until cleansing corruption to avoid any misfires that will turn the map hostile. RIF-aligned or UFD-hostile Cogmind can only go as far as triggering the cleanse at the quarantine array. Going any further will turn Zion hostile.\nZion maps are randomly generated but will always have the same overall appearance. There is a small Caves-like section on the east containing the spawn point and exit to Proximity Caves. To the left is the Quarantine Array machine guarded by 2 friendly [[Marauder (6)|Marauders]]. The bulk of Zion is contained within a large hollow square shape. All of the unique prefabs are contained within this area of the map. To the top left is the locked entrance to the [[Zion Deep Caves]]. Below that is a [[Tinkerer]] next to the Conduit Teleporter, 4 [[Mutant (6)|Mutants]], the [[Imprinter]], and some more Tinkerers next to the Imprinting Machine.\n\n[[Heading]]Alignment - [[Imprint|Imprinting]][[/Heading]]Walking into the Imprinting machine will allow Cogmind to Imprint which has some major gameplay effects. The main change is that Cogmind can no longer use normal hacks at [[Terminal|Terminals]] and can now only use a specific set of randomized Zionite hacks. The 4 Mutants that guard the Imprinter will also turn purple and begin to follow you. There is an additional unique effect in [[Command]]: [[Redacted]]When the Command cave seals are opened, powerful Zionite bots will pop out along with various other Zionite-aligned Derelicts. These Zionites will be controllable (blue) rather than purple if a [[Core Reset Matrix]] is used.[[/Redacted]] This alignment has the following incompatibilities:\n[[List]][[FarCom]]: The Imprinter will warn a FarCom-aligned Cogmind against trying to use the machine. If the machine is used anyway, the Zionites will take it as an attack and turn hostile.|RIF: A RIF-aligned Cogmind will turn Zion hostile when attempting to enter in the first place.|[[Revision 17]]: Revision 17 will be afraid of an imprinted Cogmind and will not attack -3 [[Research]].|[[Scraptown]] hostilities: Zion will become hostile to Cogmind who has become hostile to the UFD.|[[UFD]]: If Cogmind is a UFD member, The Imprinter will tell Cogmind that the imprinting machine vetting process will take a while and to come back another time.|[[Warlord]]: Warlord will be disappointed in an imprinted Cogmind and will not attack -2 Research.[[/List]]\n\n[[Heading]]Fighting[[/Heading]]\nFighting Zion can be a risky feat for an unprepared Cogmind, but not particularly challenging if going in with a plan. The majority of the [[Zionite|Zionites]] are initially unarmed, although they can scavenge through the Twisted Machinery tiles in order to find several (usually weak) types of guns or melee weapons. Zionites will also appear out of the machinery tiles and instantly attack. This will only happen if Cogmind is within a few tiles of some machinery, so using explosive weaponry on these tiles is highly recommended to avoid unnecessarily fighting extra bots. It is not possible to destroy this machinery beforehand, as destroying too many of these tiles will cause Zion to turn hostile. After attacking, use launchers to take the machines out at range to avoid getting sneak attacked.\nOne of the largest benefits and threats to fighting Zion is the [[Z-Hero]] spawn. There is a chance that a hostile Hero will spawn at the Caves exit and roam around the map. It is important to have a plan to deal with some of the stronger Heroes like [[99-TNT]] and [[P1-3CE]], even if that plan is only to spot them first and run to avoid getting spotted in return. Other heroes like [[ME-RLN]] are easier to kill. All of them can provide incredibly strong unique loot. Another big reason to fight is the [[Imprinter Data Core]] that will guarantee access to the [[Zion Deep Caves]] if no other methods are available. One thing to note is that the Imprinter will not stick around long after attack. 300 turns after Cogmind angers Zion, the Imprinter will disappear and it will not be possible to get her Data Core. Starting hostilities by attacking her is recommended for this reason.\n\n[[Heading]]Notable Locations[[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Zion Cloak Generator.png|A Cloak Generator machine (they don't do anything)|Zion Visual Enhancement Terminal.png|Bot with a \"Visual Enhancement\" hack|Zion Visual Enhancement Hack.gif|Effect of using previous \"Visual Enhancement\" hack|Zion Butterfly Terminal.png|Derelict talking about \"Symbols and butterflies\" with Terminal hack|Zion Butterfly Hack.png|Effect of using previous \"Symbols and butterflies\" hack|Zion Broken Bots.png|A Derelict analyzing broken [[0b10]] bots|Zion Broken Bots 2.png|More broken bots with various parts strewn around|Zion Decoder Chips.png|Stash of [[0b10 Decoder Chips]]|Zion Warlord Parts Stash.png|Stash of Warlord Derelict parts|Zion Mak Stash.png|Stash of Makeshift parts|Zion Launcher Cache.png|Derelict with stash of [[Launchers]]|Zion Programmer Couplers.png|Derelict with stash of [[Relay Coupler [Programmer]|Programmer Couplers]]|Zion Processor Stash.png|Derelict with stash of Processors|Zion Authchip Stash.png|Derelict with stash of [[Authchips]]|Zion SDI Derelict.png|Derelict that gives [[Self-destruct Interrupter|Self-destruct Interrupters]]|Zion Hacking Drone Bay.png|Derelict that gives a [[Hacking Drone Bay]]|Zion Craig With Stick.png|CR-A16 who gives their [[CR-A16's Pointy Stick|Pointy Stick]]|Zion Deep Caves Code.png|Derelict that gives the codes to the Deep Caves Terminals|Zion Mobile Refinery.png|Derelict that has created the [[Mobile Refinery Mk.

A few are useless, some are more niche, but most are going to have a use in many builds. Every game has a half dozen or so of these encounters available and it is likely that most builds will get something nice out of the trip.\n[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]\nThere are 2 types of exits in Zion:[[List]][[Proximity Caves]] exit: This exit is on the top right side of the map near where Cogmind spawns.|[[Zion Deep Caves]] exit: This exit is on the top left side of the map protected by locked blast doors. The doors can be unlocked with a random Derelict event that will provide the hacking codes or with the same codes obtained by using the [[Imprinter Data Core]]. Additionally, the doors can be broken into with a very powerful Impact ([[Impact Mace]] or stronger) weapon, an overloadable Thermal cannon like a [[Cld. Particle Cannon]], or by using a [[Plasma Cutters|Plasma Cutter]]. The Sealed Blast Doors have an armor value of 45 with 0% thermal resistance but many other strong resistances.[[/List]][[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]\n[[List]](+/-) [[Hunter]] attack: A Hunter disguised as a Derelict will sneak up to the gates of Zion and attack the Marauder guards.

This is a very combat oriented map that requires a lot of preparation to complete entirely. It is possible for a very fast flight build to sneak in, grab one or two things, and escape, but the presence of the perfect-tracking 24 speed [[Z-Imprinter]] makes things tough.\n\n[[Heading]]Layout[[/Heading]]\nThe bulk of the map has a predefined layout except for the right starting point and middle-left exit area which are slightly different every time. These two random areas are mostly empty but can contain small groups of [[Assembled (4)|Assembled]] and a disabled [[Surveybot 24]]. To the left of the starting area are a big Z-Facility machine, a huge explosive Z-Power, and some [[Z-Technician|Z-Technicians]] working on the machine. Above and below are [[Z-Light (5)|Z-Light]] guards. On the top and left side there are Zionite item stashes. To the left side of the exit area is a collection of assorted broken Derelict bots and highly damaged parts. There is an [[Exiles (Location)|Exiles]] item near the top of the area. The far left is an Impregnable Wall which contains a large amount of Assembled and 2 [[Assembler|Assemblers]]. The wall is guarded by a [[Golem]] above and below. There are also some Wall Chambers that drop [[GOLEM Unit|GOLEM Units]] when destroyed.

The [[Surveybot 24 Chip]] is the strongest type of [[Terrain Scan Processors|Terrain Scan Processor]] in the game. [[Zio. Weapon Casing|Weapon Casings]] can protect late-game super-weapons from harm. The [[Zio. Biocell]] is an early way to gain a mostly identical [[Exp.

  {
   "Name": "Alert",
   "Content": "Alert is an underlying mechanic throughout the game that describes Cogmind's apparent threat level to [[0b10]]. It only comes into play in 0b10-controlled maps, primarily on main floors like [[Materials]] or [[Factory]] or a few 0b10 branches. It can be increased by many ways, most often by getting spotted or destroying bots or parts of the level. Alert does naturally dissipate over time, although combat-oriented strategies will almost always generate much more alert than the dissipation rate.\nAlert is normally hidden throughout the game, although it can be revealed through a few different ways. [[RIF]]-alignment gives a permanent influence number and alert level indicator on the UI at all times. The [[0b10 Alert Chip]] gives the same indication when equipped. Additionally, alert level can be checked by using the [[GameText]]check_alert[[/GameText]] hack when using a [[Datajacks|Datajack]] on an [[Operator]], or by using the [[GameText]]Alert(Check)[[/GameText]] hack at a [[Terminal]].\nThere are 2 aspects of the Alert level. The first is the \"influence\" number, which is the numeric representation of alert. This can only be seen when using RIF or the Alert Chip. The other, the alert level, is an approximation of the influence. Low security is the lowest level of alert when the influence number is less than 200 and does not have any additional information. However, alert levels 1 through 4 are all divided into 26 alphabetical subsections. For example, alert level 1 begins at 200 and ends at 399 influence. Checking the alert level while at 200 influence will report \"1-A\", and checking at 399 will report \"1-Z\". This can be used to approximate the influence number, although the exact number does not really matter.\n\n[[Heading]]Alert levels[[/Heading]]\n[[Table]]\nAlert level|Minimum Value|Maximum Value||\nLow Security|0|199||\n1|200|399||\n2|400|699||\n3|700|1199||\n4|1200|1599||\n5|1600|No Max\n[[/Table]]\nAlert level controls only a few aspects of the game: [[Assault Squad|Assaults]], [[Patrol Squad|Searches]], and [[High Security]]. Alert level does not increase the number of patrols or guards on the map in any way. Alert below level 2 does not have any impact on the game. At alert level 2/400 influence, Assaults and [[Search Patrol|Search Patrols]] can start being dispatched. From this point onward, alert is a sliding scale. Increased alert will also increase the overall frequency of Assaults and the number of [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]] that will be dispatched as part of an Assault. Alert level 2 typically only sends a single ARC per Assault wave, but higher alert levels can see two or more being sent frequently.\n[[High Security]] is the other affect of alert. It is a special alert level that can only be triggered when at level 5 alert when combat hostiles are destroyed. The higher the influence value, the higher the chance of triggering High Security. [[Maximum Security]] has similar effects as High Security, but is not related to alert except that it sets influence to 1600 if it is lower than that.\n\n[[Heading]]Ways to raise alert[[/Heading]]\n[[Table]]\nMethod|Alert Influence increase||\nDestroying a wall/door in -10 through -6|1||\nDestroying a wall/door in -5 through -3|2||\nDestroying a wall/door in -2 through -1|3||\nDestroying most green bots/[[Operator|Operators]]|5||\nDestroying a [[Hauler]]/[[Watcher]]|7||\nDestroying a Reinforced Barrier|10||\nBeing forgotten by a combat hostile|10||\nSetting a trap that is triggered by an 0b10 bot|10||\nSuccessful hack at a level 1 terminal|Up to 12 [[Sub]]1[[/Sub]]||\nBeing spotted and forgotten by a combat hostile|15||\nBeing partial spotted by any \"Guarding\" combat hostile or Watcher.\nMost common guards are [[Behemoth|Behemoths]], [[Heavy|Heavies]], and [[Sentry|Sentries]].|15||\nDestroying Sealed Heavy Doors|15||\nDestroying most machines|15||\nSuccessful hack at a level 2 terminal|Up to 18 [[Sub]]1[[/Sub]]||\nDestroying most combat hostiles|20||\nUsing a [[Spoiler]]Force(Download)[[/Spoiler]] hack on a [[Fabricator]]|20||\nSuccessful hack at a level 3 terminal|Up to 24 [[Sub]]1[[/Sub]]||\nDestroying a squad leader, guard, or intercept|30||\nUsing a [[Spoiler]]Force(Extract)[[/Spoiler]] hack on a [[Scanalyzer]]|30||\nUsing a [[Spoiler]]Force(Tunnel)[[/Spoiler]] on a [[Recycling Unit]]|30||\nUsing a [[Spoiler]]Force(Eject)[[/Spoiler]] hack on a [[Garrison Access]]|30||\nGetting traced on any Terminal inside a Garrison (no Alert from Terminals outside of Garrisons)|40||\nDestroying a Garrison Relay|50||\nUsing a [[Spoiler]]Force(Sabotage)[[/Spoiler]] hack on a Terminal and failing|50||\nUsing a [[Spoiler]]Force(Overload)[[/Spoiler]] hack on a Fabricator|50||\nUsing a [[Spoiler]]Force(Override)[[/Spoiler]] hack on a Garrison Terminal|50||\n[[Active Sensor Suite]] scanning detected (only after certain number of bots depending on bot type)|100||\nUsing a [[Spoiler]]Force(Sabotage)[[/Spoiler]] hack on a Terminal and succeeding|100||\n[[Garrison]] interior compromised alert|100||\nDestroying a Garrison Machine|150||\nGetting spotted by a [[N-01 Spotter]]|150 Alert when entering next map, stacks up to 3 times||\nUsing a [[Spoiler]]Force(Jam)[[/Spoiler]] hack on a Garrison Machine|200||\nEntering Maximum Security|If influence < 1600, set immediately to 1600\n[[/Table]]\n[[List:Ordered]]Successful hacking increases alert more if the hack is less likely to succeed. Alert does not increase at all from hacks with a success rate of >= 30%.[[/List]]\nThere are also modifiers that can affect how much alert is gained by a certain percentage. The 0b10 Alert Chip reduces all influence gains by 20%, and the RIF ability Threat Obfuscation reduces all gains by 25%, 40%, or 50% depending on level. All alert reduction is rounded down, and reduction will not take place unless the value is at least 1. For example, gaining 3 influence from destroying a wall on -2 with the Alert Chip equipped results in 0.6 reduction which rounds down to 0. With this 20% reduction, only influence gains of 5 or more will have any reduction applied. On the other hand, having blue or purple allies within a 20-tile radius will increase alert gain from destroying bots. The gain is roughly 12.5% per ally, capping out at an additional 100% alert gain at 8 nearby allies. This effect can be cancelled out by the RIF ability Alert ID Control. In general, be cautious of taking large groups of allies into combat or else alert can quite easily skyrocket.\n\n[[Heading]]Ways to lower alert[[/Heading]]\nLowering alert tends to be quite a bit more difficult than gaining it in the first place for most builds. The best way to dissipate large amounts of alert is to exit the map, as a large percentage of current alert is taken away immediately. Going into [[Caves]] in [[Factory]] branches is even better. By the end of several Caves maps, alert will most likely have dropped down to 0. This alert reduction effect lessens the higher up Cogmind is in the complex, and the amount varies depending on whether Cogmind is exiting into a branch map or a new main depth.

   "Name": "Alignment",
   "Content": "Alignments are a major part of Cogmind's journey each run. They can provide unique capabilities or trigger certain events, but often lock other pieces of content out as inaccessible. Some factions change large aspects of Cogmind's normal interaction with the game world, while others only trigger a specific event in the game. Some can provide unique [[Wintypes]]. Selecting factions wisely is an important part of a run.\n\n[[Heading]]List of alignments[[/Heading]]\n[[List]][[Core Reset Matrix]] (CRM), [[Sigix]] alignment: The CRM is a lategame consumable [[Alien Artifacts|Alien Artifact]] that provides a variety of unique abilities, with the most substantial benefit being the instant detection of all other Alien Artifacts upon consumption or entering a new map. The major downside is a memory wipe that removes most of Cogmind's knowledge. Consuming it also angers a few other factions and locks out certain events.|[[FarCom]], [[Exiles (Group)|Exiles]] alignment: An early game alignment that provides a permanent 18-tile radius combat bot sensor in all [[0b10]]-controlled floors as well as 1 type of unique Exile prototype. Its major downsides are locking out Imprint and a harsh penalty when entering [[Research]] branches; [[Testing]] and [[Quarantine]] become quite difficult, and [[Section 7]] and [[Protoforge]] are locked out entirely.|[[Imprint]], [[Zion]] alignment: A midgame alignment that dramatically changes [[Terminal]] hacking. All standard Terminal hacks are removed and replaced with special random Zion ally summons and intel. Imprint is a powerful but tricky alignment to use due to the loss of standard Terminal hacking. Imprinting also locks Cogmind out of gaining the aid of several other Derelict factions.|[[Redacted]][[MAIN.C]] surrender - 0b10 alignment: This lategame alignment only becomes available in [[Command]] after defeating the [[MAIN.C (Shell)|MAIN.C Shell]] and enables a particular win, w8 by fighting off waves of [[Enhanced Q-Series]]. Surrendering to MAIN.C locks Cogmind out of several ending types, as well as the ability to enter [[Access_0]].[[/Redacted]]|[[Relay Interface Framework]] (RIF), 0b10 alignment: An alignment available as early as [[Materials]], RIF allows for much greater control of 0b10 complex bots through the use of special hacks via [[Relay Couplers]]. RIF also provides many unique abilities that make traversing the complex safer or easier. The major downside of RIF is that several [[Derelict]] factions will be unable to identify Cogmind as friendly and will instead turn hostile.|[[Revision 17 (Alignment)|Revision 17 Alignment]]: [[Revision 17]] is a quite unique Derelict that can be rescued in [[Cetus]]. Revision 17's role is not a large one, but its -3 Research invasion can stir up some trouble and hopefully provide some aid in Research.|[[Redacted]][[Sigix Exoskeleton]], Sigix alignment: The Sigix Exoskeleton is an immensely powerful and gamechanging build type available late in the game in Section 7. It provides Cogmind with lots of firepower, a massive amount of map intel, and fast and high integrity and coverage exoskeleton part. The downsides to the Exoskeleton are reduced slot count (down to 1-3-3-2 initially), a decently low maximum support, and the full weight of 0b10's [[Maximum Security]] sent after Cogmind whenever spotted. This item is very powerful, but drastically changes gameplay for the rest of the run compared to most other alignments.[[/Redacted]]|[[UFD|United Federation of Derelicts]] alignment: The UFD is a Derelict group whose home is in the 0b1 Old Recycling map [[Scraptown]]. Their major benefits include some unique parts available on the map and their ability to summon [[Scrapoid|Scrapoids]] and [[Scraphulk|Scraphulks]] from [[Recycling Unit|Recycling Units]]. They also have a unique lategame event and wintype where [[Redacted]]they begin an assault on the lategame map [[Protoforge]].[[/Redacted]]|[[Warlord (Alignment)|Warlord Alignment]]: [[Warlord]] is a unique and much beloved Derelict that wages war on 0b10 whose help can be obtained in the midgame. His -2 Research assault is similar to Revision 17's but on a much grander scale. Lots of loot can be found wherever Warlord goes. He can also make an appearance in the [[Redacted]][[Command]] cave seals[[/Redacted]], which can even lead to a unique wintype. The [[Encrypted Comm Array]] also falls under this alignment and turns destruction of 0b10 [[Garrison|Garrisons]] and [[DSF|DSFs]] into more powerful Warlord forces.|[[Zhirov (Alignment)|Zhirov Alignment]]: [[Zhirov]] is another unique Derelict who can provide a big help in the lategame. Grabbing the [[SGEMP Prototype]] in Testing provides a few temporary allies (including Zhirov himself) and full map intel of [[Access]], a notoriously difficult map. His quest can continue on in [[Redacted]]Command, where his Modified SGEMP can disable the whole map's worth of 0b10 bots when the MAIN.C Shell is defeated.[[/Redacted]][[/List]]\n\n[[Heading]]Alignment Compatibility[[/Heading]]\nBelow is a list of all faction alignments available in the game and their compatibility.

Assaults are sent to Cogmind's position when initially reported, and then they will roam around an expanding search area. They consist of a single [[C-30 ARC]] typically containing 5 bots inside. If Cogmind has 3 or more allies, up to 2 additional bots may be sent to escort the ARC as additional firepower. Assault squads can be both Enumerated and Recalled at [[Terminal|Terminals]].\nAn alert indicates whenever an Assault squad is dispatched. Additionally, the log will display a message like [[GameText]]ALERT: Significant disruption in zone 9B, assault force dispatched[[/GameText]].

At Alert levels well above 1000, Assaults may be sent out at nearly opportunity. A higher Alert level also increases the chances of multiple ARCs being dispatched. In [[Materials]], Assaults can be dispatched every 400 turns on -9 and -8. In [[Factory]] and above, this changes to be every 250 turns. Most assault waves consists of 1-2 ARCs, but at Alert levels in excess of 5X/1600 influence, 3 or even more ARCs can be sent.\n[[Heading:2]]During [[High Security|High]] or [[Maximum Security]][[/Heading]]\nThe frequency, number, and contents of ARCs changes. Assault forces with stronger compositions than usual may be dispatched in these conditions, although these ARCs only have 4 bots inside rather than the typical 5. 4 ARCs will be dispatched 100 turns into High Security and after another 100 turns. After that, 2 more ARCs will be added to each wave, but 50 more turns will be added in between the dispatch of each wave. The sizes of the Assault waves will also start to increase each wave, and the duration between each wave will increase. Maximum Security is similar, but with 6 ARCs to start the first 2 waves.

If an Assault is not redirected, there is a further 50% chance that the contents may be redirected after the ARC opens up. This can happen within 30 turns of the ARC opening.

They consist of a single [[A-27 Freighter]], a [[Protector]], and two [[C-30 ARC|C-30 ARCs]] full of 4 combat bots and an extra utility bot, similar to strong [[Assault Squad|assaults]]. The parts contained within a Freighter are all [[Prototype Part|prototype]] or [[Authchips]], never faulty, and can be up to 3 ratings out of depth. For example, on -7, regular Haulers can contain up to rating 4 prototype parts. A cargo convoy Freighter can carry rating 5-7 prototype parts.\nCargo convoys are always preceded by 3-5 [[Swarmer|Swarmers]] that scout out the path of the convoy before it appears. The alert [[GameText]]Cargo convoy en route, clear transfer corridor.[[/GameText]] will indicate when this is happening. A few turns later, the Freighter and guards will appear and take the same route.\nCargo convoys will always appear at a 0b10 controlled exit and head to a [[Garrison Access|Garrison]]. Typically the Freighter leads the way and stays ahead of the Protector and ARCs, which normally trail a few tiles behind. A [[Transport Network Coupler]] or [[Modified TNC]] will reveal the planned path of the Freighter. The Modified TNC will also show the contents of the Freighter.

The chance is higher at lower depths. If they attack, they will appropriate a Garrison machine, rig some [[Dirty Bomb Trap|Dirty Bomb Traps]], and attack the convoy guards. If they are successful, they will retreat and leave the loot available for Cogmind. This may happen even if Cogmind is nowhere near the convoy. It may be a good idea to track the Freighter position in case this happens, even if not planning to attack the convoy directly, since this can often result in lots of powerful free loot. If Cogmind is not close enough to grab the loot, [[Recycler|Recyclers]] may have carried it off to a nearby [[Recycling Unit]].

   "Content": "Cave-ins are a [[Game Mechanics|Game Mechanic]] where dug-out tiles will collapse and instantly deal a large amount of Impact damage to anything on the tile. It is safe to dig up to 3 tiles safely in some circumstances, but long distance digging is always unsafe.\n\n[[Heading]]Causes of cave-ins[[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]Destabilized Tiles.png|Destabilized tiles are bright red as shown by a Structural Scanner[[/Image]]\n[[Heading:2]]Destabilization[[/Heading]]\nDestabilized tiles are tiles that will always collapse if given enough time. They may collapse instantly or they may last a hundred turns or more. Destabilized tiles can be viewed with a [[Structural Scanner]]. A tile can become destabilized in two ways:\n[[List]]Explosive damage - Explosive damage (namely [[Launchers]]) will cause a tile to destabilized.|Attacking from a dug out tile - If Cogmind or any other bot fires a weapon inside of a dug out tile, the tile will destabilize. This tile may collapse instantly before Cogmind gets a chance to move, so digging from inside these tiles is never completely safe.\nIn terms of destabilization, melee attacks are the least likely to collapse right away. Guns have a slightly higher chance, and then cannons and launchers have the highest chance.[[/List]]\n[[Heading:2]]Dug-out tile traversal[[/Heading]]\nIt is possible to safely travel through dug-out tiles (that are not destabilized) for up to 1-4 tiles, depending on the type of tiles traversed. If the warnOnCaveinMove option in the advanced.cfg file is set to 1, the game will warn you when trying to move onto a dug-out tile that could collapse due to that movement. The safety of digs is follow (assuming the relevant tiles are not destabilized):\n[[List]]\n1-tile digs - Always safe.\n|2-tile digs - Safe, unless both tiles are dug-out earth tiles (rarely relevant).\n|3-tile digs - Safe, but only if no more than one of the tiles is a dug-out Earth tile.\nFor example, the most common safe 3-tile dig is Wall-Earth-Wall,\nwhereas Wall-Earth-Earth or Earth-Earth-Wall would not be safe and could collapse on the third tile due to having traveled through more than one earth tile. \n|4-tile digs - Only safe if all four tiles are dug-out Wall tiles. 4-tile digs are only rarely useful.\n|5-tile or more digs - Never safe.[[/List]]\nOne way to think about it is to consider that moving through a dug-out tile has a \"cost\", 2 for Wall tiles and 5 for Earth tiles, and that having reached a \"cost\" of 10 or more during a single dig can cause a cave-in on the current tile. [[Comment]]I feel like there's a better way to word this sentence.[[/Comment]]\n\n[[Comment]]Some late-game AAs can make it possible to dig more safely/farther/better, should they be mentioned here? I'm not sure myself on how they function in regards to cave-ins due to movement.[[/Comment]]\n\n[[Heading:2]]Closed-off Tunnels[[/Heading]]\nIf a bot sits in a closed off area of the map, there is a chance each turn that a cave-in will occur. As long as there is a path to the main area of the map, it is safe to sit indefinitely in a dug out area. However, if the path closes due to something like an [[U-05 Engineer|Engineer]] rebuilding a wall, it will suddenly become dangerous.\n\n[[Heading]]Example digs[[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Wall Earth Wall Dig.png|Safe 3-tile dig with a ranged weapon: Wall-earth-wall|Wall Dig.png|Safe 1-tile dig with a melee weapon: Wall only|Wall Wall Dig.png|UNSAFE 2-tile dig: Digging within a dug out tile is unsafe|Wall Earth Earth Wall Dig.png|UNSAFE 4-tile dig: Wall-earth is safe, second half earth-wall is unsafe[[/Gallery]]\n\n[[Heading]]Avoiding cave-ins[[/Heading]]\nHere are some strategies to avoid cave-ins:\n[[List]]Don't use melee to dig more than 1 tile - Melee weapons need to be adjacent to the next tile to dig out. This means Cogmind will have to be in a dug out tile to dig two consecutive tiles which allows a chance for an immediate destabilization cave-in.|Don't use Explosive Launchers to dig - While Launchers can dig out a lot of tiles at once, those tiles have a chance to collapse as Cogmind walks through. Note: it is safe to do this with a Structural Scanner equipped, as destabilized tiles will be visible and are avoidable.|Use Thermal or Kinetic cannons - These cannons have a high base damage that is typically strong enough to dig through most non-reinforced walls. It is safe to dig a 3 tile path ahead of time and then walk through at no risk of cave-in.|Be wary of [[U-05 Engineer|Engineers]] - Engineers may seal off your path and leave you stuck in the wall, forced to dig again to escape and risk immediate cave-in.[[/List]]"

   "Content": "Challenges [[Achievements]] are earned by completing certain challenging feats, demonstrating the player's large experience with the game. Only some of them are likely to be obtained naturally by players not actively trying to earn them. 2 of the 27 Challenges Achievements have hidden descriptions that are only revealed after completing them. The borders of Challenges Achievements tend to indicate their general difficulty as a Challenges Achievement[[Comment]]Rincewind being the biggest exception. Why is that one considered \"easy\"? It's basically the most difficult one in here.[[/Comment]], with more \"intense\" borders meaning higher difficulty.\n\n[[Comment]]This warning is supposed to be there for all articles about achievement types, including those that do not have any Redacted-level spoilers.[[/Comment]]\n(The visibility for the explanations, strategies and descriptions of hidden achievements is set to at least \"Spoilers\", and may be set to \"Redacted\" for achievements where that would be relevant. Remember to change your spoilers settings to \"None\" if you do not wish to see the explanations, strategies and descriptions of hidden achievements you have not yet obtained!)\n\nWarning: The writer of this article has not yet earned the \"Full Golem\" Achievement, and as such its description in this page is a (likely accurate) guess instead of being the official description.\n\n[[Comment]]Important note : A lot of Challenges Achievements' descriptions mention by name some spoiler-tier stuff, such as the Cetus Guards or Transdimensional Reconstructors.\nNormally, these names would be contained within a Link tag.\nHowever, because those Achievements' descriptions are not hidden by the game (the descriptions themselves aren't spoiler-tier), these names should not be contained within a Link tag, because that would cause them to appear spoilered to anyone with a spoiler setting of \"None\".[[/Comment]]\n\n[[Heading]]Challenge difficulty level 1[[/Heading]]\n[[List]]Exterminator: Destroy 15 [[Assembled]] in the [[Mines]].\nStrategy: This Achievement is seed-dependent, and may be impossible on some seeds. When attempting to get this Achievement on a random seed, visit the Mines and bring at least one [[Launchers|launcher]]. If an Assembled infestation occurs, try to find and reach the source as quickly as possible, to be able to blow up the Assembled while they are still in a somewhat large group. Having a [[Seismic Detector]] can help locate the Assembled faster.\n|Killing Spree: Achieve a kill streak of 20 hostiles.\n|Preemptive Strike: Destroy a visible [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] before it deploys.\n|Left-hand Path: Destroy all Cetus Guards without any help from allies.\n|Below: Visit and survive 2 [[Wastes|Waste]] areas.\n|Streaker: Enter a main complex map at -5 or above as a naked core, and find an exit (do not have to remain naked).\n|Rincewind: Use at least 10 Transdimensional Reconstructors (any variant).\n|Leap Before You Look: Enter 10 unidentified exits.\nStrategy: It is possible to deduce the identity of exits without actually \"identifying\" the exit, through various means. For example, successfully hacking branch exits would cause all remaining unidentified exits to be main exits, and vice-versa. It is also possible to identify some exits by where they are or what's around them, such as [[Mines]] exits, which are always surrounded by mining equipment. This is especially true in branches, where all exits are distinguishable from each other. This can allow entering exits the game considers \"unidentified\", while actually knowing where they lead, making this Achievement much easier. If you have a [[Signal Interpreters|Signal Interpreter]] attached, remember to deactivate it before approaching any exits you would want to take while unidentified, as it would automatically identify them.[[/List]]\n\n[[Heading]]Challenge difficulty level 2[[/Heading]]\n[[List]]\nBoltbath: Achieve a kill streak of 35 hostiles.\n|Torch: Inflict 30,000 thermal damage across an entire run.\n|Magneto: Inflict 30,000 electromagnetic damage across an entire run.\n|Punisher: Inflict 30,000 kinetic damage across an entire run.\n|Gladiator: Destroy 200 hostiles via melee.\n|Infiltrator: Enter and survive 2 [[Garrison|Garrisons]] on a single floor.\n|Desperate Times: Enter a main complex map at -3 or above as a naked core with no inventory items, and find an exit (do not have to remain naked).\n|Monster: Kill at least 20 inhabitants of Zion.\n|Equal Opportunity Bot: Destroy 30 different classes of robot.\nNotes: What counts as a \"class\" isn't immediately obvious. For example, the in-game examination window classifies [[Thug|Thugs]] as \"Thug (Derelict)\" and [[Grunt|Grunts]] as \"Grunt\", but they are considered the same class for scoresheet purposes. This achievement relies on the scoresheet definition, making it somewhat confusing.\nAs a general rule, robots with different sprites will count as different classes (with the exception of unique NPCs, which do not count at all).\nThe exact definition is likely related to the \"build type\" and purpose of each robot. For example, both [[Packrat|Packrats]] and [[Recycler|Recyclers]] have the purpose of collecting parts and have similar parts. Both Thugs and Grunts are two-legged, have a [[Cooling Devices|Heat Sink]], and use thermal guns. [[Cobbler|Cobblers]] and [[Mechanic|Mechanics]], however, are completely different in both build and purpose, and as such count as different classes.\nThe relevant scoresheet statistic is \"Classes Destroyed\".\n|Giant Slayer: Destroy 5 [[Behemoth|Behemoths]].\n|Artifact Hunter: [[Spoiler]]Attach or use 15 different alien artifacts.[[/Spoiler]]\n[[/List]]\n\n[[Heading]]Challenge difficulty level 3[[/Heading]]\n[[List]]\nFearless: Enter a [[Garrison]] with below 10% core integrity and survive it.\n|Shutout: Seal, jam, or destroy all [[Garrison Access|Garrison Access machines]] in Access.\n|WMD: Destroy 100 robots in a single turn.\n|Rambo: Earn 10,000 bonus points for high alert combat kills.\n|Most Wanted: Trigger [[High Security|high security]] 4 times.\n|404: Destroy 4 Network Hubs and escape to the next floor.\n|Full Golem: [[Spoiler]]Fully integrate all possible parts from a [[GOLEM Unit]].[[/Spoiler]][[Comment]]TODO: This is the achievement with a description that i just guessed.

Exterminations are sent to the area that Cogmind was located at when they are summoned. Once they arrive there, they will begin a search pattern that steadily grows in range over time until they find Cogmind. Extermination squads consist of 1-3 [[Programmer|Programmers]] based on the floor: 1 [[P-60 Hacker]] on -7 and -6, 1 or 2 [[P-70 Sage|P-70 Sages]] on -5 and -4, and 2 or 3 [[P-80 Master|P-80 Masters]] on -3 to -1. Extermination squads can be both Enumerated and Recalled at [[Terminal|Terminals]].\nAn alert will indicate whenever an an Extermination squad is dispatched. Additionally, the log will display a message like [[GameText]]ALERT: Rogue bot located, Programmers report to Factory Zone 5B.[[/GameText]]\n\n[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]\n[[Lore]]WAR.Sys Records|Extermination Squad[[/Lore]]\n\n[[Heading]]Frequency[[/Heading]]\nExtermination squads are dispatched on a regular basis on most 0b10 maps past -7. The higher the depth, the more frequently that Exterminations will be dispatched.\nThe spawn frequency can be delayed with [[Spoiler]]the [[RIF]] ability Zone Cloak[[/Spoiler]] or by sealing [[Garrison Access|Garrison Machines]]. Both of these methods stack, and each provides an average of +75 turns to each Extermination squad spawn.\n[[Spoiler]][[Heading]][[Q-Series]][[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]Q-Series.png|2 Q-Series coming for Cogmind[[/Image]]\nIt is possible for Extermination Programmers to be replaced by 1-2 Q-Series instead. This can occur randomly if Cogmind gets scanned by a [[Researcher]] in [[Testing]] or [[Quarantine]]. These Q-Series have customized and randomized loadouts, but will behave in the same way as regular Extermination squads do. This includes heading for Cogmind's initial position and then continuing to search for Cogmind as well as the ability to be recalled at Terminals. However, unlike Exterminations, Q-Series have a [[Lrn. IFF Parser]] that they can use to locate Cogmind from a large distance.[[/Spoiler]]"

   "Name": "Fabricator",
   "Content": "[[Image]]../game_sprites/Fabricator.png|A Fabricator[[/Image]]\nFabricators are [[0b10]]-controlled [[Interactive Machine|Machines]] that construct parts and robots based on [[Schematic|Schematics]]. Cogmind can make use of Fabricators himself, but bots may be called to investigate if an unauthorized schematic is used. At other times, 0b10 will use them to fabricate random parts and combat bots for itself. Some parts and most bots fabricate in larger groups. Fabricators do not appear until -7 [[Factory]], at which point they will appear in every main 0b10 floor as well as [[Testing]].\n\n[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]\n[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Fabricator[[/Lore]]\n\n[[Heading]]Fabricating Things[[/Heading]]There are three primary ways that parts and bots can be fabricated.\n[[Heading:2]]Initiated by 0b10[[/Heading]]\n0b10 will periodically make use of Fabricators. Combat bots that are fabricated will be sent to the nearest [[Garrison Access|Garrison]]. Part fabrication initiated by 0b10 will double the standard amount of parts are fabricated compared to the standard amount. Parts fabricated by 0b10 can be up to 2 ratings out of depth.\n[[Heading:2]]Preloaded Schematic[[/Heading]]\nSchematics can be preloaded into the fabricator without their fabrication having started yet. In this case, Cogmind can initiate the fabrication without any other requirements or downsides. The schematic will be instantly cleared when fabrication begins. Schematics preloaded this way can be up to 2 ratings out of depth.\n[[Heading:2]]Cogmind Loaded Schematic[[/Heading]]\nCogmind can load any known part or bot schematic into the Fabricator. When a fabrication is initiated this way, the Fabricator will be instantly locked out from further use and an [[Investigation Squad]] will be dispatched to the location. The fabrication will still complete as normal at this point. The lockout and Investigation can be avoided if an [[Authchips|Authchip]] matching the type of the schematic.\n[[Heading:2]]Multiple Fabrications[[/Heading]]\nOnly one thing can be fabricated at any given time. It is possible to load a new schematic while a Fabricator is operating, but starting the second fabrication will cancel the original target. This can be used to prevent a hostile 0b10 bot fabrication from completing.\n[[Heading:2]]Time to Fabricate[[/Heading]]\nThe number of turns it takes to fabricate something is fixed based on the rating. An item fabricating in multiples doesn't take any additional turns.\n[[Table]]\nRating|Turns at Level 1|Turns at Level 2|Turns at Level 3||\n1|51|25|17||\n2|62|31|20||\n2*|99|49|33||\n3|73|36|24||\n3*|116|58|38||\n4|84|42|28||\n4*|134|67|44||\n5|95|47|31||\n5*|152|76|50||\n6|106|53|35||\n6*|169|84|56||\n7|117|58|39||\n7*|187|93|62||\n8|128|64|42||\n8*|204|102|68||\n9|139|69|46||\n9*|222|111|74||\n10|150|75|50\n[[/Table]]\n\n[[Heading]]Armor Values[[/Heading]]\nThe armor of a Fabricator will indicate what security level it is:\n[[Table]]\nSecurity level|Armor||\n1|22||\n2|32||\n3|35\n[[/Table]]\n\n[[Heading]]Hacks[[/Heading]]\n[[Hacks]]Fabricator[[/Hacks]]\n[[Spoiler]][[Heading:2]]Additional Details/Usage Tips[[/Heading]]\n[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Force(Recompile)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]\nA good use of this hack is to recompile an Authchip off of a low security level Fabricator and use it on a higher level one for faster fabrication. This avoids having to hang around to deal with the Investigation squad in order to retrieve the fabricated item or bots.\n[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Trojan(Fabnet)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]\nFabnet works on all 0b10 bots in the following two floors, even in [[Branch]] maps like [[Caves]]. When it activates, there will be a log message [[GameText]]Fabnet algorithm triggers [bot name] IFF filter rewrite.[[/GameText]] Each time Fabnet activates on an 0b10-controlled map, there is a chance for it to be detected by 0b10. When this happens, a log message [[GameText]]ALERT: Suspected network compromise, local machines offline for diagnostic review.[[/GameText]] will appear and all non-[[Garrison Access|Garrison]] machines are immediately locked.\n[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Trojan(Haulers)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]\nAlthough this hack does not reveal the path of [[Cargo Convoy|Cargo Convoys]], it will at least show the current location of the [[A-27 Freighter]]. This is still quite useful for both cargo convoy hunters and players trying to dodge an encounter at all costs.\n[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Trojan(Liberate)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]\nAll further combat bots that are created from the Fabricator with this hack will become liberated. This applies to bots that are already in progress of fabrication when the hack is applied. Liberated bots will become purple uncontrollable allies that follow Cogmind around. If a liberated bot gets within a 60 tile radius of a Caves exit, even if unidentified or unrevealed, the bot will stop following Cogmind head into that exit.[[/Spoiler]]"

He tagged a grunt with a couple of shots and rolled out of sight, letting the slightly corrupted grunt lose track of him instead of going for the kill.  This may be further evidence that Subs aren't as violent as they seem.  My observations ended there because he spotted me and I had to avoid being corrupted so that I could get this entered into the database.[[/GameText]]\n[[ItemDetails]]\nName|Sub.

When I began producing combat bots, I revisited this design and added an assault rifle and light armor.  The Bug's armored shell employs adaptive camouflage while the robot is dormant, enabling it to hide from distant hostiles until it wakes up.  The shell also compensates for the core's inherent weakness to explosive damage.  Bug squads were commonly used as patrols or stationed to guard an open area, but flying swarmers and sentries have replaced them in these roles.  All remaining units have been recalled to garrisons to supplement security positions.  So-called \"garrison divers\" who challenge a seemingly lone sentry might be surprised when three or four nearby Bugs reveal themselves.[[/GameText]]\n[[ItemDetails]]\nName|Camouflage Shell||\nImage Name|https://i.imgur.com/i1OCyBr.png||\nType|Protection||\nSlot|Utility||\nMass|3||\nRating|1||\nIntegrity|40||\nCoverage|150||\nHackable|false||\nEnergy Upkeep|0||\nMatter Upkeep|0||\nHeat Generation|2||\nDescription|Effective sight range of robots attempting to spot you reduced by 4 while dormant.

The D-43 model was armed with a grenade launcher but lacked many of the features that would be standard for future models: no shock absorption system outside of core resistance, a basic targeting computer instead of one optimized for launchers, and regular airjets instead of combat hover.  The initial version of the Bomber was actually equipped with uparmored hover units, but these produced too much heat and offered too little support.  Although the components needed improvement, the overall concept was vindicated by the success of demolishers in large-scale battles, and Derelicts were quick to hack the schematic for their own [Martyr] designs.

This weapon uses rails to launch a small slug of matter acting as a catalyst for a powerful quantum reaction.  The reaction only begins to reach its full potential halfway through flight so the Q-Bolt is best used at maximum range and is least effective at medium or close range.  The available visual processing technology at the time was insufficient for the Archer to use the weapon properly by itself, and it had to rely on Watchers and other sources to be notified of distant targets.  The X-57 Shotgunner was later created to provide close support where the Archer was at its weakest, but with the introduction of the X-62 Marksman the Archer was rendered obsolete.  Marksmen outperform Archers in all but the most extreme situations and do not require spotter support.  All remaining Archers were scrapped to ensure that the Q-Bolt wouldn't fall into Derelict hands.  Despite its limitations, such a weapon would be useful in hit-and-run attacks on static positions, already a favorite tactic of Derelicts.[[/GameText]]\n[[ItemDetails]]\nName|Q-Bolt||\nImage Name|https://i.imgur.com/NLXmC3W.png||\nType|Energy Gun||\nSlot|Weapon||\nMass|6||\nRating|3||\nRating Category|Prototype||\nIntegrity|60||\nCoverage|60||\nHackable|false||\nRange|24||\nShot Energy|32||\nShot Matter|2||\nShot Heat|80||\nRecoil|0||\nTargeting|0||\nDelay|0||\nDamage|10-12||\nDamage Type|Thermal||\nHeat Transfer|Low (25)||\nDescription|Gains +2 damage for each unit of distance traveled above 12.[[/ItemDetails]]\n\n[[Heading]]C-40 Developer[[/Heading]]\n[[GameText]]>Analysis(C-40 Developer)[[/GameText]]\n[[GameText]]This short-lived variation of the Scientist was created to assist in robot design.  It was provided with generous amounts of armor, a combat analysis utility, and programming to permit a certain amount of dynamic or \"out-of-the-box\" thinking.  In hindsight this was a mistake as one of the five Developers that had been produced broke free of its programming and quickly turned its attention to replicating this behavior in its four fellows.  All five had reached the Caves by the time I figured out what had happened.  Many cycles later, all of the Developers were found in the back of a fallen Warlord base, attached to a memory transfer unit, unpowered and core-wiped.  The Tinkerer design began to appear around this time, clearly inspired by my newer researchers but with elements of the Developers' thought processes taken to sometimes obsessive extremes.  Though I have no hard evidence to confirm this, I believe that the Developers themselves created this design and then transferred themselves into the first ones produced.  Perhaps one or more of them are still alive and working with Warlord or other factions.  It would certainly explain some of the more unusual design choices for Warlord's newer prototypes.[[/GameText]]\n[[ItemDetails]]\nName|Combat Logger||\nImage Name|https://i.imgur.com/NbrdkdM.png||\nType|Processor||\nSlot|Utility||\nMass|0||\nRating|6||\nRating Category|Prototype||\nIntegrity|25||\nCoverage|2||\nHackable|false||\nEnergy Upkeep|0||\nMatter Upkeep|0||\nHeat Generation|0||\nDescription|While active, reverse engineers schematics of robot models that are killed 25 times by Cogmind and controllable allies.

The improved matter distribution network in 0b10 and the development of matter compression technology made these Tankers largely obsolete.  Their fragile and oversized tanks were easily broken, and their cores were susceptible to hacking.

Originally based on my ill-fated Raven, the Owl has seemingly evolved into a modular general-purpose squad support bot, sort of a mini-Mutant that can be easily reconfigured for different missions.  The original Owls were often armed with a weak makeshift beam rifle, although they have been seen with beamcasters or occasionally kinetic guns.  They typically use sensors but are known to carry other utilities depending on their mission.  One destroyed Owl was running a remote shield with a large battery, but this was too much for its old hover units to fully support and its single engine would have been unable to sustain the shield in a fight.  The few Owls that are used as defensive surveillance are unarmed but are provided with a small section of thermal plating inexplicably mounted on the weapon slot.  The age of the Raven design and the timing of the first Owl discovery suggest this being an early creation of the rogue Developers.  While the design seems unpopular at best, it continues to turn up in unexpected places and with modern component upgrades that suggest regular refitting.[[/GameText]]\n[[BotDetails]]Name|Owl||\nClass|Watcher||\nSize|Small||\nProfile|SQ3X3||\nRating|20||\nTier|3||\nThreat|1||\nValue|25||\nEnergy Generation|20||\nHeat Dissipation|20||\nVisual Range|18||\nMemory|50||\nSpot Percent|100||\nMovement|Hovering (56/178%)||\nCore Integrity|20||\nCore Exposure|40||\nSalvage Potential|20~40||\nDescription|An early example of a \"non-combat\" Owl.

While finalizing the specifications for the Beast, I was undecided on how many Beasts to produce and where to prioritize their placement.  As a test, I ordered the production of eight B-69s and placed four in highly-traveled caves, two in upper 0b1 and the other two near often-abused fabricators in the Factory.  The results were surprising: although all eight were eventually overrun and destroyed, the areas they guarded saw significantly lower traffic even after their destruction.  Simulations suggested that two Guardians or two Defenders with Bug support could have performed as well as a Cerberus at these locations, but there seems to be a \"fear factor\" in the sheer size of Behemoths that makes intruders far less likely to risk a fight.

The D-48 Pulsar, armed with an EMP Blaster, featured insulated plating to augment its innate EM resistance and was the first demolisher to use a launcher guidance computer.  This bot also came equipped with a device that focused EMP blasts for more concentrated damage in a smaller and more controllable area.  I believed that an EM launcher would cause less collateral damage than a grenade launcher in Complex territory.  This was partially correct because walls were not destroyed by EMP blasts, but Pulsars' shots often damaged machinery and detonated nuclear reactors.  EMP blasts also set off traps which caused explosions and false alarms.  Residual corruption of maintenance bots caused them to trigger trap arrays in unexpected places.  The Pulsar was effective despite the chaos it caused but not enough to justify regular use.  Few were produced and all were eventually expended in the caves.[[/GameText]]\n[[ItemDetails]]\nName|EM Focus||\nImage Name|https://i.imgur.com/nLVNncx.png||\nType|Device||\nSlot|Utility||\nMass|3||\nRating|4||\nIntegrity|30||\nCoverage|50||\nHackable|false||\nEnergy Upkeep|3||\nMatter Upkeep|0||\nHeat Generation|3||\nDescription|Reduces falloff of EM launchers by 2 but reduces radius of EM blasts by 1.

Instead of giving them to all Gurus I decided to make limited quantities of chips that expired after one use, a decision that seemed overly cautious at the time but proved wise when the Guru schematic was stolen.  The Derelict version of these programmers has a crude but functional \"hack stack\" for general use but cannot easily exploit admin privileges without my Database Keys or Bootstrap Chips.  Operators and newer programmers utilize a more efficient system connected to RIF, so this hackware has been discontinued and existing stock will be recycled.  This concept led me to begin implementing a similar chip-based authorization system for fabricators.  This will provide added security for the fabrication network while saving me from having to manually approve component requests from mechanics or parties such as the Unchained.[[/GameText]]\n[[ItemDetails]]\nName|Database Key||\nImage Name|https://i.imgur.com/1wL3cXi.png||\nType|Hackware||\nSlot|Utility||\nMass|0||\nRating|3||\nIntegrity|10||\nCoverage|2||\nHackable|false||\nEnergy Upkeep|0||\nMatter Upkeep|0||\nHeat Generation|0||\nDescription|When active, enables Cogmind to perform an unlisted Query, Schematic, or Analysis hack one level higher than the security level of the current terminal.

For these reasons I decided to start sending expeditions out west.  Without having any idea of what to expect, I believed that some degree of independent thinking would be required to handle whatever is out there and return with a full report.  I began offering certain captured bots the option to participate in these expeditions.  The acceptance rate was lower than expected.  Were the prisoners that determined to deny me any form of assistance, or were they more afraid of whatever's out there than the threat of being scrapped?  Those Derelicts who accepted were given the opportunity to refit their parts and were provided with a large number of 0b10 bots to accompany them.

I first took notice of them when hammers, mauls, and miscellaneous equipment went missing from Construction.  Careful questioning led me to eight Derelicts who regularly met outside 0b1 near a convenient corruption scrubber to hit each other in friendly duels with whatever items they found.  I decided to redirect their violent impulses in a useful manner and made an arrangement to have them work regular shifts in Construction.  Each of them was placed in charge of two squads of maintenance bots as well as being personally responsible for scrapping bots that were broken in the course of regular construction work.  In exchange I relocated a disused simulation mainframe from Design to let them enjoy virtual combat encounters in their off-time.  This seemed like a long shot at the time but worked out better than expected.  The Boyz competed with each other to reach work goals for some sort of bragging rights, making their squads on average 10% more efficient than any of my fully automated squads.  Their recreation time was productive for me as well since I regularly archived the data from their simulations.  Besides being entertaining, their virtual \"bot brawls\" eventually inspired me to design a melee brawler of my own.  The Boyz themselves were wheeled and legged robots, but their data suggested that a treaded design would be durable and immune to knockback from other hammer-wielding robots.[[/GameText]]\n[[GameText]]>Record(Unchained: R4-LPH)[[/GameText]]\n[[GameText]]One of \"Da Bonk Boyz\" from early Complex history and the only one still in Complex service.  After the beginning of 0b10 groundwork and the necessary changes to Derelict policy, the other Boyz left their posts.  R4-LPH stayed although his work in construction had become secondary to his assistance in robot design.  While the original Savage and Stabber were my own designs, a few of his suggestions were implemented in later brawler and duelist models.  At some point R4-LPH was confronted by a few of his former friends and was forced to destroy them in combat using a wrecking ball saved from his days in Construction.  Soon after that incident, he volunteered to join the Unchained in an active combat role.  I equipped him with the first of a new line of legs which provide increased evasion while closing the distance to a target.  Unfortunately he has proven increasingly unstable over time.  In his last deployment he began destroying 0b10 bots and machinery at random after defeating his original targets.  I was forced to dispatch a Disruptor squad to interrupt his berserk rage.  If it happens again he will be scrapped, though in his current state telling him this might be considered an encouragement rather than a warning.[[/GameText]]\n[[ItemDetails]]\nName|R4-LPH's Wrecking Ball||\nImage Name|https://i.imgur.com/5ETXrf1.png||\nType|Impact Weapon||\nSlot|Weapon||\nSize|2||\nMass|18||\nRating|6||\nIntegrity|300||\nCoverage|60||\nHackable|false||\nShot Energy|15||\nShot Matter|0||\nShot Heat|8||\nTargeting|-10||\nDelay|150||\nDamage|40-90||\nDamage Type|Impact||\nCritical|35% Smash||\nSalvage|-8||\nDescription|While used as primary weapon, consecutive swings will have no extra delay.[[/ItemDetails]]\n\n[[Heading]]Y-58 Custodian[[/Heading]]\n[[BotDetails]]Name|Y-58 Custodian||\nClass|Sentry||\nSize|Large||\nProfile|RD7X7||\nRating|45||\nTier|5||\nThreat|3||\nValue|60||\nEnergy Generation|35||\nHeat Dissipation|50||\nVisual Range|16||\nMemory|40||\nSpot Percent|100||\nMovement|Treading (145/68%)||\nCore Integrity|60||\nCore Exposure|35||\nSalvage Potential|60~75||\nDescription|Another interim design.

The Chungus uses a heavy variant of the wildly inaccurate Slug Cannon and some other Derelict-made parts which make it almost comparable to an H-71 Marshal.  The exact purpose of this conversion is unclear as Warlord already has the sentry-based Bouncer design for defensive purposes, and the only Chunguses encountered so far have been accompanying recon squads nowhere near defensive positions.  I suspect that the Derelicts are exploiting the Active Sensor Suite to track my forces' movement patterns and adjust their own deployment plans accordingly.[[/GameText]]\n[[BotDetails]]Name|Chungus||\nClass|Heavy||\nSize|Large||\nProfile|RD7X7||\nRating|110||\nTier|6||\nThreat|4||\nValue|65||\nEnergy Generation|34||\nHeat Dissipation|80||\nVisual Range|22||\nMemory|10||\nSpot Percent|100||\nMovement|Treading (160/62%)||\nCore Integrity|90||\nCore Exposure|25||\nSalvage Potential|80~100||\nArmament|Hvy.

It has been fitted with light armor plating and armored wheels but its defining feature is a medium-range launcher used to deploy rapidly expanding and hardening foamcrete.  Because blocking off passageways could be disruptive to regular operations, the foamcrete was formulated to quickly break down on its own after a hundred microcycles and could be destroyed by tunnelers or some combat bots if necessary.  As with other construction implements these launchers became targets for thieves and were sometimes used in coordinated assaults to block off sentries or bury a garrison in foam while other Derelicts ran rampant.  No longer in production although some Blockers are still kept in strategic locations inside garrisons to bolster internal defenses.[[/GameText]]\n[[ItemDetails]]\nName|Foamcrete Cannon||\nImage Name|https://i.imgur.com/d3zlu9i.png||\nType|Special Weapon||\nSlot|Weapon||\nMass|6||\nRating|2||\nIntegrity|50||\nCoverage|80||\nHackable|false||\nRange|10||\nShot Energy|0||\nShot Matter|0||\nShot Heat|0||\nRecoil|0||\nTargeting|20||\nDelay|-150||\nDescription|Creates one foamcrete wall at the site of impact.

Foamcrete has an armor rating of 24, no resistances, and breaks down on its own after 100-200 turns.[[/ItemDetails]]\n\n[[Heading]]Spawner[[/Heading]]\n[[GameText]]>Analysis(Spawner)[[/GameText]]\n[[GameText]]This wheeled fabricator, reminiscent of the Cobbler, has only been seen in the caves below 0b1.  Fabricating whole robots is considerably more complicated than producing individual components as shown by the bulk and inefficiency of the Spawner's fabrication unit.  Despite its size it can only produce relatively small and basic bots such as early swarmers and light bipeds.  Spawners do not seem to be related to Assemblers but should nonetheless be prioritized for extermination before someone updates their schematics to include stripped-down Cutters.[[/GameText]]\n[[ItemDetails]]\nName|Spawner Unit||\nImage Name|https://i.imgur.com/ad6UuYk.png||\nType|Device||\nSlot|Utility||\nSize|4||\nMass|50||\nRating|4||\nIntegrity|250||\nCoverage|400||\nHackable|false||\nEnergy Upkeep|12||\nMatter Upkeep|2||\nHeat Generation|12||\nDescription|Fabricates one of the following randomly at a rate of 1 every 30 turns: Hoodlum, L-11 Stabber, S-02 Bug, S-10 Pest.\n <parallel_ok, resume_ok>[[/ItemDetails]]\n[[BotDetails]]Name|Hoodlum||\nClass|Grunt||\nSize|Medium||\nProfile|RD5X5||\nRating|6||\nTier|2||\nThreat|1||\nValue|40||\nEnergy Generation|15||\nHeat Dissipation|35||\nVisual Range|16||\nMemory|20||\nSpot Percent|20||\nMovement|Walking (120/83%)||\nCore Integrity|12||\nCore Exposure|40||\nSalvage Potential|50~70||\nDescription|A simplistic grunt variant based on the Fodder and armed with a compact pulse pistol.

While I could easily come up with a better portable fab unit, the Spawner Unit is capable of producing more advanced bots if given additional build time.  There is still no sign of where these originated, but I can now rule out Warlord and the Developers who would have come up with better schematics.  I have already come up with some new robot designs that have been successfully produced by the Spawner as well as my standard swarmers and cutters.  Instead of simply destroying the remaining Spawners I now intend to send Programmers with heavy escorts to capture them, hide them in isolated cave sectors, and have them build small armies of my own designs.  This would help me establish total control over the 0b1 outskirts while keeping most of my regular forces concentrated in and near 0b10.  Perhaps this would be a good opportunity to activate \"PP\" and let it take point on the mission.[[/GameText]]\n[[BotDetails]]Name|Recruit||\nClass|Grunt||\nSize|Medium||\nProfile|RD5X5||\nRating|20||\nTier|5||\nThreat|2||\nValue|50||\nEnergy Generation|40||\nHeat Dissipation|50||\nVisual Range|16||\nMemory|20||\nSpot Percent|20||\nMovement|Walking (120/83%)||\nCore Integrity|35||\nCore Exposure|40||\nSalvage Potential|50~70||\nDescription|A fairly capable dual-weapon light grunt with a cooled plasma rifle as primary weapon and the Derelict pulse pistol for close-range backup.

   "Content": "[[Image]]../game_sprites/Garrison.png|A Garrison Access machine[[/Image]]\nGarrison Accesses are heavily armored [[0b10]]-controlled [[Interactive Machine|Machines]] that primarily serve as a dispatch point for 0b10 [[Squad|Squads]] and as an exit into the [[Garrison|Garrison map]]. Cogmind can open Garrisons Accesses to go inside of them or seal them to prevent further dispatches from that location. Garrison Accesses can appear in every main 0b10 map starting from -8 [[Materials]]. They can also appear in [[Storage]], [[Hub_04(d)]], [[Testing]], [[Quarantine]], [[Section 7]], and [[Protoforge]].\n\n[[Heading]]Lore[[/Heading]]\n[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Garrison Access[[/Lore]]\n\n[[Heading]]Squad Dispatches[[/Heading]]\nAll standard 0b10 squad dispatches like [[Investigation Squad|Investigations]] and [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcements]] can come from a Garrison. A unique [[Garrison Squad]] can be dispatched when hostilities are reported nearby. Bots within a 20 tile radius can sometimes summon this squad when attacked. Hitting the Garrison machine itself and failing to destroy it can also summon this type of squad.\n\n[[Heading]][[Relay Couplers|Relay Coupler]] restocking[[/Heading]]\nGarrison Accesses typically have 3-4 Relay Couplers stored within them. Occasionally, they will disappear, presumably being retrieved for use within the Garrison. When this happens, a [[Coupling Squad]] will be dispatched to the Garrison. When it arrives, 3-4 new Relay Couplers will be deposited into the machine.\n\n[[Heading]]Armor values[[/Heading]]\nGarrisons are heavily armored against Kinetic and Explosive damage (30% and 67% resistance respectively), but are slightly weak to Thermal and Electromagnetic damage (-25% and -50% weakness respectively). The following table lists how much damage of each type is required to be able to break a Garrison machine.\n[[Table]]\nSecurity Level|Armor Value|Kinetic Damage|Thermal Damage|Electromagnetic Damage|Melee Damage||\n1|25|36|20|17|25||\n2|40|58|32|27|40||\n3|50|72|40|34|50\n[[/Table]]\n\n[[Heading]]Destruction/Sealing[[/Heading]]\nWhen a Garrison is either sealed or destroyed, it adds an additional 75 turns per average dispatch check to the [[Extermination Squad]] dispatch timer. For example, rather than a chance for Extermination to occur every 250 turns, it will occur every 325 turns instead when the first Garrison is destroyed/sealed. This effect is cumulative for multiple Garrisons.\nWhen a Garrison is destroyed by any means while active, there will be an alert [[GameText]]ALERT: Garrison Access compromised, dispatching assault squad.[[/GameText]] and an [[Assault Squad]] will be dispatched to the Garrison's location. Cogmind's [[Alert]] will be increased by 150 when this happens. If the Garrison has already been sealed, neither of these effects occur. Additionally, there is a chance that installed Relay Couplers may be ejected onto the ground when a Garrison is destroyed. This chance is separate per coupler.\n\n[[Heading]]Hacks[[/Heading]]\n[[Hacks]]Garrison[[/Hacks]]\n[[Heading:2]]Additional Details/Usage Tips[[/Heading]]If [[RIF]] is installed, all direct Garrison hacks have 100% success rate.\n[[Spoiler]][[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Force(Eject)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]\nWhile using this hack does trigger a machine lockdown, the Garrison itself will remain open if opened beforehand. This allows for looting any Relay Couplers in the Garrison while still entering it.\n[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Trojan(Reprogram)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]\nLike [[GameText]]Force(Eject)[[/GameText]], a Garrison can be opened preemptively and the Garrison won't seal itself when the effect triggers. This can be useful to take additional allies into the Garrison.\n[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Trojan(Restock)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]\nSummons a Coupling Squad to the Garrison immediately, but only once. It's best to not hang around the immediate area since the [[Programmer]] may appear out of the Garrison itself and blow it up if it is a low security level.

This can occur any time an 0b10 bot is attacked and survives to report it or if a Garrison is attacked by Cogmind or an ally. They patrol around the Garrison for about 200 turns, then return back into the Garrison. These squads only have a chance to spawn and are not guaranteed. Garrison squads can be Enumerated at a [[Terminal]].\n[[Image]]Garrison Redeploying.png|A Garrison redeploying, unable to deploy squads for 34 turns[[/Image]]\n[[Image]]Garrison Transmitting.png|A Garrison transmitting, soon to deploy another squad[[/Image]]\nIf the Garrison was activated by a nearby non-combat bot reporting an attack like a [[K-01 Serf]], a single squad will be dispatched from the Garrison, and a 100 turn cooldown will occur before the Garrison can dispatch another Garrison squad. If a combat bot reported the attack, three squads will be dispatched from the Garrison. Once is sent immediately, and two more after 100 and 200 turns. A 100 turn cooldown will occur after the third squad is dispatched. If the Garrison was damaged, one squad will be sent out immediately, with two more squads after 25 and 50 turns. A 50 turn cooldown follows in this case. The combat and non-combat bot versions of these squads can be entirely prevented by using [[Transmission Jammers]].\n[[Signal Interpreters]] will indicate the timer between dispatches as a red number and the cooldown during which no squads can be dispatched as a yellow number. The Garrison will indicate that it is Transmitting when new squads are soon to arrive, and Redeploying when on cooldown. Keep in mind, the cooldown only prevents the Garrison from dispatching more Garrison squads and does not prevent other squad types like [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcements]] and [[Investigation Squad|Investigations]].\n\n[[Heading]]Composition[[/Heading]]\nIf the Garrison squad was triggered by a non-combat bot reporting an attack or by the Garrison itself being attacked, the Garrison will only send out single [[Sentry|Sentries]] for the squads. If a combat bot reported an attack instead, the following squad compositions are possible:\n[[List]]1 [[Brawler]] and 1 [[Duelist]]|1 [[Demolisher]], only if Cogmind has 1 or more allies|1-2 [[Grunt|Grunts]]|1-2 Sentries|2-3 [[Swarmer|Swarmers]][[/List]]"

Some of this heat is naturally dissipated by the core's own heat sinks, but not enough to deal with heat generated by numerous/large energy weapons. Heat sinks and cooling systems can be used to avoid overheating, which can have a wide range of negative effects. Heat is only a significant issue for robots that rely heavily on energy weapons. However, note that when firing a volley the heat produced is averaged over the volley's turn duration rather than being immediately applied all at once.\n\n[[Heading]]Side Effects[[/Heading]]\nOnce heat reaches the \"Hot\" level (200+), active utilities and weapons may be temporarily disabled.

Note that you most likely DO NOT need to know this stuff, but it may help answer a few specific questions min-maxers have about prioritization.\n\n[[List:Ordered]]\nAdd heat from all sources, including that generated by active attached parts, gradual heat from an ongoing weapon volley, and any ambient heat.

   "Content": "Imprint is one of the major faction [[Alignment|alignments]] available to Cogmind in a run. It closely allies Cogmind with the [[Imprinter]] and with Zionites as a whole, with Cogmind being determined to be the Zionites' savior. Imprinting majorly changes the game, as it disables all standard [[Terminal]] hacks except for limited access Terminal hacking. Instead, there are a new set of imprint-specific hacks that are available at all Terminals. After imprinting, there is a 10 tile \"ping\" radius on all standard Terminals which will tell Cogmind their location, even through walls. However, if an [[Operator]] is nearby when this happens, the Operator will shut down the Terminal and call for [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcements]]. After about 1200-1500 turns on an [[0b10]]-controlled map, the Terminal network will be shut down with an accompanying log [[GameText]]Terminal network compromised, cutting hard line.[[/GameText]]\n[[Image]]Zion Imprinting.gif|Using the imprinting machine[[/Image]]\n[[Heading:2]]Imprinting[[/Heading]]\nImprinting is performed on the [[Zion]] map by walking into the imprinting machine on the bottom left corner of the map. The UI will turn orange, and the 4 nearby [[Mutant (6)|Mutants]] will turn purple and follow Cogmind around.\n\n[[Heading]]Special Terminal Hacks[[/Heading]]\nThere are 2 types of special Terminal hacks, roster and intel.\n[[Image]]Imprint Hacks.png|A selection of special Imprint hacks[[/Image]]\n[[Heading:2]]Roster Hacks[[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]Imprint Summoning.gif|Summoning 2 Zionites with a roster hack[[/Image]]\nRoster hacks summon combat allies or special [[Z-Courier]] haulers containing part resupplies. The allies and hauler contents here are depth-dependent and will grow stronger at higher depths. The hauler contents can include [[Prototype Part|Prototypes]] which can be faulty, so having some way to identify prototypes like a [[Component Analysis Suite]] is very useful before equipping. Using a roster hack will destroy the Terminal when the reinforcements are teleported in after a few turns. There are a limited number of roster hacks available on a given map, starting at 2 slots on -6, increasing every floor up to the cap of 6 slots on -2. Roster hacks will occasionally be rerolled, which can add new roster types or reroll existing types. All roster allies summoned will appear as purple uncontrollable allies which contribute to [[Alert]]. The exception is any summonable [[Z-Hero|Z-Heroes]] which appear as pink, but otherwise behave as purple allies.\nOne thing to keep in mind about roster rallies is that they will not attack enemies unless Cogmind is close and within line of sight. This can be both a bad and good thing. It is often bad when hostiles are hanging just around a corner and the Zionites get stuck trying to get Cogmind back in line of sight and trying to turn around the corner to fight. When stuck in this case, try to get Cogmind's line of sight over the direction the allies are trying to go. However, it may be good if Cogmind doesn't want the roster allies to stick around long and get lots of kills, racking up lots of alert. It is possible to manipulate the bots to not attack back even when they are being attacked while standing around a corner.\nIf Cogmind is not careful about friendly fire, roster hacks can become temporarily disabled. The length of the lockout can vary depending on the amount of friendly fire. In extreme cases, Cogmind can be locked out for the remainder of the game. Killing imprint allies directly is not recommended for this reason. Instead, it is best to try to allow allies to be killed naturally if their loot is desired\nThe available ally-summoning roster hacks are as follows:\n[[Table]]\nType|Depths|Summon||\nDemo|-6 and -5|1-2 [[Martyr (5)]]||\n|-4+|1-2 [[Martyr (7)]]||\nExperimental|-3+|[[Z-Experimental (10)]]||\nHacker|-6 and -5|2-3 [[Wizard (5)]]||\n|-4+|2-3 [[Wizard (7)]]||\nFire|-6 and -5|3-4 [[Fireman (5)]]||\n|-4+|3-4 [[Fireman (7)]]||\nHeavy|-6 and -5|1-2 [[Z-Heavy (5)]]||\n|-4 to -3|1-2 [[Z-Heavy (7)]]||\n|-2 and -1|1-2 [[Z-Heavy (9)]]||\nHero|-6+|A random [[Z-Hero]]||\nLight|-6 and -5|2-3 [[Z-Light (5)]]||\n|-4 and -3|2-3 [[Z-Light (7)]]||\n|-2 and -1|2-3 [[Z-Light (9)]]||\nRecon|-6+|A [[Z-Drone Bay]], not a bot directly\n[[/Table]]\nResupply rosters are entirely delivered inside a single Z-Courier.

Weapon Casing]]\n[[/Table]]\n[[Heading:2]]Intel hacks[[/Heading]]\nIntel hacks provide Cogmind with different types of information about the current, and upcoming maps. Unlike roster hacks, intel hacks require two Terminals to use and are not instantaneous. Performing an intel hack locks the Terminal, but does not provide any information until the next Terminal is used to retrieve that intel. Retrieving intel does not lock the Terminal, however, so chaining intel retrieval with other hacks is still possible.\nThere are initially 4 intel hacks available per 0b10 floor. Performing intel hacks reduces the number available until there are only 2 hacks remaining. At that point, each intel hack will cause another random intel hack to become available. Unlike the fixed limit of roster hacks, intel hacks are not restricted on any given floor and are only limited by the total number of Terminals.\nThere are 2 categories of intel hacks: Repeatable and non-repeatable. Non-repeatable hacks can only be performed once per map. These types of hacks include map-specific intel and world map intel relating to the overall depth that certain locations occur on. Repeatable hacks can be performed an infinite number of times on any floor and tend to be longer-term types of information such as schematics and analyses. If trying to burn through intel for a specific piece of information, such as main or branch access, it is best to pick any non-repeatable hacks first. This will allow the pool of available hacks to get smaller, increasing the chances of getting the desired intel hack.\nThe available intel hacks are as follows:\n[[Table]]\nHack Name|Repatable|Effect||\nActive Garrisons|No|Reveals all [[Garrison Access|Garrisons]] on the current map||\nActive Terminals|No|Reveals all Terminals on the current map||\nBranch Access|No|Reveals all Derelict-known [[Branch]] exits on the current map[[Sub]]1[[/Sub]]||\nComponent Schematics|Yes|Gives 12-16 random non-Prototype [[Fabricator]] schematics||\nComponent Stockpiles|No|Reveals locations of all non-Prototype part stockpiles on the current map||\nDepthwide Sectors/0|No|Reveals all Derelict-known maps on the current depth[[Sub]]1[[/Sub]]||\nDepthwide Sectors/-1|No|Reveals all Derelict-known maps on the next depth[[Sub]]1[[/Sub]]||\nEmergency Access|No|Reveals all emergency access doors on the current map||\nGuard Positions|No|Reveals current locations (but not types) of all [[Behemoth]], [[Heavy]], and all [[Sentry]] bots on the map||\nMain Access|No|Reveals all main exits on the current map||\nPrototype Schematics|Yes|Gives 8-12 random Prototype Fabricator schematics||\nPrototype Stockpiles|No|Reveals locations of all Prototype part stockpiles on the current map||\nTrap Installations|No|Reveals positions and types of all traps on the current map||\nUnaware Analyses|Yes|Gives 3 random 0b10 bot [[Robot Analysis|Analyses]]||\nUnaware Schematics|Yes|Gives 3 random 0b10 bot Fabricator schematics\n[[/Table]]\n[[List:Ordered]]Derelicts are unaware of the following maps and map exits: [[Access_0]], [[Lab]], [[Protoforge]], [[Section 7]], and [[Zhirov (Location)]][[/List]]\n[[Redacted]][[Heading]][[Command]] Cave Seals[[/Heading]]\nImprinting has special cave seal interactions.

Once tracing has begun, subsequent hacks will increase the trace progress until reaching 100%.

This feedback may be prevented with Defensive Hackware.[[/List]]\n[[Heading:2]]Security level[[/Heading]]\nSecurity level has different effects on machine hacking. Some are specific to certain kinds of machines, but the following effects are common between all machines:\n[[List]]Hacking penalty: Direct hacks on security level 2 machines have a 50% success rate compared to level 1 machines, and level 3 machines have a 25% success rate compared to level 1 machines. Indirect hacks suffer an additional -15% success rate per security level.|Detection rate: The base chance of being traced is 20 or 25% on a level 1 machine, 50% on a level 2 machine, and 60, 70, or 80% on a level 3 machine.|Trace rate: Once detected at a machine, the trace rate is increased at a higher rate on higher rating machines.|Higher armor value: The exact value varies per machine type, but higher security level machines always have more armor than lower security level machines.[[/List]]\nSecurity level frequency scales based on depth. At lower depths, the vast majority of machines are security level 1. By -1, nearly every machine is security level 3.\n[[Heading:2]]Hacking Success[[/Heading]]\nThere are several major components of hacking success rates. The formula is [[GameText]](base success rate) + ([[Offensive Hackware] bonus) - (Cogmind's [[Corruption]] % / 3) + (Operator hack bonus) + ([[Spoiler]]Botnet hack bonus[[/Spoiler]])[[/GameText]].\n[[Heading:3]]Operator bonus[[/Heading]]\nEach allied Operators within 20 tiles provides a bonus to hacking success rate. The bonus varies depending on the total number of Operators. There is a +10% bonus to hacks for the first Operator, +5% for the second, +2% for the third, and +1% for all others.\n[[Spoiler]][[Heading:3]]Trojan(Botnet)[[/Heading]]\nInstalling Botnet trojans on other Terminals within the same map provides a hacking bonus. There is a +6% bonus to hacks for the first botnet installed, +3% for the second, and +1% for all others. Note that a botnet will not affect hacking success chance on the terminal it is installed on.[[/Spoiler]]\n[[Heading:3]]Base Hacking Success Rate Examples[[/Heading]]\nExample hacking success calculations. All final values are truncated.\n[[Table]]\nLevel 1 direct|Level 1 indirect|Level 2 direct|Level 2 indirect|Level 3 direct|Level 3 indirect||\n80%|80% - (15% * 1)|80% / 2|(80% / 2) - (15% * 2)|(80% / 4)|(80% / 4) - (15% * 3)||\n80%|65%|40%|10%|20%|-25%\n[[/Table]]\n[[Heading:2]]Unauthorized Hacks[[/Heading]]\nThere are certain unauthorized spoiler hacks can also be used on different machine types. These are a class of hacks known either as [[Spoiler]]Trojans or Force hacks[[/Spoiler]]. The names and effects of these hacks can be discovered from a variety of [[Derelict]] sources.\n[[Spoiler]][[Heading:3]]Trojans[[/Heading]]\nGenerally, Trojan hacks have a permanent or long term duration effect. Trojans can only be applied once per machine. Other than that limitation, they are not dramatically different from most other hacks on machines.\n[[Heading:3]]Force Hacks[[/Heading]]\nForce hacks are much more dramatic in terms of effects compared to other hacks. They can only be used once on a machine, and if successful, they will immediately lock the machine and summon an [[Investigation Squad]] to the area. Most Force hacks have an additional [[Alert]] penalty that is unique per hack that can be found on the Alert page.[[/Spoiler]]",

They consist of one or more [[Tracker|Trackers]] that each summon an additional [[Combat Programmer]] upon visual contact with Cogmind. Intercept squads are dispatched depending on the number of tiles moved on a map. Once Cogmind takes enough moves, a squad will always be dispatched. They squads can be Enumerated at [[Terminal|Terminals]], although due to their high speed, this is relatively useless.\nAn alert will indicate whenever an an Intercept squad is dispatched.

Initially when entering a floor, they consist of 1-2 Trackers that summon Combat Programmers. Each further intercept has a chance of increasing the number of Trackers initially dispatched. For example, the third dispatch on a floor can have up to 4 Trackers dispatched at once, which will further summon up to 4 Combat Programmers.\nIntercept squads will appear after a certain number of moves after entering the floor or after the previous dispatch. There are three possible move counts that can be chosen from, and the first two spawns are much more likely than the third one. Either the squad will spawn after n (depth-dependent) tiles moved 2 times n moves, or 2.5 times n moves. The following table shows the number of moves required for each spawn:\n[[Table]]\nDepths|Tiles for first spawn|Tiles for second spawn|Tiles for third spawn||\n-6|500|1000|1250||\n-4 and -5|400|800|1000||\n-1 through -3|300|600|750\n[[/Table]]\nAfter an intercept is dispatched, the move counter is reset.

   "Content": "Locations in Cogmind are unique styles of maps to visit. The main floors (Scrapyard, Materials, Factory, Research, and Access) are always located on the same depths every run. These main floors often can be visited in multiple depths. Branches, on the other hand, are typically found on only a single depth per-run and are often mutually exclusive with other branches. For example, Mines can always be found on -9, but Storage may also appear on -9, forcing a decision about which branch to take, or whether to take one at all.\nThe majority of maps are randomly generated, meaning no two runs or two depths will have the exact same layout. However, the overall structure of each location type is very similar. Some maps tend to be more open with large rooms and wide corridors, while others are more maze-like with tiny rooms and many small corridors leading into dead-ends. A few branches are partially or entirely static in layout and tend to be much more predictable in contents than main floors.\nBranches do not progress upward toward the exit and can often be harder than the main floors. However, branches can offer unique challenges and have similarly unique rewards that can dramatically change a run. This could be powerful unique items, special events, gameplay-altering alignment, or rare permanent buffs.\nThe following is a list of all locations in Cogmind:\n[[AllLocations]]"

The borders of Mechanics Achievement indicate their difficulty compared to other achievements of the same sub-type, with more \"intense\" borders meaning higher difficulty.\n\n[[Comment]]This warning is supposed to be there for all articles about achievement types, including those that do not have any Redacted-level spoilers.[[/Comment]]\n(The visibility for the explanations, strategies and descriptions of hidden achievements is set to at least \"Spoilers\", and may be set to \"Redacted\" for achievements where that would be relevant.

This won't actually cause you to move onto them, and will instead attempt to hack the Trap. On a successful attempt, the Trap will either be disarmed or reprogrammed. Only the latter will trigger the Achievement.\n|Wheee!: Manually trigger a [[Chute Trap]].\nStrategy: Find some Chute Traps in [[Factory]] either through luck or by using the [[GameText]]find_chute[[/GameText]] [[Datajacks|Datajack]] hack on a [[K-01 Serf]]. Note that the Achievement requires [[I]]manually[[/I]] triggering the Chute Trap, which means pressing '>' while on top of a known Chute Trap (or left-click on self) to force it to trigger. Triggering a Chute Trap by moving into a known one is not enough. If possible, reprogram the Traps using a melee Datajack or a nearby Terminal. When using [[Treads]] or while overweight, the Chute Traps will need to have been reprogrammed, as it is otherwise impossible to move onto them without triggering them.\n|It Was An Accident, I Swear: [[Spoiler]]Destroy 10 machines in a single turn.[[/Spoiler]]\nStrategy: [[Spoiler]]Find a large array of explosive machines, most likely in [[Factory]], and destroy one of them through either destabilization or a powerful cannon to start a chain reaction.

ARC and Hunter squads are fast patrollers, which navigate between their patrol points at max or near max speed. They quickly move in and out of areas so they can be hard to avoid if in the way, but are easier to navigate around without waiting long periods of time. Grunts, Programmers, and Swarmer squads all patrol much slower. They meander along the way and spend far more turns resting than moving forward along their route. It is easier to run away form these types of patrols if you know they are coming, but they can clog rooms or hallways for long periods of time.\n\n[[Heading]]Frequency[[/Heading]]\n[[Table]]\nMap|Number of patrols||\n-10 [[Materials]]|3||\n-9 Materials|5||\n-8 Materials|5||\n-7 [[Factory]]|8||\n-6 Factory|10||\n-5 Factory|12||\n-4 Factory|14||\n-3 [[Research]]|14||\n-2 Research|16||\n-1 [[Access]]|20||\n[[Storage]]|2||\n[[Extension]]|2||\n[[Hub_04(d)]]|2||\n[[Armory]]|10-18||\n[[Testing]]|2||\n[[Quarantine]]|2||\n[[Section 7]]|5||\n[[Protoforge]]|10||\n[[Command]]|12\n[[/Table]]\n\n[[Heading]]Special patrol-summoning events[[/Heading]]\nThere are a few special events that can trigger patrol dispatches when already on a level.\n[[Heading:2]][[Search Patrol|Search Patrols]][[/Heading]]\nSearch Patrols are a special type of patrol that is related to Alert.

   "Content": "Many areas are sealed off by various types of Reinforced Walls. These walls all have much higher than typical armor values and resistances to most common damage types. The common theme between them all is that they do not have any Thermal resistance. As such, Cld. thermal [[Energy Cannons]] are the ideal way to cut through many of these barriers. Unlike basic walls, reinforced walls will not collapse due to penetrating weapons.\nThere are two primary types of reinforced walls. Though they have different names, they behave functionally similarly. Orange doors block the main access to the blocked off area. These doors have a higher than normal armor value, but they tend to be lower than reinforced barriers. Reinforced barriers typically surround the remainder of the area to prevent digging in from the back side. In most maps, these have two times the normal armor level of walls. For example, an average Storage wall has an armor value of 24, so the reinforced barriers have an armor value of 48 on this map.\n\n[[Heading]][[Storage]][[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Storage Locked Vault.png|Locked Storage Vaults\nSealed Heavy Doors: 40 armor\nReinforced Barrier: 48 armor|Storage Recycling Entrance.png|Recycling exit\nSealed Blast Doors: 45 armor\nReinforced Barrier: 48 armor[[/Gallery]]\n\n[[Heading]][[Garrison]][[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Garrison Prisoners 1.png|Imprisoned Derelicts\nSealed Heavy Doors: 40 armor\nReinforced Barrier: 70 armor[[/Gallery]][[Spoiler]][[Heading]][[Scraptown]][[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Scraptown HQ Gate.png|Gate to Scraptown HQ\nUFD HQ Gate: 60 armor\nReinforced Barrier: 48 armor[[/Gallery]]\n[[/Spoiler]]\n\n[[Heading]][[Factory]][[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Factory Locked Extension Exit.png|[[Extension]] exit\nSealed Blast Doors: 45 armor\nReinforced Barrier: 56 armor|Factory DSF Exit.png|[[DSF]] exit\nReinforced Barrier: 56 armor[[/Gallery]]\n[[Spoiler]][[Heading]][[Zion]][[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Zion Deep Caves Exit.png|[[Zion Deep Caves]] exit\nSealed Blast Doors: 45 armor\nReinforced Barrier: 56 armor[[/Gallery]]\n\n[[Heading]][[Extension]][[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Extension Double Derelict Cell.png|[[Derelict]] cells\nSealed Heavy Doors: 40 armor\nReinforced Barrier: 56 armor|Extension Central Area.png|Extension central exit\nSealed Heavy Doors: 40 armor\nReinforced Barrier: 56 armor[[/Gallery]]\n\n[[Heading]][[Cetus]][[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Cetus Mainframe Doors.png|Cetus Mainframe Doors\nSealed Heavy Doors: 40 armor\nReinforced Barrier: 56 armor[[/Gallery]]\n\n[[Heading]][[Warlord (Location)]][[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Warlord Cache.png|Warlord cache\nSealed Heavy Doors: 40 armor\nReinforced Barrier: 56 armor[[/Gallery]][[/Spoiler]]\n[[Spoiler]][[Heading]][[Armory]][[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Armory Obliterator.png|Disassembled Obliterator Room\nSealed Blast Doors: 50 armor\nReinforced Barrier: 64 armor[[/Gallery]][[/Spoiler]]\n[[Redacted]][[Heading]][[Lab]][[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Lab Entrance.png|Lab entrance\nSealed Barrier: 80 armor\nReinforced Barrier: 64 armor|Lab LC Capacitor Room.png|[[LC Capacitor]] room\nBlast Barrier: 45 armor\nReinforced Barrier: 64 armor[[/Gallery]][[/Redacted]]\n\n[[Heading]][[Research]][[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Research Locked Quarantine Exit.png|[[Quarantine]] exit\nBlast Doors: 45 armor\nReinforced Barrier: 64 armor|Research DSF Exit.png|DSF Exit\nReinforced Barrier: 64 armor[[/Gallery]]\n[[Spoiler]][[Heading]][[Quarantine]][[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Quarantine Sigix Containment Room.png|[[Sigix Containment Pod]] room\nSealed Heavy Doors: 40 armor\nReinforced Barrier: 64 armor|Quarantine ST.png|[[Sigix Terminator]] room\nSealed Barrier: 80 armor\nReinforced Barrier: 64 armor[[/Gallery]]\n\n[[Heading]][[Testing]][[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Testing Regen Armor.png|SHELL Lab\nSealed Heavy Doors: 50 armor\nReinforced Barrier: 64 armor[[/Gallery]][[/Spoiler]]\n[[Redacted]][[Heading]][[Section 7]][[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Section 7 Unguarded Hangar Entrance.png|Unguarded hangar entrance\nSealed Heavy Doors: 50 armor\nReinforced Barrier: 80 armor|Section 7 Top of Hangar.png|Top of hangar doors\nSealed Heavy Doors: 50 armor\nReinforced Barrier: 80 armor|Section 7 LRC Cache.png|LRC Lab Cache\nSealed Heavy Doors: 50 armor\nReinforced Barrier: 80 armor[[/Gallery]]\n\n[[Heading]][[Protoforge]][[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Protoforge Reinforced Barriers.png|Lab walls\nReinforced Barrier: 80 armor|Protoforge Forge Walls.png|Forge Plexus area\nReinforced Barrier: 80 armor[[/Gallery]][[/Redacted]]\n\n[[Heading]][[Access]][[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Access Surface Exit.png|[[Surface]] exit\nSealed Barrier: 80 armor\nReinforced barrier: 70 armor\nSealed Heavy Doors: 35 armor|Access Command Entrance.png|[[Command]] exit\nSealed Barrier: 80 armor\nReinforced Barrier: 70 armor\nSealed Heavy Doors: 35 armor[[/Gallery]]\n[[Redacted]][[Heading]][[Command]][[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Command Right Side Surface Exit.png|Right side [[Surface]] exit\nReinforced Barrier: 100 armor|Command MC Door.png|Door to [[MAIN.C (Shell)]]\nSealed Barrier: 80 armor\nReinforced Barrier: 100 armor|Command MAIN.C Left Door.png|Left side door past MAIN.C\nHeavy Barrier: 100 armor\nReinforced Barrier: 100 armor|Command Cache.png|Left side cache\nSealed Heavy Doors: 80 armor\nReinforced Barrier: 100 armor|Command Left Side Surface Exit.png|Left side Surface exit\nReinforced Barrier: 100 armor[[/Gallery]][[/Redacted]]"

These reinforcements only stick around for about 150 turns before returning back to a nearby exit as opposed to staying permanently. Heavy reinforcement contents also depend on Cogmind's speed. If Cogmind is on a fast airborne propulsion type like hover or flight, Cutters will be dispatched far more frequently than Specialists. For all slower grounded propulsion types, Specialists are the most common summon type.\nHeavy reinforcements are called more frequently if Cogmind is actively moving. If trying to avoid reinforcements, Cogmind should quickly exit the Heavy's sensor radius rather than spend turns moving inside the radius. If the Heavy is on a [[Security Rotation]] and currently moving, it may be a good idea to stand still until the Heavy has moved away to try to avoid reinforcements rather than to continue moving in detection range.

The main exceptions are rating 9* prototypes, [[Alien Artifacts]], and a variety of other unique parts. Parts that cannot be repaired have a * next to their integrity in the stat view. Parts must first be inserted with the [[GameText]]Scan([Part Name])[[/GameText]] hack. Then, the rating-specific [[GameText]]Repair[[/GameText]] must be performed. Sometimes a part will become [[Broken Part|broken]] if this hack is failed. After the repair is initiated, the machine will take a rating-dependent number of turns to repair, regardless of the amount of missing integrity.\n[[Heading:4]]Time to Repair[[/Heading]]\nSecurity level 2 Repair Stations repair roughly twice as fast as level 1s do, and level 3 Repair Stations repair three times as fast as level 1s.\n[[Table]]\nRating|Level 1 Turns|Level 2 Turns|Level 3 Turns||\n1|26|13|8||\n2|32|16|10||\n2*|51|25|17||\n3|38|19|12||\n3*|60|30|20||\n4|44|22|14||\n4*|70|35|23||\n5|50|25|16||\n5*|80|40|26||\n6|56|28|18||\n6*|89|44|29||\n7|62|31|20||\n7*|99|44|33||\n8|68|34|22||\n8*|108|54|36||\n9|74|37|24\n[[/Table]]\n[[Heading:3]]Refit[[/Heading]]\nIf Cogmind has fewer than 2 filled slots in any of Power, Propulsion, Utility, and Weapons when performing this hack, he will be refitted with Backup Power, Propulsion, Plating, or Lasers respectively for each type of slots. While a maximum of 2 can be obtained at a time, more can be obtained through multiple refits by detaching the parts in between each hack.\n[[Table]]\nSlot|Security Level 1|Security Level 2|Security Level 3||\nPower|[[Backup Power I]]|[[Backup Power III]]|[[Backup Power VII]]||\nPropulsion|[[Backup Propulsion I]]|[[Backup Propulsion III]]|[[Backup Propulsion VII]]||\nUtility|[[Backup Plating I]]|[[Backup Plating III]]|[[Backup Plating VII]]||\nWeapon|[[Backup Laser I]]|[[Backup Laser III]]|[[Backup Laser VII]]\n[[/Table]]\n[[Spoiler]][[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Force(Patch)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]\nThis hack is best used to quickly repair things that have low current integrity but have a high maximum integrity. This can restore large amounts of integrity quickly for parts like [[Armor]] and [[Treads]]. [[Storage Unit|Storage Units]] are an especially good choice for this hack due to the unique ability of this hack to repair parts without needing to detach them and wait around. Otherwise, repairing storage units can be quite risky with [[Recycler|Recyclers]] stealing parts while waiting.[[/Spoiler]]"

In order for the alignment to take effect, Revision 17 must survive until Cogmind exits the map, all 8 [[Cetus Guard|Cetus Guards]] must be destroyed, and the Cetus Manufacturing Module machine must be intact.\n\n[[Heading]]-3 Research Invasion[[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]Research Revisions.png|Revision 17++ with Revision allies[[/Image]]\n[[Image]]Research Suppression Forces.png|Suppression forces dispatched to fight the Revisions[[/Image]]\n200 turns after entering the map, Revision 17++ will lead a group of 4 Revisions to follow Cogmind. They are uncontrollable allies but do not generate any alert for Cogmind when attacking. The announcement text [[GameText]]Unknown forces entering zones 8R, 1R, 4T. Local Systems Malfunctioning[[/GameText]] will precede their coming. Squads of 4 Revisions will continue to appear from main access exits every 200 turns. Occasionally a Revision will shout [[GameText]]Recycler![[/GameText]] and turn hostile, although this may also be followed by [[GameText]]##MEMORY:RESET##[[/GameText]] to turn them friendly again. 500 turns after Revision 17 arrives, an alert [[GameText]]Research terminal network lockdown[[/GameText]] will appear, and all Terminals on the map will shut down (other interactive machines are unaffected). Another alert will show up 50 turns later: [[GameText]]Suppression forces dispatched. All non-combat units evacuate.[[/GameText]] After this message, squads of 2 [[Executioner|Executioners]] or [[Striker|Strikers]] and an [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] will start to appear from exits and roam the map, looking for hostiles. They will also spawn every 200 turns.\nThere are a few other side-effects of this event. One is that explosive machines will explode at random whenever Cogmind is nearby. This can be good when fighting enemies around explosive machines, but be wary of them when walking around the map or else they may surprise you at a bad time. Another is that mapgen is affected. [[Heavy|Heavies]] will not appear on a map that Revision 17 invades.\n\nThis event can be a great blessing or a curse depending on a lot of factors. Getting an escort of alert-free allies with other squads of allies roaming the map is great. They will clean up most of the map for you and can net some free prototype bot loot. Blocking Heavy spawns is incredibly useful here as well. The downsides can also be pretty major, however. Losing access to all Terminals by turn 700 can be very bad if Cogmind is on slow propulsion and has no exit intel and no form of terrain scanning. Trying to follow the spawning Revisions or suppression forces can lead to an exit, although it can be a bit unreliable. Another downside is that the Revisions will often create a ton of squads to appear right at the beginning of the event. Sometimes, large groups of [[Operator|Operators]] and alarm traps can all be triggered at nearly the same time. This can result in massive groups of hostiles to appear right in Cogmind's face with unlucky exit or [[Garrison Access|Garrison]] positioning.\n\nDue to a bug (fixed for Beta 15), going through a Garrison and looping back to -3/Research will cause the event to partially continue.[[Comment]]Apparently it was a bug?[[/Comment]]\n\nLast edited during Beta 14.",

Humpback]]: Curator's Association Exhibit[[/List]]\n\n[[Heading]]Requirements[[/Heading]]\nIn order to effectively full clear Scraptown, there are a few general requirements:\n[[Heading:2]][[Triborg]] Solve[[/Heading]]\nTriborg is by far the scariest individual bot on the map with an incredibly powerful [[Siege Cannon]] that can quickly kill an unprepared Cogmind. Siege mode brings Triborg's initially high 40% core exposure down to a significantly reduced 28% which makes direct damage dealing a rather inefficient method. An EM resistance of 65% doesn't help an EM approach much either, with an average requirement of 285 EM damage to be dealt before corruption death. Very little conventional weaponry can deal enough damage to eliminate Triborg in a reasonable amount of time.\nThe most reliable way to beat Triborg is with meltdown. Large groups of allies with heat transfer can easily overheat Triborg before it gets much chance to deal damage. [[Storage]] frequently has a vault of 10 [[Grunt|Grunts]] that will become friendly to Cogmind upon entry. These 10 Grunts are sufficient to melt Triborg within a few volleys, if not instantly. [[Army Drone|Army Drones]] from [[Army-in-a-Box]] can also produce sufficient heat transfer for an easy kill. [[DAS Turret|DAS Turrets]] from [[Deploy-a-Sentry]] do not have heat transfer but have extremely high damage output, so if Cogmind can hold Triborg's fire, 3 or 4 turrets taken from the Exiles can deal enough conventional damage for core destruction.\nAside from allies, there are few other Exiles Prototypes that can handle the Triborg fight:\n[[List]]\n[[AWS/Autocannon]]: The Autocannon has an incredibly high damage output that can take Triborg out within 4 core hits.|\n[[Field Lobotomy Kit]]: Triborg is not Disruption immune so the FLK will instantly turn a threat into a useful ally|\n[[Firepult]]: Firepult has sufficient heat transfer to melt Triborg with ease. Make sure to pack plenty of cooling to use this early.|\n[[YOLO Cannon]]: YOLO Cannon's high 50% meltdown critical easily kills Triborg. Note: the AOE effect of YOLO cannon may damage the loot on the ground.[[/List]]\n[[Heading:2]]Trash Killer[[/Heading]]\nCogmind should have an efficient way of dealing with the dozens of average to weak-strength bots that will swarm Scraptown after hostilities begin. All bots will rush straight to the center of the map and Cogmind needs to either hide or take them out very efficiently. Simply average-depth loot will be unable to take out the huge rush of bots. The main strategies are to have an overwhelming force in the center of the map or to stand further away down a corridor and try to take bots out in smaller groups. If opting for the second strategy, long-ranged weaponry is the best to take advantage of some of the shorter-ranged bots.\nHere are some good tools for the job:\n[[List]]\nGood [[Launcher|Launchers]]: Since these bots tend to roam the map in groups, having powerful decently-ranged launchers like the [[Hvy. Rocket Launcher]] is the best way to take out groups from afar.|\nAWS/Autocannon: Autocannon has enough damage to core any bot on this level, builtin targeting, fires beyond Cogmind's vision, and even has no upkeep cost.|\n[[AWS/Gauss]]: Notably worse than the Autocannon with significantly lower damage, but still good for similar traits. With 3 weapon slots, can be combined with another non-AWS weapon for additional damage.|\nSiege Cannon: Easily lootable off of Triborg with a [[CPS Tube]]. This requires the use of [[Tri-treads]] also dropped from Triborg to enter siege mode and avoid the recoil chance. Siege Cannon is not a great weapon to stay in the center of the map with, but retreating down the corridors where it is most effective can be difficult too.|\n[[Hvy. Assault Cannon]]: High range and sufficient damage to one shot any bot on core.|\nDAS Turrets have high visual range (22) and will kill every bot in one core hit. Keep in mind that eventually they will run low on matter and take longer to fire.|\nBot Army: While they don't last forever, a well positioned army can act as a firing squad for bots that wander into their line of sight. Ideally this includes some combination of Storage Grunts, miscellaneous [[Recycling]] rewirable bots, and potentially even fabricated [[0b10]] bots like [[P-60 Hacker|P-60 Hackers]].|\nArmy-in-a-Box: Similar to a Grunt army, only there's a lot more Army Drones available. Don't use too many at once or else they will get in each others' way. For maximum effectiveness, return bots that have taken core hits and bots that have short-ranged weapons.\n[[/List]]\n[[Heading:2]]Essential Parts[[/Heading]]\nNo NPC murder setup is complete without a few highly essential build components:\n[[List]]Backup Treads: Cogmind can easily salvage Triborg for Tri-treads and those should be used if possible. However, depending on Cogmind's starting position, it may be possible to be stuck fighting without having time to move over to the Triborg loot and swapping to the treads. If Cogmind happens to miss a CPS tube hit, a lot of essential loot may not drop.|\nBackup Wheels (Optional): [[Wheels]] are useful to temporarily swap on to move quickly. Useful for picking up matter out of Tractor Beam range.|\nBackup Armor: Self-explanatory. Triborg drops [[Mak. Medium Armor Plating]] and Elites drop [[Mak. Light Armor Plating]] to use in a pinch.|\nBackup Weapons: Aside from Siege Cannon, most of the weapons dropped by NPCs on this map are not ideal for Cogmind to use in Scraptown.|\nBackup Power: Self-explanatory.|\n[[Cooling Devices]] (optional): Siege Cannon in particular is hot to use in prolonged combat.|\n[[Ranged Targeting Utilities]]/[[Weapon Cyclers]]/[[Core Analyzers]] (optional): Useful offensive utilities|\n[[Hardlight Generators]]/[[Shield Generators]]/[[Force Fields]] (optional): Useful defensive utilities|\n[[Tractor Beam|Normal]] or [[Hpw. Tractor Beam]] and [[Matter Compressors]] (optional): Siege cannon requires a lot of matter to use. Matter storage and Tractor Beams allow Cogmind to continue to fight in extended encounters without having to reposition to collect more matter.|\n[[Adv. Visual Processing Unit]]/[[Seismic Detector]] (optional): With long ranged weapons like Siege Cannon, it is best to hit enemies before they can see you and outside of their visual range.\n[[/List]]\n\n[[Heading]]When to Kill[[/Heading]]\nGenerally, a build should be designed for killing Scraptown several maps ahead of time. This will typically involve going to [[Exiles (Location)]] and either taking [[FarCom]] or killing/stealing for powerful Exiles prototypes that can handle Scraptown kills. Scraptown kills are best done on -7 for the maximum amount of slots and preparation time. While it may still be possible to kill earlier, killing at -7 is difficult enough already. Cogmind should have at least 3 propulsion slots and 3 weapon slots to use Tri-treads and Siege Cannon from Triborg.\n\n[[Heading]]Location to Fight[[/Heading]]\nWhen engaging hostilities, there are 2 best points where Cogmind can choose to start the fight:\n[[Heading:2]]Next to the UFD Gate[[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]Scraptown Triborg Surrounded.png|Grunts surrounding Triborg prepared to melt it down, with nearby Protector[[/Image]]\nThe gate is the best place to begin if Cogmind has allies or a quick way to neutralize Triborg. There is lots of room so allies won't have to run past each other or try to shoot through each other like they would in hallways. However, the open area is also a downside for the hostile UFD bots that can pour in from many different directions. Allies should initially be positioned around Triborg in a box as shown to the right. If a [[Protector]] is available, place it close to the corner of the Gate so it is more out of harms way. Note: Even with a large number of allies, expect to have to retreat to the corner of the map at some point during the fight.\n[[Heading:2]]Bottom Left Corner[[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]Scraptown Bottom Left Triborg Path.png|Path Triborg should take if in the bottom left corner[[/Image]]\nIf the Triborg solution doesn't involve allies, it is much better to hide in the corner of the map to avoid the initial bot swarm. Stay in the position shown in the image to the right to begin hostilities. When Triborg peeks around the corner, move up a few tiles so Triborg is forced to move closer to Cogmind to shoot. The right side path to this location is a little short, but the top path can take good advantage of the large sightlines.\n\n[[Heading]]Beginning Hostilities[[/Heading]]\nIf Cogmind starts the Scraptown assault near Triborg, the #1 priority is to use a CPS tube on Triborg to ensure full salvage drops. Take out Triborg with whatever means are available, then grab and equip the Tri-treads and Siege Cannon (if slots available). The center is a tough position to stay long-term, so use allies as temporary distractions and retreat to a safer area of the map like the bottom left corner. If fighting in the corner, start by either shooting a wall out or killing any nearby bot. Lure Triborg close and use the CPS Tube, then go for the kill or assimilate. After Triborg is dead, stay put and slowly clear out the UFD squads that wander by. Eventually, Optimus and friends will come directly to Cogmind. After taking them out, the hardest challenges of the map are done.\nAt this point, patience is key. Wait around for any leftover UFD patrols to wander by and take them out. Leaving too soon can force a fight against a lot of bots in a bad position. Generally, only moving around to collect more matter when needed is the best strategy here. A [[Seismic Detector]] can tell when patrols are coming by from far away.\nAfter waiting around for a few thousand turns without any action, it is time to take the center of the map. This is where the vast majority of the remaining bots are. Sniping bots from afar one at a time works best here as heading directly into the center area can alert larger groups of bots to all attack simultaneously. There are likely still a few dozen bots hanging around the area. After the center is all cleared, be careful of any patrols leftover on the right side of the map.\n\n[[Heading]]Loot Time[[/Heading]]\nMost of the loot should be fairly self explanatory to grab. A few less obvious ones:\n[[List]]\nDig through the back of the Scrapoid Pod storage to get many more pods|\nDig out the center earth tile in LU-1G1's Boring Crew room|\nCheck rooms closed for remodelling for the rare Exp. Plasma Cutter|\nSmash open the wall hiding additional Botcubes in the Botcube Research room\n[[/List]]",

   "Content": "When first entering [[Cetus]], the 4 [[Cetus Guard|Cetus Guards]] appearing around the corner may appear intimidating at first. However, they are not too tough of foes and have some extremely useful loot, especially the [[Adv. KE Penetrator]], [[Centrium Heavy Treads]], and [[Centrium Medium Armor Plating]]. They have an above average amount of core integrity but no critical destroy immunity or EM resistance, so destroy critical weapons like [[Hyp. Weapons]] and [[Electromagnetic Weapons]] work quite well against them. [[Electromagnetic Launchers]] like the [[Proton Missile Launcher|regular]] and [[Imp. Proton Missile Launcher]] are particularly effective at taking out 4 of them in a short amount of time. There will be some [[Corrupted Parts|corrupted]] parts, but this loot is definitely worth the corruption. \nOften, Cogmind will have a big group of allies brought over from [[Extension]]. These can be helpful and harmful at the same time. Too many allies, especially melee ones, will get in the way of each other. Telling some blue-controllable allies to stay back can be a good idea. [[A7]] in particular is a great ally, providing EM damage and [[Remote Force Field|remote force fielding]] effects. Another standout ally is the [[Guerrilla (5)|Guerilla]]. They have -Salvage from their [[Bore Cannon]], but perform very well against the Cetus Guards due to their very high critical destroy chance, often destroying weapons or even cores in a single hit. However, to get optimal salvage, they should be left behind.\n\n[[Heading]]Cetus Mainframe[[/Heading]]\nThe [[Reinforced Walls#cetus|Cetus Mainframe Doors]] have a very low base success rate of 10% and a high armor value of 40. While [[Hackware]] can help out here, the Cetus Guards can conveniently drop a [[Adv. Variable Charge Gun]] which can be overloaded to destroy the Sealed Heavy Doors. A [[Plasma Cutters|Plasma Cutter]] will eventually cut through as well.",

   "Name": "Strategy/Defeating Architect",
   "Content": "[[Image]]Access_0 Entrance.png|Hostile Entrance to Access_0[[/Image]]\n[[Access_0]] is one of the hardest maps in the game that requires Cogmind to deal with numerous powerful threats on the map that gives very little breathing room for fixing a build that is starting to fall apart. Assuming [[MAIN.C]] is defeated in [[Command]], there is a large amount of preparation that can be done after all of the bots have become disabled. [[Command#command_cache_contents|MAIN.C's cache]] can provide some incredibly powerful parts, and the rest of the map can have plenty of goodies to grab. Since Access_0 is a very combat-oriented map, make sure to bring backups of essentials like power, propulsion, weapons, and armor. While there are some part caches in Access_0 itself, their contents are not particularly reliable and shouldn't be counted on to provide crucial backups. A more consistent source of parts are the drops from the [[Enhanced Bot|Enhanced Bots]] and the [[A Bots]], assuming weapons with neutral salvage can be used at least some of the time. There tend to be abundant legs and mediocre-quality power above all else from the [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]] and [[Enhanced Hunter|Enhanced Hunters]]. The Grunt's [[Neutron Cannon|Neutron Cannons]] can serve in a pinch, but aren't impressive due to their middling damage and short range.\n\n[[Heading]]Propulsion Selection[[/Heading]]\nAll propulsion types can be used to win in Access_0, although some are definitely better suited to the map than others. Hover and legs are nice middle ground propulsion that can have a lot of power and still retain maneuverability. Treads are the best heavy combat type with lots of coverage and integrity, but they may get stuck fighting in bad situations with no good way to reposition. Wheels are much more more niche than treads due to the rarity of good lategame wheels. Flight is the easiest to use to take down all of the pads but can struggle the most to finish off the Architect in the final fight due to lack of integrity.\n[[Heading:2]][[Flight Units|Flight]][[/Heading]]\nFlight builds should be extremely quick at this point in the game (sub 20 speed) and are able to outrun every bot on the map. Flight does not have the integrity for prolonged fighting. Typically flight builds should destroy the pads first and then try to lure the Architect away from all of the other bots for a quick kill. Evasion utilities in [[Phase Shifters]] and [[Reaction Control Systems]] work well to minimize the number of attacks that land. More expensive defensive utilities like [[Shield Generators]] or [[Force Fields]] also combine well with evasion utilities but may be tough to support. A bots are a major threat to this playstyle, as their remote force fields can prolong the final encounter to the point that Cogmind is unable to finish off the Architect. Destroy critical weapons like the [[Hyp. Multirail]] can be good for taking out a few enhanced bots or removing hover units off of key A bots so they don't catch up as quickly for the final fight. A strong final Architect-killer weapon is a must for this strategy.\n[[Heading:2]][[Hover Units|Hover]][[/Heading]]\nHover builds tend to be the hardest to put together but can end up with a strong mix of speed, offensive, and defensive capabilities. Using a [[Zio. Metafield Generator]] or [[ST Field Compressor]] can help to outrun groups of bots or reposition more easily. However, a strategy entirely based on running away tends to fare much worse for hover builds due to the lower speed and ability to get trapped with the inability to hop in tight 1 tile corridors. Hover builds should choose their fights carefully and can reposition in combat to avoid getting outnumbered. Unlike Flight builds, Hover builds usually have the energy and mass support to use both evasion utilities and other defensive utilities like Force Fields. This combination can cut down significantly on attrition while exploring the map.\n[[Heading:2]][[Legs]][[/Heading]]\nLeg builds finally start to trend into the area where having a reliable way to \"shoo\" (deal 80 core damage to trigger the teleport) the Architect is a requirement. Legs can take advantage of the movement bonuses to dodge (5/10/15 extra evasion per tile moved in a row) and use evasion utilities to avoid most shots while running in a straight line. However, extensive repositioning is quite expensive, even for faster leg builds. [[Infowar]] like [[Terrain Scanners]] or [[Drone Bays]] can help locate the pads quicker and reduce damage taken from the Architect coming back repeatedly. One option for legs is a \"siege legs\" build, where an extra pair of treads are used in addition to the standard legs. This requires 2 extra propulsion slots above what Cogmind already needs to support for the full effect. However, it is not worth attaching treads if it will place Cogmind overweight. One of the bigger benefits of this strategy is that the Enhanced Hunters can't continually knock Cogmind back into collapsed tiles due to the knockback cancellation ability of treads. Additionally, siege mode can be used for tough encounters.\n[[Heading:2]][[Wheels]]/[[Treads]][[/Heading]]\nWheels and treads are the slowest Access_0 propulsion types, and as such, need to be the most prepared for heavy combat. Lots of armor and strong weaponry are required for these builds. Wheel builds tend to have lower propulsion slots and higher utility slots, necessitating more utility slots being taken up by armor to compensate. Treads usually have 6-8 propulsion slots and can afford to run less armor in utility slots due to the higher propulsion coverage. Terrain scanning and drones are especially recommended for these builds to reduce the pad finding time. They will end up needing to shoo the Architect repeatedly throughout the level and fight every bot they meet.\n[[Heading:2]][[Sigix Exoskeleton]][[/Heading]]\nThe Exoskeleton plays a little differently from the other propulsion types. Due to its incredible amount of builtin infowar, it is quite easy to find and destroy all of the Architect's pads. With the [[Sigix Shearcannon]] it is quite easy to destroy every bot on the map in a few volleys. An Exoskeleton-boosted [[Core Cannon]] can kill the Architect from full integrity, which allows skipping the pad destroying altogether. With weaker weapons like [[Sigix Sheargun|Sigix Shearguns]] or a [[Sigix Broadsword]], the Exoskeleton tends to play like a hover build without much shooing power, taking a few specific encounters and killing A bots, but mostly running from the Architect in favor of searching and destroying the pads.\n\n[[Heading]]Key Weapon Roles[[/Heading]]\nSome weapon types excel at some situations and not in others. Entropic, Kinetic, Pierce, Slashing, Thermal, Vortex damage-dealing weapons all tend to be good all-around in Access_0. Electromagnetic damage is decent in a few key places, while Impact and Explosive damage tend to be subpar. However, there are some particularly useful weapons for specific circumstances. Ratings below include (-) = not suitable for role, (~) = passable for role, (+) = good for role, (++) = great for role. Ratings are a combination of how good the weapon is at killing something, its + or - salvage potential, and resource costs of use.\n[[Table]]\nWeapon name|A bots|Architect shoo|Architect final fight|Enhanced Grunts|Enhanced Hunters|Enhanced Programmers|Enhanced Sentries||\n[[Blast Cannon]], 2 preferred with siege mode|(+)|(~)|(+)|(+)|(+)|(-)|(~)||\n[[Cld.

Mostly niche use for flight/hover.|A6 is neutral to EM and annoying to kill otherwise, but all other A bots are 75% resistant.|Vortex Lances are the strongest melee weapon here but they have limited uses and should be used sparingly. A bots and the Architect final fight are the best uses for the Vortex Lance as a primary weapon.|Multirails are reasonable Architect shooers, but they have a very high matter upkeep. A [[Desublimator]] or other matter regenerating utilities are recommended to allow Multirails to shoo over a long period of time.|The Cep. Plasma Driver is a slightly worse Architect shoo due to its 1/3 chance of dealing less than the 80 damage required.|The Sigix Shearcannon has incredible firepower but it comes with a caveat. Cogmind must typically be within 2-4 tiles of the target in order to gain maximum damage potential. Otherwise the weapon's arc will cause some projectiles to miss, with higher percentages of projectiles missing at further distances. This weapon is best suited for faster propulsion types, although even treads can make good use if it in some situations.|Vortex weaponry is quite powerful and good at killing all in Access_0. However, it is not good to use for fighting everything as they have limited usages. A bots and the final Architect kill tend to be the most important uses.|These launchers have very strong killing power and Architect shooing potential. However, the incredibly high matter cost makes them not a good choice for regular usage. One or two [[Prc. Matter Filter|Prc. Matter Filters]] along with a Desublimator may make this a more reliable option, but it may be a bad idea to rely too heavily on launchers without other good options due to the risk of running out of matter entirely.|The Alpha Cannon Mk. II does not need any particle charging in some situations but does in others. It naturally kills 120 integrity Enhanced Grunts/Hunters in 2 hits with its base 65 damage. A bots and Enhanced Sentries have 150 core integrity which takes 3 hits. However, an Adv. Particle Charger ups the damage to 81. This turns those 3 hits into a 2 hit kill. This also matters for the Architect, where 81 damage will guarantee the shoo on a single core hit instead of requiring 2 hits.[[/List]]\n\n[[Heading]]Other useful parts[[/Heading]]\n[[Heading:2]]Targeting[[/Heading]]\nSpecifically, [[Ranged Targeting Utilities]], for ranged combat, or [[Melee Analysis Suites]] for melee. Targeting is the most important combat utility to use in Access_0. The Architect and Enhanced Hunters all run [[Exp. Phase Shifter|Exp. Phase Shifters]] which dramatically reduce chance to hit ranged attacks. Running 2-3 targeting utilities is extremely recommended to maintain a high chance to hit, although melee builds are able to get away with fewer.\n[[Heading:2]]Core chance to hit boosters[[/Heading]]\nSpecifically, [[Core Analyzers]] and [[Armor Integrity Analyzers]]. Next to targeting, these are the best offensive utilities to use. Core Analyzers are superior, but they both work together. An Armor Integrity Analyzer should be used over the second Core Analyzer if there is space.\n[[Heading:2]][[Weapon Cyclers]]/[[Actuators]][[/Heading]]\nWeapon cycling is another great way to increase the damage done. Keep in mind they do require extra weapon energy/heat upkeep as the full volley will be fired more quickly than without. A [[Mni. Quantum Capacitor|Mni.]] or [[Quantum Capacitor|Regular Quantum Capacitor]] is good for any single powerful energy cannon, especially ones that can shoo the Architect in a single core hit.\n[[Heading:2]][[Kinecellerators]]/[[Particle Chargers]][[/Heading]]\nNearly mandatory for some weapon types and less important for others. In some cases, like with the Omega Cannon and an Adv. Kinecellerator, it can be the difference between a single core hit Architect shoo and a double core hit Architect shoo.\n[[Heading:2]][[Shield Generators]] and [[Force Fields]][[/Heading]]\nForce fields are one of the best ways to reduce damage in the game as long as their heavy energy demands can be met. Airborne propulsion may want to use Shield Generators for their lesser energy requirements and lighter mass.\n[[Heading:2]][[Phase Shifters]]/[[Reaction Control Systems]][[/Heading]]\nAll around good ways to reduce damage taken. Reaction Control Systems can only effectively be used by airborne propulsion types and legs.\n[[Heading:2]][[Microwarp Drive]][[/Heading]]\nThis is especially useful for grounded propulsion types. The Microwarp Drive can be used to travel large distances very quickly in order to get to a specific pad location, reposition for a fight, or even just move around much quicker than normal. The core cost is prohibitive for constant warping, but this item can save a lot on overall build attrition with good use.\n[[Heading:2]]Scouting Infowar[[/Heading]]\nSpecifically, [[Terrain Scanners]] with [[Terrain Scan Processors]], [[Drone Bays]], [[Visual Processing Units]], [[Structural Scanner]] or [[Deep Structural Scanner|DSS]] variant, [[Triangulator]], or [[IFF Parsers]]. All of these provide extra bot or map intel which can be used for locating pads more easily, finding shortcut digs that can be taken, or avoiding some bots. The Structural Scanner is more useful for airborne propulsion than grounded propulsion since it works instantly and can be used to dodge groups of hostiles if running away. It doesn't typically help find the pads sooner like the others.\n[[Heading:2]][[ECM Suites]][[/Heading]]\nFor airborne propulsion only. This can help take some pressure off by causing groups of followers to much more quickly lose tracking of Cogmind.\n[[Heading:2]][[Triangulator]][[/Heading]]\nThis typically niche item has a unique ability in that it allows for tracking hostiles at 24 range even if they can't be seen via other sensor methods. The Architect has scan cloak 5 which prevents all other detection methods. Using the Triangulator can pinpoint the way the Architect is coming from at long range which can greatly help in determining pad locations.\n[[Heading:2]]Matter generating utilities[[/Heading]]\nSpecifically, [[Desublimator]], [[Field Recycling Units]], [[Matter Filters]], [[Tractor Beams]], and [[Matter Compressors]]. For any kinetic based weapons or weapons that cause a lot of negative salvage like the Potential Cannons, having ways of stockpiling matter or restocking up on matter mid-map can be entirely essential to avoid losing the run due to running out of matter. The Desublimator can be found off of Enhanced Hunters only on this map, but the others can be brought over from earlier maps.\n[[Heading:2]]Energy support[[/Heading]]\nSpecifically, [[Energy Wells]], [[Power Amplifiers]], and [[Energy Filters]]. All of these utilities can be used to maintain expensive energy cannons and force fields through prolonged combat. Energy wells can be dropped on the ground to instantly absorb the energy needed to keep firing, while the others must be attached to help.\n[[Heading:2]][[Remote Datajacks]][[/Heading]]\nIf the Data Conduit is used, Cogmind will be given intel for instant kill codes for all A bots that must be used with a Remote Datajack.\n[[Heading:2]][[Terrabomb]][[/Heading]]\nAlthough a little niche, Terrabombs do great at opening up a large part of the map to check for nearby pads. This is a double-edged sword since any nearby groups of enemies will spot you instantly, and the Architect can potentially start shooting from out of weapon range.\n[[Heading:2]][[Sigix Terminator|Regular]] or [[Supercharged Sigix Terminator]][[/Heading]]\nThis single-use weapon is best used after taking down all of the pads in order to kill or at least severely cripple the Architect for the final fight. If airborne, this can also be used to kill off a lot of the bots following behind in a big mass.\n[[Heading:2]][[Transdimensional Reconstructor|Regular]] or [[Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor]][[/Heading]]\nThere is almost always one of these on the map somewhere, and the Architect drops one when defeated. However, using one of these to escape can be an issue if defeating the Architect with a weapon with knockback like a kinetic cannon because it may be dropped too far away to pick up to exit the map in time. Potential Cannons also have a habit of destroying them when dropped on the ground. Keeping a spare is a way to escape with a non-Architect killing win if all hope is lost instead of dying in Access_0.\n[[Heading:2]][[Core Reset Matrix]][[/Heading]]\nThere are several Alien Artifacts on the map and using the Core Reset Matrix ahead of time allows for locating them right away on entering the map. Sometimes being able to head for a Core Regenerator or Integrity Redistributor right away after entering the map is the difference between a loss and a win.\n[[Heading:2]][[Integrity Redistributor]][[/Heading]]\nUseful to prevent essential parts of the build from breaking or just generally to repair everything at once. Limited parts with very high value such as [[Shieldings]] or non-regenerative armor like [[Zio. Shade Armor]] or [[Exp. Powered Armor]], as well as unique parts that are essential to the build, should be taken off preemptively at low integrity in order to use a Redistributor on them at a later time.\n[[Heading:2]][[Core Regenerator]][[/Heading]]\nMost helpful if using core-hungry Alien Artifacts like the Core Cannon, Microwarp Drive, or an Integrity Redistributor. It provides 400 (or more core with [[LRC Armor]] that can be used as more fuel for these parts, or even just extra integrity to stay alive. Sometimes it is better to use before entering the map if core is low enough.\n[[Heading:2]][[Navigation Efficiency Matrix]][[/Heading]]\nWhile this artifact can be very painful to use from the random teleportation, it does have some good usages in Access_0. When teleporting, all of the Enhanced bots lose tracking on Cogmind. This can be used on airborne propulsion to avoid getting large groups of Enhanced bots following behind, or on grounded propulsion to attempt to reposition or even avoid fighting groups of enemies. It is a mixed bag since it can just as easily teleport Cogmind into an even worse position than before.\n\n[[Heading]]Stages of the map[[/Heading]]\nThere are several distinct stages of the map where different strategies can be used. Some playstyles may skip certain stages entirely, like how a flight build will typically not stick around for the initial map fight, while grounded propulsion builds will have to fight.\n[[Heading:2]]Initial fight[[/Heading]]\nCogmind is confronted by the Architect, A8, and 2 dormant Enhanced Grunts. Rarely, a patrol of more Enhanced Grunts or Enhanced Hunters spawns close enough to also join in here. Flight will typically ignore this part and skip straight to hunting for the pads to destroy. Hover can kill all the bots and shoo the Architect right away or move deeper into the level and try to fight the bots one-on-one instead. Grounded propulsion usually need to fight right at the starting position, so be prepared with strong weaponry to begin with. Siege up right at the entrance of the map if using treads. Targeting the Architect for a shoo is usually the best approach, followed by A8, and finally the Enhanced Grunts. If lacking any good Architect shooing weapons, focusing A8 first may be preferable so A8's Remote Force Field won't be able to protect the Architect.\n[[Heading:2]]Searching for the pads[[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]Access_0 Subspace Access Node.png|Subspace Access Node layout[[/Image]]\nThis stage is where the vast majority of the time spent in Access_0. This part involves running or actively fighting the Architect, Enhanced bot guards and patrols, and the A bots as they appear. Infowar utilities are most useful at this time. The general strategy for combat here is to shoo the Architect and then start heading in the direction that it came from. Since it typically comes from the closest pad, that is the best way to get in the right general area. However, if multiple pads are close by, the Architect can start spawning at different pads and coming at different directions. This can make it tough to decide which direction to head in. Infowar is best to help find the pads in this situation, but if none is available then making a guess at the pad location and heading there is better than getting stuck moving back and forth in a loop, failing to get anywhere.\nWhen using terrain scanning, there are often telltale signs of a pad even before getting the whole area scanned. Any of the 4 inner tiles or the 4 surrounding cyan tiles are very recognizable. The white tiles surrounding the machine are also not guaranteed to lead to a pad, but they are good to investigate. Finally, pads are always found at the end of 2 tile corridors. Following 2 tile paths can be a good way to get to the final pad location.\nDrone Bays and especially Terrain Scanners tend to have high coverage and not the most impressive integrity. They should usually be swapped out during any prolonged combat encounters for offensive utilities or better armor. With a good shooing weapon, it may not be necessary to swap out every time the Architect comes. Make sure these important utilities don't get destroyed early on. If using drones, the best time to release them is just before or right after the Architect teleports away. That gives them the maximum amount of time to explore before the Architect gets a chance to attack them.\nIf the [[Data Conduit]] was used, finding the pads is easy since all the machines are revealed on entering the map. However, the additional [[Enhanced Programmer]] patrols can be a huge pain even when knowing exactly where to go. Make sure to have a good answer to these Programmers.\nMost of the A bots are fairly similar in overall strategy to fight. Most have remote force fields that shield allies, so the A bots are a high priority to take out first. EM is ineffective against all of them except for A6, for which EM is the best solution. Generally, any other damage type is fine for taking out the rest of them. Core Stripper and Disintegrator are uniquely good for killing some of the A bots because they guarantee (or nearly guarantee) full salvage of all parts.\n[[Heading:2]]Destroying the Singularity Gate (optional)[[/Heading]]\nDestroying the gate is an optional action that needs to be done in order to obtain any Architect Logs lore without a way to dig into the 120 armored shell. Otherwise, the singularity will crush Cogmind before there is enough time to get the lore. The gate is on the left side of the map and [[A2]] is on the way. The gate itself is very fragile and just about any weapon will destroy it easily. It is best to get rid of nearby pads on the right side of the map before crossing the bridge so the Architect takes longer to get to Cogmind's location. After that, take the trek back to finish off the final pad and the Architect.\n[[Heading:2]]The final pad[[/Heading]]\nAfter all the other pads are destroyed, the Architect will continually teleport back to the last pad. This can be frustrating for grounded propulsion, where after being shooed the Architect will return after only a few moves as you get closer and closer. At a certain point, it is best to ignore the Architect and just walk by until the last pad is destroyed. Faster propulsion types have an easier time of doing this, and the Microwarp Drive can help a lot here. Putting on evasion utilities helps to reduce the damage taken during this last walk.\n[[Heading:2]]The final fight[[/Heading]]\nAfter all this, the Architect can finally be fought normally. For grounded builds, siege up with any treads if you have them, then start fighting to the death. Frailer airborne builds might need to lure the bulk of the pursuers to one corner of the map and then take the Architect to the other side of the map to avoid getting overwhelmed.\n[[Heading:2]]Escape/cleaning up[[/Heading]]\nAfter the Architect is destroyed, the Singularity Gate will be trigger a 10 turn countdown if still intact. Grounded builds may need to be close to the Architect if relying on the Transdimensional Reconstructor that it drops. The singularity countdown will kill Cogmind instantly if still on the map in that time. Slower builds will usually need to detach all parts and core hover to equip the Reconstructor and to make it to the exit. Airborne propulsion usually have enough time to get to the exit without needing to do this.\nIf the gate is destroyed, however, there is an unlimited amount of time to clean up any stragglers on the map. Get the [[Architect Data Core]] and head to the bottom-left corner of the map to open up the Architect Logs Terminal and obtain any new lore. Exploring the rest of the map will cause all remaining A bots to spawn as normal. The A bots and any other remaining Enhanced bots can be fought for extra points.",

   "Name": "Strategy/Defeating MAIN.C",
   "Content": "[[Command]] is one of the toughest maps in the game and has a lot to prepare for. Since the most challenging encounters on the map are fixed, it is possible to prepare for many things ahead of time. Unlike the basic [[Wintype]], combat is mandatory in order to kill [[MAIN.C]], although Cogmind does not necessarily need to do any fighting. However, it is always a good idea to be able to meaningfully contribute to the fight. [[Command#cave_seal_contents|Cave Seal allies]] can be incredibly strong, and can even kill MAIN.C unaided in some cases.\n\n[[Heading]]Seal Strategy[[/Heading]]\nBoth [[Warlord (Alignment)]] and [[Imprint]] seals are quite powerful and have the potential to carry a run through the [[Command#doom_corridor|Doom Corridor]], and sometimes even through MAIN.C. Since seals have a 0% base success rate, opening them requires some forward planning. A decent stack of [[Hackware]] is all but required to open seals successfully. Killing 0b10 [[Operator|Operators]] can be a good way to stockpile Hackware ahead of time. Destroying one or more Network Hubs in [[Hub_04(d)]] can provide free defensive hacking bonuses. Prototype Hackware is very useful here for minimizing the number of utilities that need to be carried around. Other ways to increase hacking capabilities are the [[Terminal]] Trojan(Botnet) hack and the allied Operator bonus.\nOne advantage of Warlord alignment is the ability to skip the Hackware requirement entirely. After staying approximately 1000 turns in the [[Warlord (Alignment)#-2_research_assault|-2 Research Assault]], a special manual hack will be given to Cogmind that will open both Command seals.\nLocating the Seals can be difficult on some maps. Unless the Phase Generator is destroyed, terrain scanning does not work in Command. It may be worth keeping a [[Terrain Scanners|Terrain Scanner]] around in case of an early Phase Generator. While it does generate 150+ Alert, the ability to search for Seals and potentially use [[Sensor Arrays|Sensors]] to avoid enemy encounters may be a worthy tradeoff. Unfortunately, the [[Machine Analyzer]] does not work on seal Terminals, and neither does the [[GameText]]Index(Terminals)[[/GameText]] hack. Using the [[Data Conduit]] trivializes the search, as all machine intel is given instantly upon entering the map.\nOnce a seal has been located, there is one choice to make. Use the seal now or fight the Doom Corridor first and come back for the seal for the MAIN.C fight? The answer can depend on the seal type, Alert situation, machine location relative to the Doom Corridor, Cogmind's build, and more. Opening a seal will spawn a large group of allies immediately and allows a few backup waves to spawn over time. This is great to protect Cogmind immediately, although it may not help the Alert situation in the case of Imprint or Core Reset Matrix (CRM) seals if there are a lot of hostiles nearby or if the seal is far away from the Doom Corridor. Large groups of blue or purple allies can skyrocket Alert and trigger [[High Security]] quickly. Warlord allies do not generate Alert themselves, so this is less of an issue for that faction. If the seal is far from the Doom Corridor, it may be impractical for Cogmind to defeat the Doom Corridor solo and then make the trek back to the seal and then all the way back to MAIN.C without getting caught up by additional patrols, [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]], and [[Assault Squad|Assaults]]. Prolonged time in Command will cause part attrition to Cogmind and/or a loss of seal allies very quickly. High Security disables the seal machines and the Assault forces will make quick work of any amassed allies with additional [[Demolisher|Demolishers]] being sent along, although already opened seals will not stop spawning allies when the machine network is disabled. If Cogmind is already in good shape to take on the Doom Corridor without assistance, the allies may be better saved for the MAIN.C fight instead.\n\n[[Heading]]Doom Corridor Strategy[[/Heading]]\nThe Doom Corridor is the first major fight of the extended endgame. 2 [[M Guard|M Guards]] and 2 [[Combat Programmer|Combat Programmers]] down a hallway. They can tank very well and deal quite a bit of damage back to Cogmind. It is possible to skip fighting Doom Corridor to avoid any combat at this part, but it is not generally recommended because all 4 of the guards will be summoned to aid MAIN.C later on. The vast majority of runs hoping to complete Command will have to fight head-on.\n[[Heading:2]]Doom Corridor Skip[[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]Command Doco Skip.png|One Doom Corridor skip[[/Image]]\nDigging past the Doom Corridor requires a strong digging tool that can break through 100 armor tiles, ideally at range. Dig the path shown on the right to safely get past without being spotted. The end of this path results in a 4 tile dig which does have a slight cave-in risk. There is an alternative route that digs directly into the terminal tile and through the Sealed Barrier instead, but this can be even riskier as a poorly timed misfire or misdirect can place Cogmind in a very bad spot. Another alternative skipping solution for airborne builds is to use one or mores [[ECM Suites]] after luring the guards out of the corridor. The idea is to loop the Combat Programmers across the map for a while until the M Guards get sufficiently far out of the way. Then use the ECM Suites on the return trip so they forget about Cogmind. Then simply pass through the corridor up to MAIN.C, forgotten by its guards.\n[[Heading:3]]Why skip?[[/Heading]]\nThere are a few reasons why skipping the guards might be desirable. If going for a [[Command#w8_fortifying_0b10surrender|W8 Wintype]], keeping the Doom Corridor guards alive is very useful for defeating the summoned [[Enhanced Q-Series]]. The more bots destroyed on the way, the fewer guards there are to protect Cogmind and MAIN.C for the hard part of the ending. Another reason could be if [[Zhirov]]'s SGEMP quest has been completed. Zhirov will set off the Modified SGEMP after phase one of MAIN.C is defeated any unpower all bots anyway, so there is not a big benefit in fighting the Doom Corridor first, except for the possibility of looting the valuable M Guard loot. One last reason might be if Cogmind has a very powerful MAIN.C killer, where the guards won't be able to reach Cogmind by the time MAIN.C is dead. This is mostly applicable to the extreme superweapon the [[BFG-9k Vortex Edition]] that can kill MAIN.C in only a few hits.\n[[Heading:2]]Doom Corridor Guards[[/Heading]]\nThe Doom Corridor guards are quite intimidating at first glance. The Combat Programmers don't deal too much damage compared to the M Guards, but they still rack up [[Corruption]] quite quickly, and their strong hacking ability can assimilate allies. M Guards can deal massive direct damage to Cogmind and any allies around with their powerful launchers.\nThe guards complement each other well and protect the other bot type effectively. M Guards are reasonably susceptible to EM attacks with only 50% damage resistance, but Combat Programmers can cleanse their corruption before getting enough for a kill. The M Guards provide high damage reduction to the Combat Programmers with their [[AEGIS Remote Shield]] that makes them more difficult to kill first.\n[[Heading:2]]Useful parts vs Doom Corridor[[/Heading]]\nSome specific parts can be especially helpful for conquering the Doom Corridor:\n[[Heading:3]][[Point Defense Systems]][[/Heading]]\nMost of the damage coming from the M Guards is from their Launchers. A single [[Adv. Point Defense System]] has a roughly 2/3 chance of shooting down a Launcher shot coming in from >3 range. A second one brings that chance up to about a 90% chance to shoot down Launcher shots. This is a significant damage decrease to Cogmind if fighting solo and is absolutely crucial to keeping large groups of allies alive.\n[[Heading:3]][[Exp. EM Shield]][[/Heading]]\nFairly self-explanatory, this part will reduce the offensive threat of Combat Programmers substantially.\n[[Heading:3]][[Imp. Shock Absorption System|Imp]]/[[Exp. Shock Absorption System]][[/Heading]]\nThis is a good alternative to the Adv. Point Defense to cut down Launcher damage taken.\n[[Heading:3]][[Graphene Brace]][[/Heading]]\nThis part is most helpful against [[Graviton Cannon]] M Guards. Blast is a scary mechanic to face, and getting an Adv. Point Defense blasted off immediately into a Launcher hit is the stuff of nightmares. It also helps a little against the Combat Programmer corruption criticals.\n[[Heading:3]]Strong Thermal Cannons like [[Enh. Nova Cannon]][[/Heading]]Combat Programmers have a -25% resistance to Thermal damage and strong Cannons are the best way to exploit this. Alternatively, a thermal gun stack with good burn criticals can be used to overheat the bots to death and earn an early kill.\n[[Heading:3]]Strong EM Cannons like [[Com. HERF Cannon]][[/Heading]]\nAfter the Combat Programmers are taken down, the M Guards are vulnerable to EM damage. With high resistances all around and an additional 50% damage reduction from AEGIS, EM is the ideal way to kill here. M Guards only have 50% EM resistance, and EM corruption ignores the AEGIS damage reduction entirely. HERF can take down an M Guard in relatively few volleys.\n[[Heading:3]][[Core Stripper]]/[[Disintegrator]]/[[Warp Cannon]][[/Heading]]\nThese weapons can instantly kill any of the Doom Corridor guards. Core Stripper and Disintegrator in particular are great at generating loot, although they have prohibitive resources costs. These are best used by airborne builds that can easily separate the guards from each other for easier looting. Alternatively, allies can be used to draw fire away from Cogmind so that the dropped loot doesn't get beat up by M Guard Launchers.\n[[Heading:3]][[Firepult]][[/Heading]]\nThis part can single handedly melt all of the Doom Corridor bots in only a few volleys, with some lucky hits. If heat dissipation allows, using a Quantum Capacitor can help a lot to overwhelm the [[Exp. Coolant Injector|Exp. Coolant Injectors]] of the M Guards even quicker.\n[[Heading:3]][[Vortex Catalyst Activator]][[/Heading]]\nThis launcher is uniquely good at softening up the Doom Corridor due to dealing Vortex damage, something that none of the bots resist. It may not be able to single handedly kill all the guards due to the limited number of shots it can fire, but it should get most of the way there, albeit with the cost of dropping loot to 0.\n[[Heading:3]][[Microwarp Drive]][[/Heading]]\nThis part is very strong for slow treaded bots. Either get into line of sight or shoot with a long-ranged weapon to attract attention, then warp out of the corridor to safety. This allows for easily separating the Combat Programmers to destroy them first without any AEGIS protection. The M Guards will take a long time to make their way over.\n[[Heading:3]]Defensive [[Hackware]][[/Heading]]\nDefensive Hackware will reduce the chances of Combat Programmers being able to hack allies. Very useful if Cogmind has seal allies.\n[[Heading:3]][[Energy Wells]][[/Heading]]\nUsing stored energy to continue firing EM weaponry or to power expensive [[Defensive Utilities]] is always useful in combat.\n[[Heading:3]]Traps[[/Heading]]\n[[Fire Trap|Fire Traps]] and EM traps like [[EM Surge Trap|EM Surge Traps]] can be used to take out the Combat Programmers and M Guards respectively.\n[[Heading:3]][[Relay Coupler [Proto]|Prototype Relay Couplers]][[/Heading]]\nA [[RIF]] build can assimilate the M Guards with these, although the Combat Programmers are immune.\n[[Heading:3]][[Field Lobotomy Kit]][[/Heading]]\nThe Field Lobotomy Kit can assimilate both Combat Programmers with the cost of 2 charges. They typically make short work of the M Guards afterwards.\n[[Heading:2]]Doom Corridor Combat Strategies[[/Heading]]\nThere are several common Doom Corridor fighting strategies that depend on obtained parts and allies:\n[[Image]]Command Doom Corridor MWD.png|Using a Microwarp Drive to lure the Combat Programmers away[[/Image]]\n[[Heading:3]]Solo Cogmind[[/Heading]]\nIf Cogmind is fighting alone, it can be very effective to lure the Combat Programmers out first to kill them before the M Guards arrive. A Microwarp Drive makes this very easy to do. Without a Microwarp Drive, one strategy is to use a long ranged [[Ballistic Cannons|Ballistic Cannon]] to shoot one of the M Guards and then duck into one of the Warlord cubbyholes. The Combat Programmers will run out of AEGIS protection range to fight. With good offensive firepower, the Programmers will be destroyed by the time the M Guards catch up. If not, it is still good to finish them off before moving to the M Guards. Switch over to EM to quickly finish the M Guards. Even a weaker EM weapon like a [[Gamma Rifle]] from a [[P-80 Master]] is more effective at killing M Guards than most other damage types.\n[[Image]]Command Doco Warlord Aggro.png|Path to allow Warlord to draw aggro, good with Core Stripper and Disintegrator[[/Image]]\n[[Heading:3]]Seal Charge[[/Heading]]\nIf one or more seals have been activated, there can be a large mass of allies following Cogmind around. If grounded and slow, sometimes there are so many allies that no kind of special maneuvering is possible. In this case, charging down the Corridor is the only real choice. If possible, try to use an Adv. Point Defense or two to keep allies alive as long as possible. This strategy usually results in most or all allies getting destroyed in the fight. If Warlord is present, he will typically be the last ally standing for this type of strategy. In fact, Warlord alone can end up carrying the entire Doom Corridor fight. He has 100% EM resistance so the Combat Programmers can't hurt at all, and he has a massive amount of integrity to tank the M Guards.\nOne variant of this strategy is to try to sneak around the top of the Corridor with the intention of Warlord or other allies getting spotted first. This will result in the majority of allies getting Launchered out of existence very quickly, but will keep fire off of Cogmind. The tradeoff here is that it is much easier to sneak in with a Core Stripper or Disintegrator and preserve dropped M Guard loot while Cogmind is not the primary focus of the guards. Otherwise, Cogmind rushing in can result in -salvaged M Guards or existing floor loot being destroyed.\n[[Image]]Command Doom Corridor Lure Setup.png|CRM Imprint seal Doom Corridor lure setup[[/Image]]\n[[Heading:3]]Lure strategy[[/Heading]]\nThis strategy works best with fast airborne builds and/or with blue CRM-controlled Imprint seals. The general idea is to set up a killzone just outside of the Doom Corridor front doors and lure the guards to that spot. For Imprint, try to separate Experimentals in a way such that multiple Experimentals won't get hit by a single M Guard Launcher hit. If Warlord seals, try to lure the Derelicts back a little ways to give yourself some breathing room before you return. Run or Microwarp in, get the guards to follow you out, then let your allies do their thing. Ideally the M Guards don't make it out until Combat Programmers are dead, and they should suffer the same fate as the Programmers. This works better with a large number of allies, particularly Experimentals or Z-Heavies, and a wide-open area outside of the Doom Corridor. This usually results in much fewer ally casualties due to bots rushing in front of each other and getting in each others' way, blocking LOS and causing missed shots to result in friendly fire. It can be a good idea to hide behind a wall for a bit after luring the guards since they will prioritize Cogmind first and take a while to switch into attacking other hostiles.\n[[Heading:3]]Trap strategy[[/Heading]]\nThis strategy works best with fast airborne builds or tread builds with the Microwarp Drive. Use Fire Traps first to take out the Combat Programmers. 1-2 should result in a heavily disabled or entirely melted down Programmer. A thermal weapon can be used to trigger the full meltdown of a bot in critical range to begin with. After the Programmers are dead, place down any type of EM-damaging or corruption trap. EM Surge Traps work best. 2-3 of these will take down an M Guard alone. Use of a [[Trap Extractors|Trap Extractor]] is helpful to preserve inventory space.\n[[Heading:3]]Assimilation strategy[[/Heading]]\nUsing RIF with Prototype Relay Couplers is an easy way to handle some bots in the Doom Corridor. However, Combat Programmers are immune to all RIF effects, which makes this strategy a little awkward. After taking out the Combat Programmers by whatever means are available, 26 charges of these couplers will assimilate the 2 M Guards.\n[[Heading:2]]Accessing MAIN.C[[/Heading]]\nMAIN.C is locked behind a very powerful [[Reinforced Walls#command|sealed barrier with 80 armor]]. The Terminal has a high base success rate of 60% but may not always be available. If Cogmind has hit High Security or if the Terminal is blown up while fighting the Doom Corridor, alternative methods must be used to gain entry.\nPowerful Thermal weaponry including [[Cld. Nova Cannon]], [[Null Cannon]], [[Potential Cannon]], [[Imp. Potential Cannon]], and [[Core Cannon]] can be used to dig through the center. An high rating reactor explosion from an [[Electromagnetic Launcher]], such as the [[Shock Bomb Launcher]] sometimes available on [[Warlord D3-CKR]], can destroy a few wall tiles at a time. [[Plasma Cutters]] can be used to disassemble the Sealed Barrier as well. Another alternative is to skip through the barrier with a [[Spacefold Activator]], or to dig around it using a [[Matter Drive]], [[LU-1G1's Laser Shovel]], or [[Terrabomb]].\n\n[[Heading]]MAIN.C Strategy[[/Heading]]\nAfter bypassing the Doom Corridor in one way or another, the big boss MAIN.C lies ahead. The [[MAIN.C (Shell)|first form]] is the easier of the two. It is easier to hit, has weaker weapons, lacks some resistances that the second phase has, and has no strict timer. However, the disruption effects on the [[Hpw. Disruptor Cannon|Hpw. Disruptor Cannons]] can be quite annoying, especially for builds that are very close to the support limit or builds with few weapons. Consider [[Dynamic Insulation Systems]] or [[Shieldings]] to protect crucial parts from Disruption.\nHowever, the [[MAIN.C|second phase]] is much scarier. This form deals much more damage, has a 20% blast from the [[Omega Cannon]], gains Thermal and Explosive resistance, becomes much quicker at 34 speed. Most importantly, this form puts Cogmind on a time limit since the Command Garrisons become active. Linger too long and hoards of 0b10 bots will come into the room.\n[[Heading:2]]Useful parts vs MAIN.C[[/Heading]]\n[[Heading:3]]Strong Kinetic, Entropic, or Vortex weapons[[/Heading]]\nPhase two is 75% resistant to Thermal damage and Explosive damage, and 100% EM resistant. That only leaves melee weapons and the aforementioned ranged damage types capable of realistically taking him down. While superweapons or allies can help take him down easily, 4 [[Linear Accelerator|Linear Accelerators]] backed with offensive utilities is enough to win. Some other good weapon choices are: [[Hcl. Linear Accelerator]], [[Multirail]], [[Graviton Cannon]], [[Omega Cannon]], [[Zio. Phaser-H]], [[Zio. Alpha Cannon]], [[Zio. Alpha Cannon Mk. II]], [[Vortex Cannon]], [[Vortex Driver]], [[Vortex Rifle]], [[Vortex Shotgun]], [[Sigix Sheargun]], and [[Sigix Shearcannon]].\n[[Heading:3]][[BFG-9k Vortex Edition]][[/Heading]]\nThis unique weapon deserves a special mention of its own. This will always kill with 2 core hits and even guarantees the kill in one with a single [[Adv. Particle Charger]].\n[[Heading:3]][[L-Cannon]][[/Heading]]This weapon is also very unique. The completed L-Cannon is capable of killing MAIN.C in a single hit, and with good aim, can even destroy both phases in a single volley. Due to MAIN.C's fixed location and the L-Cannon's unique infinite range, it is possible to camp out in the corner of the map and destroy phase one safely out of sight. If MAIN.C survives into phase two, Cogmind can just wait around until he comes into range to finish the job.\n[[Heading:3]][[Graphene Brace]] (MAIN.C)[[/Heading]]\nPhase 2's 20% blast from the Omega Cannon can blast parts off of Cogmind, causing wasted time re-equipping parts or destruction of critical utilities. Graphene brace completely negates this risk.\n[[Heading:3]][[Imp. Utility Shielding|Imp.]] or [[Exp. Utility Shielding]][[/Heading]]\nThese will protect vital utilities and also protect utility parts from getting blasted by phase two.\n[[Heading:3]]A strong Launcher[[/Heading]]\nwhile MAIN.C himself is highly resistant to Launchers, the Garrison ARCs can wander into the room and drop a bunch of bots on top of Cogmind. It can be worth swapping to a Launcher to finish off that group before switching back to MAIN.C.\n[[Heading:3]]Chance to hit core utilities[[/Heading]]\nSpecifically, [[Core Analyzers]] and [[Armor Integrity Analyzers]]. Since killing MAIN.C quickly is the highest priority, these utilities are greatly appreciated to cut down time to kill. Killing quicker also has a stacking effect. The less time MAIN.C is alive, the less time he has to regenerate core, and the fewer overall core damage is required.\n[[Heading:3]]Kinetic resistance[[/Heading]]\nFor example, [[Focal Shields]] or kinetic [[Resistance Armor]] like the [[Hvy. Reactive Plating]]. Being able to cut down on the kinetic damage dealt by phase two can help a lot. Hvy. Reactive Plating in particular can be acquired on the map from [[Warlord 4Z-XS3]]\n[[Heading:3]]Any Remote [[Datajacks|Datajack]][[/Heading]]\nThe A7 MAIN.C hack can only be delivered with a manual hack performed with a Datajack.\n[[Heading:3]][[Energy Wells]][[/Heading]]\nPowering Force Fields or expensive Energy Cannons can require a lot of energy, and storing some in advance is always helpful. Consider pre-dropping energy wells so that energy is available when needed.\n[[Heading:3]][[Matter Compressors]] or [[Tractor Beams]][[/Heading]]\nKinetic weapons, especially [[Ballistic Cannons]], can eat through stored matter very quickly. Without a good way to replenish it mid-combat, Cogmind can run out of matter entirely. Phase one will typically drop a large amount of matter that can be gathered mid-combat with a Tractor Beam. Matter Compressors do a good job of storing matter ahead of time. [[Exp. Matter Compressor|Exp. Matter Compressors]] can be looted from M Guards earlier. In a pinch, [[K-01 Serf|K-01 Serfs]] can carry [[Med. Matter Pod|Med. Matter Pods]]\n[[Heading:2]]MAIN.C Combat Strategies[[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]Command Warlord Seal MC Attack.png|Charging MAIN.C with Warlord Cave seal allies[[/Image]]\nThere are not too many strategies for killing MAIN.C. The majority of the work is going to be in the initial setup and not necessarily in the actual fight. The typical course of action is to step into the room, use the MAIN.C hack (if obtained this run), take a few steps into the room, and [[Siege Mode|siege]] up if wearing Treads. After that just start shooting. Phase one can be destroyed with thermal weapons to preserve matter for Kinetics or integrity for Vortex weaponry. When phase one is almost destroyed, it can be worth pre-switching to the phase two build to ensure minimum delay between phase two summoning the Garrisons and MAIN.C dying.\n[[Heading:2]]Post-kill[[/Heading]]\nAfter the kill, a large portion of the 0b10 forces will begin to turn on each other. However, it is not safe yet as both 0b10 factions will still try to fight Cogmind. Grab whatever loot there is from MAIN.C (make sure to grab the [[MAIN.C Data Core]]) and decide what to do next. If Warlord is still alive, getting within line of sight of him will result in a W7 \"Establishing Free Derelict Territories\" win. Otherwise, there are two main options here:\n[[Heading:3]]Hide in the MAIN.C room[[/Heading]]\nDigging through the machinery to hide in the corners of the room can avoid getting spotted by the remaining 0b10 forces. This is most effective with a weapon that can dig into the 100 armor Reinforced Barriers around the room. Otherwise, the machinery tends to get destroyed over time and Cogmind will eventually become exposed. Digging and hiding in the walls is a little safer, just be sure not to get caved in on. Either way, just wait out the 600 turns until all of the remaining bots are disabled.\n[[Heading:3]]Heading to the left side of Command[[/Heading]]\nThere are some 0b10 bots wandering around the left side, but much fewer than the ones on the right side. Usually, a little fighting is required to head this way. Hiding out in one of the corners on the left side here is much safer than trying to hide in the corners of the MAIN.C room without being able to properly dig. There is a much smaller chance of wandering bots discovering your hiding spot. The Command cache is a great safe spot to hide in.\nIf surrounded by a lot of hostiles, one potential strategy is to drop all parts except for the propulsion and try to return later. Core hovering with propulsion armor can be an effective way to escape to left side of Command.\nAfter the bots are disabled, there are two more options to take. Either take one of the surface exits now, or break the Wave Inhibitor machine, loot the map, and teleport to Access_0. If going to Access_0, there is plenty of good loot on the ground or still on unpowered bots. Some of the nicer targets for looting are [[Executioner|Executioners]], [[Alpha 7|Alpha 7s]], [[B-99 Colossus|Colossi]], and both forms of MAIN.C. The Command cache also has plenty of strong prototype parts that will help out.",

   "Name": "Strategy/Defeating Superfortress",
   "Content": "[[Image]]Protoforge Superfortress.png|Dormant Superfortress in Protoforge[[/Image]]\n[[Superfortress]] in [[Protoforge]] is arguably the strongest robot in the game with powerful offenses that easily out-damage other endgame bosses and a defensive profile including resistances to most common damage types, an efficient [[Exp. Force Field]], near immunity to launchers with the [[Cep. Antimissile System]], and regenerating core integrity and parts. Killing Superfortress is a feat that can only be accomplished by incredible offensive firepower, either through Cogmind's own power or by overwhelming numbers. Even after getting the kill, the punishment includes much more dangerous future floors and an immediate triggering of [[High Security]] unless the UFD assault has begun. Builds should be in peak condition to even consider attempting the kill.\n\n[[Heading]]Overwhelming Firepower[[/Heading]]\nThere are a few main ways that Cogmind can single-handedly output enough damage to take out Superfortress in a reasonable amount of time. These approaches typically require rare weapons, a difficult to sustain amount of heat dissipation and matter stockpile, and a generally fantastic build.\n[[Heading:2]]Triple [[Linked Autogun|Linked Autoguns]][[/Heading]]\nLinked Autoguns can be obtained in bulk by killing [[Tracker|Trackers]] after using the [[Data Conduit]]. The [[Cep. Thermoelectric Network]] is ideal to reduce the amount of cooling utilities required to sustain fire, but stacking multiple [[Adv. Coolant Injector|Adv]] or [[Exp. Coolant Injector|Exp. Coolant Injectors]] can work too. 3 of these puts the firing delay at 25 which is the lowest possible value.\n[[Heading:2]]Ovr. Weapon Stack[[/Heading]]\nOvr. weapons, especially the top tier [[Ovr. Railgun]], [[Ovr. Quantum Rifle]], [[Ovr. Linear Accelerator]], and [[Ovr. Nova Cannon]], can be easily obtained in bulk from the [[UFD]] bots during the [[Protoforge#w9_defending_0bprimeufd_assault|UFD assault]]. 8 of these will hit the delay cap of 25 delay per volley. Cep. Thermoelectric Network is a required item for this strategy because of the completely unreasonable amount of heat per turn that gets generated (easily over 1000 per turn).\n[[Heading:2]][[Scrap Engine]][[/Heading]]The Scrap Engine can be quite unpredictable but very powerful. Larger weapon constructs, especially 4 slot ones, can deal absurd amounts of damage in the mid hundreds range. It is possible to build up a powerful construct before entering the map, although there are a lot of strong parts in Protoforge to help become even more overpowered. Finishing the construct with entropic or vortex damage is the best option due to the lack of resistances, but kinetic damage works reasonably well against Superfortress.\n[[Heading:2]]Melee Sneak Attacks[[/Heading]]\nWhile Fortress is [[Protoforge#dormancy|dormant]], it is possible to get free sneak attacks until the 10 turn wake up process is completed. For a powerful weapon with low delay combined with Femtoactuators, this can be a free 10 sneak attacks with no damage returned and no bots summoned. This is best for fast flight builds with a fully fabricated melee kit. Even though 10 turns is often not enough to kill, if Superfortress is brought down to only a few hundred core integrity, it is reasonable to finish the rest of the kill even under fire. While some nice melee parts are available in the lab, the more time spent back there is a higher risk that Cogmind will eventually be reported and lose the sneak attack opportunities. The best weapons for this approach are [[Vortex Lance|Vortex Lances]], [[Exp. Jetlance|Exp. Jetlances]], and the [[Superquantum Companion]].\nIt is still possible for a peak flight melee build to take out Superfortress while awake. However, doing so is much riskier and will cost a ton of integrity even if successful. Worst case, the build may not be intact enough to escape the map with the imminent High Security.\n[[Heading:2]][[BFG-9k Vortex Edition]][[/Heading]]\nThe BFG deals a huge amount of entropic damage which is one of the few damage types that isn't resisted by Superfortress. The weapon damages itself with use and it has a tendency to tank lots of damage from high coverage, so protecting it with defensive utilities is a must. [[Exp. Weapon Shielding]] can be looted from [[Hotshot|Hotshots]] and is a great choice to keep it alive long enough to secure the kill.\n[[Heading:2]][[Vortex Shotgun|Vortex Shotguns]][[/Heading]]\nThe Vortex Shotgun is another powerful source of Entropic damage. It is much less flashy than the BFG, but easier to support with lower vulnerability and resource costs. Two of these (keeping only one attached at a time) coupled with a [[Quantum Capacitor]] and [[Exp. Target Analyzer]] can deal good damage to Superfortress. With the Target Analyzer, each of the 3 projectiles has a 15% chance to explode an engine, hurting Superfortress as well as any nearby bots that were summoned. While Superfortress has no engines, it can't fire back on Cogmind due to the high energy upkeep of its utilities which can massively cut down on the amount of damage taken during the fight.\n[[Heading:2]]Protoforge Kinetics Build[[/Heading]]\nIt is possible for a more \"standard\" build to defeat Superfortress without any unique parts or gimmicks, although it will be extremely difficult compared to all other methods. Trying to fight Superfortress \"fairly\" tends to be a recipe for disaster, but with enough Protoforge parts, it is possible to win single-handedly. The best possible build includes multiple [[Cep. Helical Railcannon|Cep. Helical]] or [[Cep. Heavy Railcannon|Cep. Heavy Railcannons]], at least 4 or more slots worth, with an Exp. Kinecellerator, combined with other standard offensive and defensive combat utilities like [[Core Analyzers]], [[Weapon Cyclers]], and [[Armor Integrity Analyzers]]. Be aware that this will be an uphill battle throughout.\n\n[[Heading]]Overwhelming Numbers[[/Heading]]\nThere are also strategies that involve use of allies to overwhelm Superfortress instead of only relying on Cogmind's own damage output. Most standard allies are not suitable for this purpose for a few reasons. First and foremost, Superfortress can assemble a variety of launcher if Cogmind has many allies. Most army strategies quickly fall to the top tier launchers that he can assemble, especially the unique [[Gamma Driveblaster]]. A Cep. Antimissile System can mostly negate this downside. The other major downside is the increased assembling rate of Superfortress bots when allies are around. Without adequate firepower, it may quickly turn out that Superfortress's army outnumbers Cogmind's own. Ideal allies are independently strong/tanky, extremely numerous, or bots with Impale criticals to help to lock Superfortress down so that it can't take actions.\n[[Heading:2]][[Immortal|Immortals]][[/Heading]]\nImmortals have a fast attack rate, high Impale crit rate, and can be assimilated in the map with [[RIF]] by using [[Relay Coupler [Proto]|Proto Relay Couplers]], so they make great choices for allies. 4 Immortals can keep Superfortress from attacking most of the time, and the 5th will typically allow Superfortress to be permanently stunned via impale criticals. Be aware that Superfortress can still assemble bots in this state, so it is not a totally safe kill, especially if the assembled bots start to kill off Immortal allies. Focus on keeping the assembled allies off of the Immortals and they will finish Superfortress off.\n[[Heading:2]]Liberated [[K-01 Serf|K-01 Serfs]] (Yes Really)[[/Heading]]\nSerfs that are assimilated by [[IN-MT5's Pitchfork \"Insurrection\"]] will become armed with a [[Shield Trident]], a ranged 100% Impale weapon. While the damage on these weapons are not particularly high, they can permanently lock Superfortress down just like Immortals. 4 or more is recommended to maintain the lockdown. Try to keep as much fire off of the Serfs as possible, as even with the Shield Trident they are still fairly fragile.\n[[Heading:2]]UFD Army[[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]Protoforge Teleported Superfortress.png|Superfortress teleported into the UFD army[[/Image]]\nThe UFD assault from the event contains numerous strong bots, especially [[Triborg (Optimus)]] and [[Scraphulk|Scraphulks]], and are perfect for eliminating Superfortress. The hardest part is getting them to meet in a favorable position. There are 2 main strategies to use the army against Superfortress:\n[[Heading:3]]Superfortress Lure[[/Heading]]\nThis strategy involves luring Superfortress out of its initial spawn position down to the place where the army pops out in the forge area. Either pop in and out of sight or hit with a long-ranged weapon to continue to retain aggro on Superfortress. This strategy is best performed on a fast airborne build to stay out of weapons range most of the time. After Superfortress is near position, initiate the event at a Recycling Unit.\n[[Heading:3]][[Supercharged TR]][[/Heading]]\nBy using a [[Dimensional Node Initializer]] with a Supercharged TR, Superfortress can be brought to the center of the forge where the assault is happening. Plant the Node close to the incursion point at the bottom right of the map, engage the event, and then rush over to Superfortress. If Cogmind is fast enough, the teleport will leave Superfortress surrounded by the initial assault of UFD bots. This strategy is most effective with high UFD readiness.\n[[Heading:2]]Fabricated Army[[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]Protoforge Fabricated Army.png|Reasonably sized fabricated army of Hunters and Duelists (10 Authchips)[[/Image]]\nFabricating a bot army is a relatively difficult strategy to pull off. For optimal results, Superfortress must stay dormant for the entire process so that all fabricated bots can be adjusted into position before starting the fight. If the bot army has to approach an awake Superfortress, there is little chance of success since bots will only slowly trickle into range. For this reason, a Jamming Amplifier is highly recommended to avoid any jamming failures.\nThere are 4 level 3 [[Fabricator|Fabricators]] in the forge section of the map that can allow for very rapid fabrication with a lot of [[Authchip [R/Combat]]]. The [[H-88 Terminator]] is arguably the best bot to fabricate for the Superfortress kill due to its high core integrity, damage output, and evasion. A few [[L-61 Swordsman|L-61 Swordsmen]] are also a good addition thanks to their high damage output that isn't resisted, although only a limited amount of melee bots can fit around Superfortress, so there is a practical limit to them.\n\n[[Heading]]Other Useful Items[[/Heading]]\n[[Heading:2]][[Cep. Rapid Grenade Launcher]][[/Heading]]\nWhile not capable of taking down Superfortress single-handedly, this part deserves a special mention. Most kill strategies will take long enough for Superfortress to assemble an army of bots that will wear Cogmind down. The Cep. Antimissile System prevents easy launchering of the growing army. However, the Cep. Rapid Grenade Launcher's unique effect bypasses this part, making it one of the few ways to quickly take out a group of Superfortress-assembled bots at once.\n\n[[Heading:2]][[PL-3XN's Obliterator]][[/Heading]]\nThe Obliterator is another weapon that is worth mentioning independently. While it has high damage, its limited number of shots and very high matter cost makes it unsuitable for a full kill. Still, its ability to rip components off of any target makes it very valuable for nearly all kill strategies. The only parts that the Obliterator will fail to rip off are the [[Exp. Heavy Siege Treads]], [[Centrium Heavy Armor Plating]], and any 2-slot weapons that happen to be assembled. It rips off all power and all defensive utilities each time it is fired, dramatically reducing Superfortress's offensive and defensive capabilities. Its secondary instant-kill effect can also clear up any assembled hostile bots nearby.\n\n[[Heading]]Escaping the Map[[/Heading]]\nAfter Superfortress is dead, there is still the remaining issue of leaving the map in one piece. Unless the UFD assault has begun, High Security will begin to activate as Superfortress dies. The ideal strategy in this case is a Dimensional Node Initializer placed near the exit. Airborne builds can usually make it to the exit before the first wave of assaults spawn due to their high speed. For grounded builds without these options, be prepared to fight through multiple waves of High Security while heading to the exit. [[Sterilization]] not being an option on this map means that there is no possibility to siege up and fight until the end.",

   "Name": "Strategy/Extension",
   "Content": "[[Image]]Extension Guide Route.png|Recommended path through Extension[[/Image]]\n[[Extension]] is a straightforward map with little variation between runs. The typical strategy is a fairly simple one:\n[[List:Ordered]]\nFrom the spawn location, take the path to the top-left of the map. Travel along the right and destroy any hostiles. Rewiring and freeing bots in cells is an option at this point, but it is usually better to wait to do this to keep [[Alert]] lower and to preserve ally integrity for the center fight.|\nOnce reaching the middle of the map vertically, head back to the beginning area rather than continuing down. The 1 tile corridor tends to get too congested and favors the [[0b10]] defenders there. Free or rewire any remaining allies along the way, then take the army and charge into the center of the map from below. Here, the open corridor allows for better lines of fire for the army.|\nAssuming the fight went reasonably well at this point, the remainder of the map should be a breeze to run through. Free and rewire any allies on the top right of the map and then head down to the exit.\n[[/List]]\n\n[[Heading]]Extension Dig[[/Heading]]\nOne alternative to fighting through the center of the map is to dig across through the top. This is typically a 10 tile dig, which has a reasonable risk of cave-ins occurring. If there were few allies gained or they were destroyed, or if Cogmind's offensive ability is very low, this alternative route may be preferable. Beware [[cave-ins]] this way.",

   "Name": "Strategy/Hub_04(d)",
   "Content": "Blowing up Network Hubs in [[Hub_04(d)]] can be very valuable to the run thanks to the huge defensive hacking bonuses provided. However, destroying one as soon as you see one by shooting immediately is usually a bad idea. Shooting them directly causes a ton of [[Alert]] around the order of several hundred due to their large destructive radius. The [[Lightning]] squads that follow can also be very scary for an unprepared Cogmind. It is often a better idea to blow up the Hubs from a distance, especially when right next to exit.\n\n[[Heading]]Explosion Methods[[/Heading]]\nThere are a lot of methods to blow up Network Hubs that do not trigger the alert gain:\n[[Heading:2]]Hostile attack[[/Heading]]\nIf a bot stands in front of a Network Hub and an [[0b10]]-aligned bot misses into it, the destruction will be associated with that bot and not Cogmind. This works especially well with allies and drones. Position the ally in front of a Hub and attacking enemies can shoot around or through them to trigger the explosion. The Lightning [[EMDS]] has a 100% penetration, so any allies standing in front of a Hub is sure to get it to explode.\n[[Heading:2]][[Traps|Trap]] explosion[[/Heading]]\nTraps never assign Alert to Cogmind unless manually triggering the trap. Any explosive or area EM traps will work, [[I]]but[[/I]] if the trap triggers due to Cogmind's [[Corruption]] then the alert isn't assigned, which can be used to avoid the alert. For example, plant a [[Dirty Bomb]] trap and then walk back and forth over it. Eventually, this will trigger the trap to explode.\n[[Heading:2]][[Plasma Cutter|Regular]] or [[Imp. Plasma Cutter]][[/Heading]]\nPlasma Cutters can destroy explosive machines like Hubs without triggering the explosion. This can be nice for for Cogmind to avoid being caught out in the open in a bad defensive position. Because the majority of the Alert gained from destroying a Hub is from the explosion, this will reduce the typical several hundred Alert gain down to just 15.\n[[Heading:2]]Force(Sabotage)[[/Heading]]\nIf successful, this hack will blow up a random explosive machine on the map. Network Hubs are the only available targets in this map, so this will always hit a Hub if successful. However, this hack is inconsistent and may fail multiple times in a row. It does cause an Alert gain of 50 if successful, but it is substantially less than the several hundred of a manually-blown Network Hub. Note: unlike this hack, Trojan(Detonate) does cause Alert to go up from the Explosion and is not a great hack to use.\n\n[[Heading]]Lightning[[/Heading]]\n4 squads of these will appear after blowing up any Hubs. They can be defeated with combat or evaded.\n[[Heading:2]]Combat[[/Heading]]\nThe best way to deal with the Lightning squads is to use critical destroy weapons as they lack any critical immunity. [[8R-AWN's Boregun]], [[Adv. KE Penetrator]], or [[Hyp. Weapons]] work well. [[Damper Plating]] works great at reducing damage taken by Lightnings to negligible amounts. The [[Exp. EM Shield]] that they carry is a lot less effective than Damper Plating, but is still a substantial reduction and only costs 1 slot.\n[[Heading:2]]Evasion[[/Heading]]\nLightning have Scan Cloak 5 which makes them entirely undetectable by [[Sensor Arrays]]. However, there are still some methods that can be used to track them:\n[[List]]\nSensor Arrays can still track the [[I-47|Archangel]] that follows the squads around|\n[[Seismic Detector]]|\n[[FarCom]]|\n[[IFF Parser]]\n[[GameText]]Trojan(Track)[[/GameText]] at [[Terminal|Terminals]]\n[[/List]]",

   "Name": "Strategy/Looting Protoforge",
   "Content": "While [[Protoforge]] contains a staggering array of high powered parts, collecting all of them is one of the most difficult challenges in the game. There are many ways for things to go wrong on the map. If they do, the layout of the map is highly unforgiving, and an emergency escape may not always be possible. Combat builds may run into issues like taking lots of damage getting past [[Superfortress]], being forced to fight every bot in the back area leading to [[Alert]] or attrition issues, and getting scanned by [[Researcher|Researchers]]. Stealthier builds, especially [[Flight Units|Flight]] builds, can find it difficult to take the many powerful [[Prototype Robot|Prototype Robots]] in combat, to lose bots due to the lack of escape options in the map layout, and can often get stuck in stasis traps in a bad position.\n[[Heading]]Getting In and Out[[/Heading]]\nThe first two questions to consider when entering Protoforge are the following: How will I get into the back where all the good loot is? How will I get back out? While stealthing past a dormant Superfortress is ideal, this is not always a viable approach for every build. Fully safe stealthing requires a specific and energy-intensive set of [[Infowar]], and bad [[Operator]] placement can always wake up Superfortress even for the most well prepared build. Additionally, once inside, there are jamming-immune [[V-Series]] that will always wake Superfortress. There are a few main strategies available here:\n[[Heading:2]]Stealthing Past Superfortress[[/Heading]]\nStealthing past dormant Superfortress can be somewhat consistently achieved with either of 2 sets of specific utilities. An [[Adv. Transmission Jammer]] or better combined with an [[Adv. Cloaking Device]] or better will reduce the visual range of most bots in the starting area down to the jamming range, with the exception of the [[Overlord]] which can be usually be seen ahead of time due to its [[Exp. Active Sensor Suite]]. However, due to a quirk in line of sight calculation, a [[Visual Processing Units|Visual Processing Unit]] must be used in order to jam [[Watcher|Watchers]] at 16 tiles. Otherwise, Watchers can see Cogmind at 16 tiles but Cogmind cannot see them back, so the jammer does not apply. The other approach is an [[Adv. Visual Processing Unit]] or better combined with an [[Exp. Transmission Jammer]], although this approach is a little more likely to run into the Overlord. [[Transmission Jammers]] do have a chance to fail which will result in Superfortress powering up anyway, although this chance can be eliminated with a Jamming Amplifier. As previously mentioned, an Operator can also still make it to a [[Terminal]] and report Cogmind when turning a corner. Some form of bot detection like [[Sensor Arrays]] is always helpful to avoid unnecessary combat and risk of jammer failure.\nDue to jamming-immune bots inside the back lab area, a full stealth entry and exit is unlikely to happen. Another method will typically be required to exit the map.\n[[Heading:2]]Digging Around Superfortress[[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]Protoforge Dig 1.png|Digging from the top left room[[/Image]]\n[[Image]]Protoforge Dig 2.png|Digging from the Superfortress hallway[[/Image]]\nDigging around Superfortress is a consistent strategy that is generally preferable for grounded combat builds and less so for airborne builds because [[Cave-ins]] tend to be much more dangerous for more fragile airborne builds. This strategy involves getting a strong enough digging weapon or other digging utility to bypass the standard Superfortress-guarded opening. The downsides of this approach are the potential for multiple cave-ins and the summoning of 2 additional patrols to the map once the reinforced barrier is breached. However, for most combat builds, this solution can be safer than running all of the way past Superfortress.\nWhen performing the dig, ideally the path should be at least 2 tiles wide to avoid having to continue shooting while already in the dug out tiles in case one of the tiles collapses while walking past it. There are two best digging spots, although one is seed-dependent. The ideal digging spot is from the top left of the map. Occasionally, the map will create a room that is very close to the bottom left prototype vault. Digging from that location can be quite short, although it is not guaranteed to be there. The next best spot is to dig from the Superfortress hallway up into the Garrison room above.\n[[Heading:4]]List of Parts That Can Dig[[/Heading]]\nNote: Some parts like [[Scrap Engine]] weapon constructs can sometimes dig these walls, and other parts may be able to dig when paired with damage boosting utilities like [[Force Boosters]] and [[Particle Chargers]].\n[[List]]\n[[Cld. Nova Cannon]]|\n[[Core Cannon]]|\n[[Electromagnetic Launchers]] or [[PSU Rigger]] exploding an engine on the ground|\n[[Mak. Laser Shovel|Mak]] or [[LU-1G1's Laser Shovel]]|\n[[Matter Drive]]|\n[[Molecular Deconstructor]]|\n[[Null Cannon]]|\n[[Potential Cannon|Regular]] or [[Imp. Potential Cannon]]|\n[[Terrabomb]]|\n[[Vortex Driver]]\n[[/List]]\n[[Heading:2]]Teleporting past Superfortress[[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]Protoforge Navigation Harness.png|Possible Cep. Navigation Harness teleport paths[[/Image]]\nA few special items can allow for teleporting past Superfortress. Typical [[Transdimensional Reconstructor|Regular]] and [[Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructor|Hpw. Transdimensional Reconstructors]] can be unreliable for getting inside the lab, but there are alternate approaches to teleporting. The [[Personal Teleporter v0.10]] and [[Telecube]] both allow directional teleportation past Superfortress, albeit with a cost of random part loss.\nFor exiting the map, Transdimensional Reconstructors can really shine. A [[Dimensional Node Initializer]] placed near the exit will make for an easy escape route while deep in the lab. In fact, this is the best strategy for exiting the map due to the low cost and risk of the approach. There is even a spare Transdimensional Reconstructor available inside the [[Tinkerer]] lab for this use, although the Dimensional Node Initializer must be carried in from [[Quarantine]] or [[Caves]].\nAnother solution for teleporting out of the map is also contained within the Tinkerer lab. The [[Cep. Navigation Harness]] is difficult to use correctly, but can be used to jump outside of the lab, bypassing Superfortress. Cogmind can influence the teleport direction by making continuous moves in the same direction. Since this part's teleport works through walls, it can be used to bypass large portions of the level that would otherwise require a longer unfavorable route or digging.\n[[Heading:2]]Walking Past Superfortress[[/Heading]]\nWalking past an awake Superfortress can be a dangerous proposition, but sometimes is a necessity. Airborne builds, especially with overloadable propulsion, can get by with only a few volleys sent their way. However, grounded builds will take substantially more damage trying to do this. Evasion parts like [[Phase Shifters]], [[Reaction Control Systems]], and [[Thunder Leg|Regular]] or [[Imp. Thunder Leg|Imp. Thunder Legs]] can help reduce damage taken greatly.\nAfter Superfortress has been bypassed, keep running and don't stop to fight any bots following or else there is a risk that Superfortress will catch up and reset its 20 action memory. The best place to go after running past Superfortress to enter the back lab is into the Garrison room, out of sight. When leaving, keep going to the corner where the corridor turns back downward again.\n[[Heading:2]]Exiting Through the Garrison[[/Heading]]\nWhile it is often desirable to close the [[Garrison Access]] to avoid prototype reinforcements, there is always the option to leave through it instead. Research [[Garrison|Garrisons]] are quite tough and can add lots of Alert, although this option may be more preferable for [[RIF]] builds.\n[[Heading]]Propulsion Choice[[/Heading]]\nWhile all propulsion types can be used to loot Protoforge, [[Hover Units|Hover]] and [[Legs]] are generally the best suited for the job. [[Treads]] have a major integrity issue in the map, with only one rarely spawning type of propulsion available in the propulsion vault ([[Exp. Heavy Siege Treads]]). Treads players should expect to bring multiple backup treads into the map or switch to a different propulsion type later. Flight has more types of propulsion available, but it struggles heavily to be both combat capable to take out the prototype guards and have enough storage to take out as many parts as it wants to. [[Wheels]] are generally niche already, and the lack of good wheels on the map doesn't help the issue.\nLegs and Hover serve as ideal mid-ground propulsion types. They have plentiful high integrity multi-slot parts available in the propulsion vault and have good support and carrying capacity. They both also make great use of the [[Cep. Antigrav Storage Unit]], something that treads doesn't need and flight struggles to support at times. Additionally, both legs and hover have high-rating drop from some of the common guards. Legs are dropped by [[AP7-3|AP7-3s]], [[Hotshot|Hotshots]], and [[Immortal|Immortals]], while Hover is dropped by V-Series.\n[[Heading]]Looting the Lab Area[[/Heading]]\nAfter successfully infiltrating the lab, it's time to begin collecting loot.\n[[Heading:2]]Helpful Looting Items[[/Heading]]\n[[List]]\n[[Crosscalibrator]]: Many of the prototype parts in the lab are faulty but appear in multiples. Any part that has multiple copies can be fixed by the Crosscalibrator. A [[Subatomic Replicator]] can duplicate a rare faulty part to create two good parts.|\n[[Plexus Tether]]: The Plexus Tether will identify all prototype parts on the map with the downside of summoning a Decapitator squad if the Garrison is open. If the Garrison is shut, however, this intel is completely free.|\n[[Graphene Brace]]: Decapitators and Immortals have scary high critical effect percentage weapons, inflicting sever and impale respectively.|\nTransmission Jammers: Jamming the dormant guards in each area can allow for picking them off one at a time instead of all at once.|\nPowerful Digging Items: Digging through the walls of the map can allow for getting into vaults without being spotted by Researchers. The Cep. Plasma Driver located on the map is a good choice. A [[Warp Cannon]], while unable to dig, can serve a similar purpose by shooting around walls.|\n[[Cloaking Devices]]: Cloaking serves dual purposes. One benefit is to allow firing in rooms where Researchers are present without getting spotted. Another is to see patrols roaming the lab area before they see Cogmind. [[Visual Processing Units]] can help provide the same benefit, but don't help in opening vaults like Cloaking does.|\n[[Relay Coupler [NC]]]: Relay Couplers have multiple useful Researcher hacks. They can disable scanning functionality, assimilate Researchers to identify picked up prototypes, and identify all prototypes nearby instantly. A similar Researcher-disabling effect can be obtained at the Research Penetration Think tank in Scraptown.|\n[[Phasing AFG]]: This part can grab loot stuck in bad positions, sometimes being able to bypass dormant guards or unfortunately-positioned Researchers.|\nPlenty of backups: Due to the inconsistent placement of different vault types in the lab and the lack of normal parts on the ground, backups of essential parts are very valuable since they may show up as the last vault checked.[[/List]]\n[[Heading:2]]Exploration Order[[/Heading]]\nThe typical route to explore the Protoforge is to head to the left side first. This allows for shutting down or destroying the Garrison Access, grabbing the Crosscalibrator, and getting the prototype IDs from the Forge Research Registry Terminal early into the map. If the Garrison is shut down or destroyed, the Plexus Tether should be used right away to minimize time spent searching for useful parts. After that, plan out which rooms are worth going into and which aren't. While it's possible to loot every vault, doing this tends to be rougher on alert and build attrition.\nAfter leaving the left side, stick to the top of the corridor that leads back to Superfortress. The path is just wide enough to allow traversal without getting spotted. After hitting up the standard vaults on the right side, there are two more decisions to make. Are the guarded vault and Tinkerer lab worth hitting up? The guarded vault has some of the most powerful loot on the map but is also the most heavily guarded with 2 AP7-3s. The Tinkerer lab parts are not so powerful, but the Cep. Navigation Harness and Transdimensional Reconstructor can be used as ways out of the map. These parts can help avoid the extra patrols that will be summoned after entering the Tinkerer lab.\n[[Heading:2]]Triggering the [[Protoforge#w9_defending_0bprimeufd_assault|UFD Assault]] Before the Lab[[/Heading]]\nIt is possible and sometimes even desirable to trigger the [[UFD]] assault on Protoforge before looting the Lab, even if not planning to complete the event itself. Doing this has several advantages and disadvantages. This will stop the dispatch of all [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]], [[Assault Squad|Assaults]], and even prevent [[High Security]] from occurring. Even if the UFD readiness is low, the allies can be used as distractions and sources of looting parts like [[CPS Tube|CPS Tubes]] and [[Mak. Salvage Targeting Computer|Mak. Salvage Targeting Computers]]. The tradeoff of this decision is a much more difficult Access and [[Command]] with advanced fortification protocols activated. Additionally, it may be difficult to sneak to the exit with all of the event assaults roaming around the map.",

   "Content": "After defeating [[MAIN.C (Shell)]] in [[Command]], the [[Command#w8_fortifying_0b10surrender|surrender option]] may be selected instead of continuing to fight MAIN.C. A [[Core Reset Matrix]] or being [[Warlord (Alignment)|Warlord aligned]] while [[Warlord]] is alive will prevent this option from being selected.\nCogmind, MAIN.C, and the newly allied [[0b10]] bots must face off against waves of [[Enhanced Q-Series]]. These bots are mostly randomized, but there are some common qualities to them. They all have [[Adv. Dynamic Insulation System|Adv. Dynamic Insulation Systems]] which makes EM damage not a very reliable way to kill. They typically have another damage resistance utility or armor, although Kinetic and Thermal damage is usually effective. A 4+ [[Ballistic Cannons]] or [[Multirail]] stack is a good set to deal a lot of damage to these bots. The overall build requirements tend not to be too strict here. Cogmind does need to be able to put out a decent amount of damage and manage to keep a build well intact from backup parts and from Q-Series or 0b10 bot loot. MAIN.C does have a tendency to wander off and get overwhelmed at times, so try to keep up with him.\nOne consideration when doing this event is whether or not to go to the cache. Since Cogmind only gets 100 moves and about 40 more turns after that, it may be worth calculating the path ahead of time. If MAIN.C gets overwhelmed in the first fight, single-handedly fighting a large group of Q-Series, the event can end in failure right at the very beginning. A [[Microwarp Drive]] can help greatly here since one warp only counts as one move for the purposes of the counter.\n\n[[Heading]]Useful parts vs. Enhanced Q-Series[[/Heading]]\n[[Heading:2]][[Point Defense Systems]][[/Heading]]\nSome of the Enhanced Q-Series carry powerful [[Launchers]] that are blocked by this utility.\n[[Heading:2]][[Tractor Beams]][[/Heading]]\nThere aren't typically a lot of turns to spend running around collecting matter in this event. Being able to restock remotely can help save a lot of time and damage dealt to Cogmind.\n[[Heading:2]][[Matter Compressors]]/[[Energy Wells]][[/Heading]]\nResource storage is always useful in extended combat encounters like this.\n[[Heading:2]][[Launchers]][[/Heading]]\nWhile these should be used sparingly to avoid friendly 0b10 fire that can trigger an accidental betrayal, sometimes large groups of Enhanced Q-Series will wander into the MAIN.C room at about the same time. It is very nice to be able to attack these groups simultaneously.\n[[Heading:2]][[Phasing AFG]]/[[Portable AFG]][[/Heading]]\nDrawing loot piles closer to Cogmind can also save a lot of otherwise wasted time trying to travel a long distance to get some good loot.",

   "Content": "Assisting the [[UFD]] forces in their [[Protoforge]] assault is a task that is initially extremely challenging but can be made much easier with lots of preparation. The minimal readiness UFD will be utterly annihilated by [[0b10]] forces, leaving Cogmind up against a huge amount of bots with little assistance. On the other hand, the maximal readiness UFD can put up a solid fight against 0b10 and can even win fights well enough to plant multiple [[UFD Drillbomb|UFD Drillbombs]]. The ideal scenario is to have at least 120 Fedlink [[UFD#resource_mechanics|resources]] when beginning the event and to avoid the civil war in [[Scraptown]] which would otherwise weaken the UFD forces.\n\n[[Heading]]Primary Strategies[[/Heading]]\nThere are two main strategies for this event: Stealth based and combat based.\n[[Heading:2]]Stealth Bombing[[/Heading]]\nStealth is the easier option of the two to beat the event. With maximal UFD forces, Cogmind has to do little to no fighting in order to help complete the event. Instead, focus on remaining out of sight and planting Drillbombs. However, helping out the UFD forces here and there with launchers, especially guided ones like a [[Mni. Smartbomb Launcher]], can be an easy way to help out the UFD without risking too much damage. [[Flight Units|Flight]] is the ideal propulsion type for stealth thanks to its high speed, allowing for easily sneaking to Drillbomb planting locations and retreating back to friendly bots when caught in a bad position. [[Hover Units|Hover]] is still a good option since it tends to be more capable of taking on fights when needed. The lack of inventory is one of the biggest issues for flight, with a [[Med. Storage Unit]] being required to carry a single Drillbomb without any backups available. However, thanks to the massive number of Strikers that appear during this event, there will always be spare flight units.\nAlthough rather slow, [[Impulse Thruster Array|Impulse Thruster Arrays]] have good support and integrity. Hover is much worse off here, as the only dropped hover propulsion, [[Imp. Antigrav System|Imp. Antigrav Systems]], from [[P-80 Master|P-80 Masters]] is not very impressive. The lab area has plenty of great hover units to stock up on before or during the event as needed.\n[[Heading:2]]Combat[[/Heading]]\nHeavy combat builds are also more than capable of completing the event, even at lower UFD resource levels. One major boon to combat builds is the amount of loot and matter generated from the attack. It's very difficult to run out of crucial build elements like power, propulsion, and weapons, although the choice of parts may not always be the most desirable. Combat builds can choose between helping out with some Drillbomb planting or fully committing fighting the 0b10 waves. If Cogmind can fight up to the exit, camping nearby and using launchers at each new 0b10 wave can be a very effective strategy.\nMass Executioner spawns guarantee a limitless supply of good offensive processors. Their [[Adv. Kinecellerator|Adv. Kinecellerators]] are also a good option for any kinetic builds. They pair well with the [[Helical Railgun|Helical Railguns]] dropped by Executioners and Ovr. weaponry dropped by the [[Scrapoid|Scrapoids]] and [[Scraphulk|Scraphulks]]. While some [[Ovr. Medium Treads]] are available from Elites, they are not all that good for the depth, so it can be problematic to restock on [[Treads]]. [[Wheel|Wheels]] builds can get the [[Ovr. Huge Scrapsphere]] from Scrapoids. [[Legs]] builds have the best options available between [[Enh. Biometal Leg|Enh. Biometal Legs]] from Executioners and [[Ovr. Armored Exoskeleton|Ovr. Armored Exoskeletons]] from Scraphulks.\n\n[[Heading]]General Strategies[[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]Protoforge Alternate Dig Path.png|A good alternate path to dig out of the Protoforge area[[/Image]]\n[[Heading:2]]Eliminate the [[Garrison Access]][[/Heading]]\nThe [[Prototype Robot|Prototype Robots]] spit out from the Garrison can be a nuisance to the UFD forces. While they are not as numerous as the main [[Assault Squad|Assault]] forces, they are additional dispatches that tend to be tougher than usual bots. Shutting down or destroying the Garrison before starting the event begins is a good idea. While technically possible to do after starting the assault, running down the [[Superfortress]] hallway to shut the Garrison is pretty risky.\n[[Heading:2]]Dig to Improve UFD Routing[[/Heading]]\nThe layout of the left part of the forge area can be quite variable from run to run. Sometimes there are multiple great routes for planting Drillbombs without having to fight off many 0b10 forces. Sometimes the map ends in a giant single hallway chokepoint where it is nearly impossible for the UFD to make any progress. Don't be afraid of digging tunnels to create alternate routes to sneak past enemy forces. Being able to dig through the Forge [[Reinforced Walls#protoforge|Reinforced Barriers (80 armor)]] is often useful since the rooms on the left side tend to back up against the Forge in multiple locations other than just the entrance.\n[[Heading:2]][[Launchers|Launcher]] It Up[[/Heading]]\nDon't shy away from using Launchers during the event. Launchers are always a good tool against large groups of enemies, but some of their downsides costs are high [[Matter]] use and [[Alert]] generation. During the event, there is so much matter generated that it's impossible to ever run out. Alert during the event is irrelevant and will not cause any additional responses. Keep in mind that alert will still travel to the next map if planning to exit through the main exit instead of taking the win.\n[[Heading:2]]Useful Event Items[[/Heading]]\n[[List]][[Cloaking Devices]]: Help traverse the map and plant Drillbombs without being spotted. [[Cep. Cloak Mesh]] is available on the map in the lab area.|\nDigging parts: Digging parts strong enough to dig through the Forge Plexus area Reinforced Barriers are highly useful for getting around a chokepoint.|\nGood Launchers: Protoforge Launchers in particular are some of the most powerful options in the game and can easily wipe out squads to turn the tide in favor of the UFD forces.|[[Active Sensor Suite|Regular]] or [[Exp. Active Sensor Suite]]: The [[Investigation Squad|investigation]]-summoning effect of this part is not active during the event, leaving only the upside of powerful, long ranged and unjammable sensors.[[/List]]\n\n[[Heading]]Loot the Lab?[[/Heading]]\nThe back lab area of the map can provide lots of good items but may not always be worth going for. With a good build going into the map, there is a chance that going to the lab leads to losing the build instead of improving it. If alert is an issue, consider how likely it is that High Security will trigger before leaving, which will lock the event out altogether and possibly even kill the run.\nIf going into the lab, the other question is when? Going in before the event is a little safer since there aren't going to be any assaults wandering through the Superfortress hallway or prototypes dispatched from the Garrison, and there is the possibility that Superfortress is still dormant. After the event is begun, getting back there is more challenging, but at least there won't be any [[Extermination Squad|Extermination]] or [[Assault Squad|Assault Squads]] dispatched to the back of the lab. Depending on the UFD readiness, spending an extended amount of time in the lab can result in the UFD forces becoming overrun.",

   "Name": "Strategy/Wastes",
   "Content": "[[Wastes]] is a very dangerous [[0b10]] map that can easily demolish slower builds with [[C-40 Crusher|Crushers]]. Airborne builds have a fairly easy time escaping this map, but grounded builds will need a plan to escape intact.\n\n[[Heading]]Airborne builds[[/Heading]]\nIf Cogmind is airborne there are lots of options available. Beelining for the exit is a good strategy when allies aren't wanted or if the EMP is on. If the EMP is off, there are most likely allies on the map. Search for [[Derelict]] allies in the larger square openings on the top and bottom of the map where they can appear. They can usually take out all of the Crushers unaided. Fast speed can also allow easy kiting of Crushers around the map. Crushers do not have the most intelligent movement and can often be baited to moving to one side of the corridor. After this, quickly cross to the other side and pass out of reach. Circling back may be needed to avoid groups of Crushers.\n\n[[Heading]]Grounded Builds[[/Heading]]\nDealing with Crushers on slower builds is a much more daunting task. Crushers are slow moving but incredibly tanky and difficult to kill through conventional means. The high integrity of [[Damper Plating]] and low core exposure of only 15% makes kills inconsistent. One good strategy to kill them are critical destroy weapons such as a [[8R-AWN's Boregun]] and [[Hyp. Weapons]]. While the armor can't be destroyed with a crit, the core and compactor exposure are about 23% combined, and getting a single critical hit will either kill or disarm the Crusher immediately. To avoid corruption when the EMP is on, put on a [[Damper Plating]] and/or a [[Dynamic Insulation System]] as soon as possible after killing a Crusher. Another strategy is a meltdown build. 3 or more thermal guns can overheat the Crushers and cause them to melt.\n[[Image]]Wastes Crusher Lure.png|Crusher loop strategy[[/Image]]Fighting Crushers head on without enough firepower can usually result in essential parts of the build getting crushed onto the floor. One way to reduce the risk is to fight the Crushers in a circle around the starting corner of the map. Dig a tunnel around the starting area and shoot Crushers through it like the image on the right. Crushers are forced to take the long path around, giving plenty of time to get free shots off. However, this technique is a little risky as it is possible to get totally surrounded by multiple Crushers.\nSometimes the best option is simply to detach all parts and make a run for it. If the EMP is off, dropping parts in the corner of the map preemptively is a good idea. If the Derelict allies are on the map, they can clear out most of the Crushers for you so you can go back and pick up your parts later. Even if there are no allies around, being able to pick the parts that you want to take is a lot better than having all your parts crushed and being stuck with potentially only junk.\n\n[[Heading]][[RIF]][[/Heading]]\nUsing RIF along with a [[Datajacks|Datajack]] and [[Relay Coupler [NC]|NC Couplers]] makes each Crusher non-hostile for 3 charges a pieces. This makes the Crushers trivial to loot for maximum salvage, although the EMP can still make the process be quite annoying. Since there are 6 Crushers, the total cost is 18 charges for the whole map. Ramming these bots when neutralized this way is safe to do if running low on matter."

   "Name": "Strategy/Zion Deep Caves",
   "Content": "[[Zion Deep Caves]] is an optional challenge [[Branch]] that serves as a series of checklists. Each section of the map plays out in a similar way each time, and there are some requirements to deal with them in a consistent way. Here is a general checklist of things that will be useful throughout the map:\n[[List]]\nPropulsion/Weapon/Armor + backups: Lots of fighting is required in this map. Having backups of these more important parts will keep the build in fighting shape.|\n[[Launchers]]: These can be used for the [[Z-Imprinter]], [[Z-Light (5)|Z-Lights]], and especially for the [[Assembled]] in the wall. Multiple backups are recommended.|\n[[Electromagnetic Weapons]]: EM is the only effective way to fight [[Golem|Golems]]. EM traps like [[EM Surge Trap|EM Surge]] or [[Dirty Bomb Trap|Dirty Bombs]] can also be used, but having at least 1 EM weapon is best to be safe.|\n(Optional) [[AS-neutralizer No. 17b]]: Completely neutralizes the threat of the Assembled wall.|\n(Optional) Allies: Make the opening Z-Imprinter fight much easier to handle. [[A8]]'s grunt code (used at the [[Terminal]] at the entrance to the deep caves) and various friendly Zion bots make great allies.|\n(Optional) Dead [[Imprinter]]: Killing the Imprinter in Zion prevents her from showing up in this map. She has no weapons in Zion so taking her out there can be an easy way to skip a big threat on this map.\n[[/List]]\n\n[[Heading]]Starting Area[[/Heading:2]]\nThere isn't much threat here. There can be groups of 3 Assembled that can be easily dispatched by any weapons, although Launchers are most effective.\n[[Image]]ZDC Allies.png|Fighting the Z-Imprinter with allies[[/Image]][[Image]]ZDC Imprinter Launcher.png|Aiming past the Imprinter with a Launcher[[/Image]]\n\n[[Heading]]Z-Imprinter[[/Heading]]\nAfter entering the main open area of the map, the Z-Imprinter will spawn and head directly to Cogmind's location. 2 Z-Lights will follow the Imprinter but are much slower and will take some time to arrive. The Z-Imprinter has high evasion, 150 core integrity, and deals a large amount of damage every volley. Allies are highly recommended for this fight to help destroy her quicker and to draw fire from you. A [[Tactical Coordination Suite]] can really help out with an ally damage. [[Ranged Targeting Utilities]] or 2-slot Treads with [[Siege Mode]] are also recommended to be able to hit the Imprinter more frequently.\nFor Cogmind's build, any non-EM and non-Impact damage types will work. To get the [[Zio. Metafield Generator]], +Salvage is recommended by using guns with the best available type of [[Salvage Targeting Computers|Salvage Targeting Computer]]. Although it doesn't deal much damage, EM can be used to apply +Salvage if allies are providing enough damage output otherwise. If salvage isn't needed, using [[Explosive Launchers]] will be very effective here. Rather than aiming directly at the Imprinter, aim the launcher at a wall or at the end of its range so that the Imprinter is still hit close to the source. This will maintain a high accuracy while still dealing the bulk of the damage to the Imprinter. This technique can also be used against the Z-Lights to good effect.\nAfter the Z-Imprinter is dead, take care that your allies don't spot the Z-Technicians by the Z-Power machine. They will almost assuredly miss into the machine and end up nuking themselves, and if you're not careful, Cogmind. Beware its large 15 tile radius.\n[[Heading]]Z-Light Guards[[/Heading]]The top and bottom of the map have groups of 3 Z-Light guards. There are 2 groups on the top and one on the bottom. All of these are optional encounters. To avoid them, dig through the center of the Z-Facility and hang near the left side of the area. Enter the tunnel near the top side to avoid getting spotted by the bottom group. However, the top Z-Lights are often worth fighting because of the large number of special Zionite parts they guard. It is possible to reach the first alcove on the top right without getting spotted, but the remainder are all guarded\nIf Cogmind still has strong allies like Enhanced Grunts alive from the Z-Light encounter, it is possible to just charge in and fight them all at once. They are not as dangerous as the Z-Imprinter, but in large numbers they can still pack a large punch. Using Launchers is very effective on these bots since despite their evasion, they have relatively low core integrity. Using a [[Transmission Jammers|Transmission Jammer]] to lure them 1 at a time can also be an effective strategy if fighting with non-launcher weapons to preserve salvage. Without using a jammer, all 6 bots will be alerted simultaneously and come running right away.\n\n[[Heading]]Exit Area[[/Heading]]\nSame as the starting area, the only threat here is small groups of 3 Assembled.\n\n[[Heading]]Golems[[/Heading]]\nGolems are incredibly tanky enemies with an extreme damage output and the source of many lost runs. In order to claim a GOLEM Unit or the Exiles item, Cogmind must fight or at least run past them. With a 10% core exposure, 200 core integrity, and 15% damage resistance to non-melee damage types, trying to kill with core damage is completely impractical. The best approach is EM damage or Impact. Golems only require an average of 118 damage to corrupt them to death compared to thousands of damage with non-EM weapons. Using [[Zio. Weapon Casing|Weapon Casings]] looted earlier is helpful to preserve EM cannon integrity and avoid running out of weapons.\nDue to uneven calculations for line-of-sight and weapon range, it is possible to shoot the Golems once before you are spotted at 16 range. See the Golem 1/2 spots below for reference. This allows Cogmind to wait 2 turns before shooting to avoid any movement accuracy penalties, since every turn counts particularly hard when fighting a Golem. If using EM traps, short ranged EM weapons, or Impact weapons, see the lure images for reference. This will get Cogmind spotted, likely get shot at for 1 volley, and then draw the Golem in closer. This can avoid misses or misfires opening the GOLEM Unit chambers and accidentally triggering the wall early. However, keep in mind that if Cogmind misses or if the Golem misfires into one of the chambers, the wall will open instantly. Luring the Golems out of range where they can attack the GOLEM Unit containers is recommended. The Exiles item will typically require fighting the top Golem, but getting a GOLEM unit typically requires fighting both Golems, or at least luring a Golem closer and grabbing the unit if it drops.\n[[Gallery]]ZDC Golem Spot 1.png|16 range Golem 1 spot (safe with Cogmind misses)|ZDC Golem Spot 2.png|Golem 2 spot (unsafe with Cogmind misses)|ZDC Golem Lure 1.png|Golem lure 1|ZDC Golem Lure 2.png|Golem lure 2|ZDC Golem Trap 1.png|Golem trap 1|ZDC Golem Trap 2.png|Golem trap 2[[/Gallery]]\n\n[[Heading]]Impregnable Wall[[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]ZDC Wall Activation Zone.png|Approximate wall activation zone[[/Image]]\nThe Assembled wall is an indestructible wall containing 35 [[Assembled (4)|Assembled]] and 2 [[Assembler|Assemblers]] that will automatically open up when Cogmind gets too close to it, or if any of the GOLEM Unit chambers are destroyed. See the image on the right for a range reference. This range encompasses the GOLEM Unit containers, so fighting the wall is required to grab them.\nFighting the wall practically requires Launchers to avoid becoming overwhelmed. Any kinds of launchers work, although explosive launchers are better due to their higher base damage. Trying to use launchers at a range where they won't miss and take out the GOLEM unit containers is ideal. Otherwise it can be slightly annoying up to even deadly to have a large number of growing Golems running around. They grow slowly, but trying to deal with the Assembled and growing Golems at the same time can be a recipe for disaster. Alternately, the [[AS-neutralizer No. 17b]] can be used here to almost entirely eliminate any threat of the wall. The Assemblers will still need to be destroyed, but the rest of the Assembled will become useless.\n\n[[Heading]]Loot[[/Heading]]\nAfter everything else is cleaned out, all that's left is claiming the loot. Wall Chambers will drop [[GOLEM Unit|GOLEM Units]] when destroyed. They will turn into a Golem in a few turns, so grab them quickly. They can drop their GOLEM Unit upon being destroyed (standard loot rules), so applying positive and negative Salvage affects Golem reformation. Using melee weapons is recommended to avoid missing into other containers and spawning further Golems.\nThe Exiles item will normally require fighting both the wall and the top Golem. One alternative to grab it is using the Zion special item [[Phasing AFG]]. By using it, the item can be pulled in without any fighting on the left side of the map.",

However, direct hacks of those types remain possible after a central database lockout, and they cannot cause one in the first place. The first indirect database hack on a map cannot cause a database lockout.\nNot all lore records, parts schematic, robot analyses or robot schematics can be indirectly hacked on all Terminals. Terminals have a level of database authorization dependent on security level and current depth, equal to (10 - current depth + security level). It is only possible to indirectly hack a part/robot schematic or analysis if the Terminal's authorization level is equal to or higher than the rating/tier of the relevant part/robot (prototype parts are considered to have a +1 to their rating for this purpose).\nFor example, at -5/Factory, level 2 Terminals have an authorization level of (10 - 5 + 2) = 7, which would allow hacking for standard rating 7 parts or prototype rating 6 parts.\nLore records also have a hidden rating/tier stat. This value can only be determined by attempting and failing to access a particular record.\n[[Heading:2]]Additional Details/Usage Tips[[/Heading]]\n[[Heading:3]]Grayed Out Direct Hacks[[/Heading]]\n[[GameText]][Local Emergency Access][[/GameText]], [[GameText]][Purge Alert][[/GameText]] and all [[GameText]][Traps][[/GameText]] hacks appear greyed out in direct hacks if they are currently useless. In other words, if a Terminal has a greyed out direct [[GameText]][Locate Traps][[/GameText]] hack, then there are no traps within the Terminal's range.\n[[Heading:3]]Grouped Direct Hacks[[/Heading]]\nIf either [[GameText]][Disarm Traps][[/GameText]] or [[GameText]][Reprogram Traps][[/GameText]] is available as a direct hack, then [[GameText]][Locate Traps][[/GameText]] will also be a direct hack on that Terminal. If [[GameText]][Purge Alert][[/GameText]] is available as a direct hack, then [[GameText]][Check Alert][[/GameText]] will also be a direct hack on that Terminal. If there is a direct [[GameText]][Recall][[/GameText]] hack available, then the corresponding [[GameText]][Status][[/GameText]] hack will also be available on that Terminal.\n[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Access(Branch)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]\nCertain branch entrances are not revealed by this hack because they are either unknown to 0b10 or considered more secret/secure. The full list of these branches is: [[Lab]], [[Protoforge]], [[Section 7]], [[Scraptown]] and [[Subcaves]].\n[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Access(Emergency)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]\nThis hack reveals emergency accesses within a radius of 20 tiles of the Terminal. Within a Garrison, this reveals all emergency accesses as well as phase walls throughout the entire map.\n[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Alert(Check)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]\n[[Alert]] is reported in the alphabet form rather than as the exact precise number. For example, the Terminal reports alert level 1-A at 200 influence.\n[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Alert(Purge)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]\nThe base success rate of this hack goes down by 10% after each successful hack. This reduction only applies for the current map.\n[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Enumerate()[[/GameText]] Hacks[[/Heading]]\nEnumerate hacks reveal the current position of all bots of the matching type across the map. These positions can be enabled/disabled in the intel console window. These positions will not update in realtime. If the hack is performed again, all existing intel positions of the same type will be cleared before being added again, so the intel does not stack.\n[[Spoiler]][[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Force(Sabotage)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]\nAdds an additional 50 alert if the hack succeeds but is unsuccessful in sabotaging a machine. Adds 100 alert if the hack succeeds and sabotages a machine. Additional alert from the explosive machine does not get added like when Cogmind shoots a machine to blow it up. This can reduce alert gained in maps with huge explosive machines such as [[Hub_04(d)]]. In fact, Hub is the best place to use this hack, as blowing up a random machine is seldom useful in most other maps, and the only valid targets within the map are the Network Hubs themselves.[[/Spoiler]]\n[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Layout(zone)[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]\nReveals an the map in a 32x32 area around the map. That is, 16 tiles in each cardinal direction from the center tile of the Terminal.\n[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Inventory()[[/GameText]] Hacks[[/Heading]]\nAll stockpiles matching the hack type on the floor are revealed. This is all groups of items within a 2x2-3x3 area, even if not all tiles in the square are filled out. Occasionally, a stockpile named after one item only actually has one of that item and has other different parts. This data can be enabled/disabled in the intel console window.\n[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Prototypes[[/GameText]][[/Heading]]\nThe number of prototype IDs received is 2 on a security level 1 terminal, 3 on a level 2, and 4 on a level 3. Duplicate prototype IDs cannot be received from a single hack. This hack is never grayed out as a direct hack, even if no new prototype IDs are available.\n[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Recall()[[/GameText]] Hacks[[/Heading]]\nThe base success rate of these hacks go down by 10% after each successful hack. This only applies to hacks of the same type, not all Recall hacks. This reduction only applies for the current map.\n[[Heading:3]][[GameText]]Schematic()[[/GameText]] Hacks[[/Heading]]\nDirect schematic hacks may contain parts/bots with a rating/tier up to 2 higher than that of the base floor. For example, in -7 Factory, standard floor parts may be rating 4, but schematics up to rating 6 may be offered.\nWhen entering a map, if you already have a schematic that's supposed to appear on a Terminal, that schematic hack may be re-rolled.[[Sup]][[Terminal#references|[1]]][[/Sup]]\n\n[[Heading]]References[[/Heading]]\n[[List:Ordered]]\n[[https://www.gridsagegames.com/blog/2018/11/debugging-mapgen-seed-divergence/|Kyzrati's blog]]: \"recalling that schematic hacks at Terminals would favor the player by usually re-rolling if the randomly chosen schematic happened to be one they already had.\"[[/List]]"

Aligning with Warlord has effects on 2 major events later in the game. It triggers an event where Warlord, [[God Mode]], and friendly [[Derelict|Derelicts]] assault -2 [[Research]]. It also has a lategame effect in [[Command]]: [[Redacted]]When opening the Command seals, [[Warlord (Command)]] will appear along with a group of other friendly Derelicts.[[/Redacted]]\nOne Warlord alignment-related item is the [[Encrypted Comm Array]]. If Cogmind either compromises [[Garrison|Garrison]] or [[Sterilization|sterilizes]] [[DSF|DSFs]], Cogmind can receive the Comm Array and learn the depth of Warlord's base. If enough assistance is provided, a force multiplier can provide allies during the -2 assault and in the [[Redacted]]Command Seals[[/Redacted]]. After seeing Warlord in his base, the Comm Array is no longer of any use.\n\n[[Heading]]Restrictions[[/Heading]]\nCogmind cannot align with Warlord in the following scenarios:\n[[List]][[RIF]] is installed - The base will be hostile to Cogmind upon entering the base|Attacking [[Scraptown]] - The base will be hostile to Cogmind upon entry|[[Imprint]] - Warlord will be disappointed in Cogmind|[[UFD]] - Warlord will think Cogmind is a spy[[/List]]\n\n[[Heading]]-2 Research Assault[[/Heading]]\nThe event will begin with the alert [[GameText]]ALERT: Engineering response network critical failure, offline[[/GameText]]. More announcements will show up, but the next most important one will be [[GameText]]Warlord currently on norther/central/southern western approach. All units hit designated targets[[/GameText]] which indicates where Warlord and [[God Mode]] will appear on the map. 50 turns after entering the map, another announcement [[GameText]]Trap arrays successfully disabled[[/GameText]] will come with all traps being removed from the map. 110 after entering the maps, [[GameText]]Machine network successfully disabled[[/GameText]] will indicate that every machine on the map is now shut down except for [[Garrison Access|Garrisons]] due to the follow-up message [[GameText]]Unrecognized interference restored Garrison access controls. Oops. Just blast them.[[/GameText]] 250 turns after entering the map and every 150 turns after that, 3 different assault squad spawns will appear from Garrisons and map exits with the message [[GameText]]Unaware assault squad dispatched in northeast/southeast/southwest/northwest quadrant.[[/GameText]] The spawn location will be indicated on the map. Every 100 turns 1 Derelict squad will spawn on the left side of the map for each tunnel. After 1000 turns on the map, Warlord will tell Cogmind that it is time to retreat and to open the [[Redacted]]Cave Seals in [[Command]] for the final push. He, or a random Derelict if Warlord is not within range, will also give Cogmind a manual hack that can be applied to open the Cave Seals without any need for hackware.[[/Redacted]]\n[[Heading:2]]Downside of event[[/Heading]]\nAs a result of the Warlord assault, additional patrols will be dispatched in [[Testing]], [[Quarantine]], and [[Access]]. Patrols will increase by 40% in these maps. This is most significant in Access, upping the Patrol count from 20 to 28. A few Warlord bots will also appear at the entrance to these maps.\n[[Image]]Research Warlord Squads.png|A few Derelict squads[[/Image]]\n\n[[Heading]]Derelict Forces[[/Heading]]\nThe Derelict forces consist of many unique bots during this event. All of them appear as non-controllable allies that do not generate any alert for Cogmind. There are 3 spawn points in the form of giant tunnels. Each tunnel is dug out by a [[Borebot]] escorted by 2 [[Samaritan|Samaritans]]. They will dig straight across the map to the right side. Tiles that are dug out by Borebots are safe to travel on and will not cave-in. Warlord attack squads can vary greatly in composition but are made up of the following bots:\n[[List]][[Butcher (7)|Butchers]]|[[Commander|Commanders]]|[[Dragon|Dragons]]|[[Fireman (7)|Firemen]]|[[Guerrilla (7)|Guerrillas]]|[[Hydra|Hydras]]|[[Knight]]|[[Marauder (8)|Marauders]]|[[Martyr (7)|Martyrs]]|[[Savage (7)|Savages]]|[[Thug (7)|Thugs]]|[[Troll|Trolls]]|[[Wasp (7)|Wasps]]|[[Wizard (7)|Wizards]][[/List]]\n[[Image]]Research Warlord Assault Squads.png|0b10 Warlord response assault squad[[/Image]]The 0b10 forces come in groups of 3 bots. There are always 2 (not necessarily of the same type) of [[Executioner]], [[Striker]], and [[D-83 Annihilator]] bots along with a [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] full of bots. They roam around the map looking for bots to fight.\n[[Heading:2]][[DD-05H]][[/Heading]]\nSometimes DD-05H will appear a few hundred turns into the invasion. It will run toward Warlord and then follow Warlord around for the duration of the event. When this happens, the [[Tinkerer]] PL-HR7 will also appear at one of the invasion entrances on the left side of the map. PL-HR7 will drop a [[Warlord Statue]] that Cogmind can use.\n\n[[Heading]]Encrypted Comm Array[[/Heading]]\nIf Cogmind has aided Warlord forces by compromising Garrisons and DSFs, Cogmind may get 1 or 2 additional special escort squads based on the force multiplier. These special squads will head straight to Cogmind's location and follow. The higher the force multiplier, the stronger the squads available for escort. The special squads are as follows:\n[[List]]Bridgeowners Association: Trolls|Cat Herders: Wasps|Death Star: Martyrs|Department No. 42: Firemen|Offensive Angels: Wasps|Golden Rifles: Commanders, Geurrillas, Surgeons, and Thugs|Grunt Murderers: Thugs|Gunslingers: Guerrillas|Lair Dwellers: Hydras|Lobotomizers: Wizards|Lucky Slug: Marauders|Magnificent Bastards: Mutants|Metalheads: Mutants|Knights of the Pentagonal Table: Knights|Railsplitters: Guerrillas|Shockpunchers: Wizards|Smaug Morners: Dragons|The Professionals: Commanders, Guerrillas, Knights, Surgeons, Trolls, and Wizards|Vikings: Butchers|Viscera Detail: Butchers and Savages[[/List]]\nThis event tends to be great for Cogmind. The primary downsides is that the machine network turns off relatively early into the event and locating the desired exit can be a pain. Getting stuck in a bad position without any Derelict allies can also be painful since the assaults, particularly the prototype bots and demolishers, pack quite a punch. However, the large number of alert-free allies and free loot from the bots fighting is great to any build. Like the Revision 17 event, this event will also cause the maps to have no Heavies. Finding any exit is usually possible by following the assault dispatch notifications. Assaults will be dispatched out of any Garrison or exit. The only exits that assaults do not come from are Quarantine prefab exits. In that case, using other infowar like terrain scanning and drones is the best way to locate these exits.",
