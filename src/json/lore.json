Based on our understanding of Complex 0b10 defense distribution practices, the benefit of each fabnet expansion is reduced to 1% per installation at two depths above the Fabricator's location. Therefore two fabnets installed at -7/Factory are presumed to trigger in 6% of cases at a depth of -6, and only 2% of cases at a depth of -5. The aggregate effects are not to be understated, however, where for example four active fabnet installs on the immediately lower depth, combined with three installs on the depth below that, would provide a combined 15% chance to trigger. Given relay network defense capabilities, the total chance at any point cannot exceed 15%."

Some experimental variants instead use an enhanced gamma rifle. Alpha 7s are built with strong defensive capabilities and triple-encased core technology, enabling them to easily take on multiple opponents simultaneously, while a more advanced version of the behemoth-style critical failure prevention system provides the same advantages in a smaller frame."

While they possess significant hacking capabilities to make the most of time-critical situations, they also borrow the Lightning's EMDS and targeting systems, making them formidable even when outnumbered in combat. The latest model takes advantage of improved integrated shock resistance methods recently suggested by my researchers. Eventually a majority of programmers should be replaced with these combat variants."

While their offensive capabilities are limited to two powerful cannons, even a small army would have difficulty overcoming a Fortress before it picks them off one by one."

With enough energy to power it through extended confrontations even while protecting nearby allies, it would almost be enough to justify accompanying M Guards with additional squads of front-line robots, if not for their powerful AOE weaponry making close-quarters combat with allied forces problematic."

An experimental reaction system makes the Striker more difficult to hit on approach despite its large size. The plasma lance is highly effective at skewering target cores."

Future efforts to completely clear and protect the Proximity Caves will require a more versatile heavy attacker capable of quickly burrowing through rock. To that end, Superbehemoth frames are embedded with a weaker version of the Sigix Matter Drive, while also carrying enough different weaponry to deal with a variety of threats without supporting units."

Their built-in drive enables them to catch up to anything ever spotted coming out of the caves so far, and although they're equipped with valuable technology themselves, rather than harden them with armor and slow them down, Trackers have improved evasive capabilities to help avoid getting hit in the first place. The combination of rapid-fire Linked Autogun and Immobilizer for slowing fast targets will make derelicts think twice before raiding upper 0b10 for spare parts."
