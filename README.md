# About
Cog-Minder is a helper website for [Cogmind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x31tDT-4fQw). It has a [parts searcher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x31tDT-4fQw) that takes information from the in-game gallery CSV export and turns it into this searchable webpage, a [bots bestiary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x31tDT-4fQw) that lists all bots in the game and their stats, a [build planner](https://noemica.github.io/cog-minder/bots.html) that allows for creating a build loadout and viewing stats for it a [hacking calculator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x31tDT-4fQw) that shows hacking success rates, and a [combat simulator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x31tDT-4fQw) that predicts combat outcomes from a collection of equipped parts. It should have all items and bots as of Beta 10.2 with experimental Beta 11 support, let me know if anything seems missing. Check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x31tDT-4fQw).

This is an MIT licensed open source project with the source available on GitHub.
