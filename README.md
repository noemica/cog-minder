# About

Cog-Minder is a helper website for [Cogmind](https://www.gridsagegames.com/cogmind/). It has a [parts reference](https://noemica.github.io/cog-minder/parts.html) that displays information on all items in the game, a [bots bestiary](https://noemica.github.io/cog-minder/bots.html) that lists all bots in the game, their part loadouts, and their stats, a [build planner](https://noemica.github.io/cog-minder/bots.html) that allows for creating a build loadout and viewing stats, a [combat log analyzer](https://noemica.github.io/cog-minder/combat.html) to examine combat encounters after a run, a [hacking reference and calculator](https://noemica.github.io/cog-minder/hacks.html) that shows hacking success rates, a [combat simulator](https://noemica.github.io/cog-minder/simulator.html) that predicts combat outcomes from a collection of equipped parts, a [RIF reference](https://noemica.github.io/cog-minder/rif.html) for RIF abilities and bot hacks available, and an unofficial [wiki](https://noemica.github.io/cog-minder/wiki.html). It should have all items and bots as of Beta 14. Check it out [here](https://noemica.github.io/cog-minder/).

This is an MIT licensed open source project with the source available on GitHub.
